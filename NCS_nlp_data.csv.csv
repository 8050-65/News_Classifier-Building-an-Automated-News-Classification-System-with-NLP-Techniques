Myths and facts about wheezing in children under 5 years,"Wheezing is a widespread problem in children under 5 years old in India. According to the American Academy of Paediatrics, 50% of children would have had at least one episode of wheezing before 5 years of age. When a child wheezes, the first question that happens in one’s mind is whether the child has asthma and whether will he require medicines for a long duration. In this article let’s discuss about the myths and facts about wheezing and its treatment in children under 5 years.
Myth 1: All wheezing is asthma
Fact: It is a fact that viral infections are the most common cause of wheezing in children under five years of age. Over 60% of children who experience recurrent wheezing before the age of 5 will stop wheezing and won’t develop asthma after that age. However, if there’s a family history of asthma or allergy-related skin disease, the child may continue to wheeze even after the age of 5.
Myth 2: Inhalers are harmful and addictive when used in children
Facts: Inhalers are a safe and non-addictive medication that can be used by children to relieve and control asthma symptoms in the long run. They are considered a lifeline for most wheezing children and should be used as the first-line medication prescribed by a doctor, instead of syrups or tablets. This recommendation is supported by international organizations such as the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) for children under the age of 5.
Myth 3: Inhalers used in children are similar to what is given to adults. Will that lead to overdosage?
Fact: Aerosol delivery devices are the same for adults and children. However, the dosage and frequency of use may differ based on the age and severity of the wheeze. Also, the amount of the drug deposited in the lungs depends upon the breathing capacity of the person. Adult lungs can handle more air volume, resulting in more medication deposited for the same dosage. Pediatric lungs are smaller, so they receive less medication. It is important to consult a doctor for appropriate dosage to control symptoms.
Myth 4: Inhalers contain steroids that can harm child growth and development.
Fact: Inhalers contain steroids in microgram doses, which is 1000 times less than the dose in syrups and tablet steroids given during wheeze exacerbations. Inhalers are like ointments, in which the drug gets deposited on the surface where the action is required while oral medications when taken, get absorbed from the intestines into blood, resulting in delivery of the drug to all body parts where the action is not intended. Hence the side effects of inhalers are less as compared to oral medications.
Myth 5: Inhalers should be used only for severe cases of wheezing
Fact: Inhalers have medications that not only relieve but also prevent recurrent wheezing in the long run. Even if the child has mild persistent asthma symptoms, it is more controllable with inhalers than any other oral medications and is the standard of care.
Myth 6: Inhalers can cure asthma
Fact: Inhaler medications are classified into two categories – relievers and controllers. Relievers are used to alleviate wheezing, while controllers are given to prevent recurrent wheezing in children. Asthma or any allergy can be managed with medications and avoidance of triggers. It’s important to note that control is possible, but cure is not. However, as previously mentioned in this article, most children who experience wheezing before the age of 5 are not affected by allergies or asthma, and their symptoms may improve after the age of 6.
Myth 7: Nebulizers are better than inhalers and can be used at home
Fact: Nebulizers are helpful for sick children who have difficulty breathing and wheezing. However, for children who do not have breathing problems, inhalers are more than enough to provide relief. It is not safe to use nebulizers at home for children under 5 years old, as using home machines without oxygen can lead to a decrease in oxygen levels and unconsciousness. Instead, inhalers can be used at home. If there is no improvement with inhalers, it is important to consult a pediatrician or go to the emergency room for further treatment.
In conclusion, wheezing in children is mostly due to viral infections. Inhalers are a safe and effective way to manage wheeze in children under 5 years of age. It is essential to help build awareness about inhalers as they form the most important way by which wheeze is treated. Parents and caregivers should consult with their child’s doctor to ensure that their child is using inhalers correctly and effectively.

A guide to supporting teens through anxiety,"These days, anxiety has become a part of our daily conversations. In adolescence, where the spotlight effect is high, which is basically where teenagers feel that they are the protagonist of a full-blown Bollywood plot, anxiety becomes a byproduct of it.
As parents, here are a few tips on how you can help your teen deal with anxiety.
Begin by accepting the term itself
A lot of times, parents dismiss anxiety, thinking that feeling worrisome is natural. However, understanding the difference between chronic anxiety and temporary worry is important. Dismissing their symptoms and feelings can make your teen feel invalidated and uncomfortable, which further exacerbates their tendency to overthink.Advertisement
Identify symptoms of anxiety
Anxiety often masks itself as distress; therefore, knowing the red flags can help you avoid confusion. Some of the common manifestations in adolescence may be through having difficulty concentrating in academics, being unable to sleep at night due to a myriad of thoughts, being tense and fidgety, feeling restless without apparent cause, experiencing frequent spells of crying and complaints of feeling lonely and lost, and changes in appearance, appetite, and sleep.
Respond to their anxiety gently
It can get overwhelming for parents to understand why a child is feeling the way he or she is despite having appropriate resources. It is at this juncture where your response can allow your teen to confide in you or move away. A gentle response and positive questioning about what triggers make him/her feel anxious will provide reassurance and encouragement for them to share without any hesitation.
Help them build coping skills
Rather than avoiding dealing with their issues, helping them to build a repository of coping skills like giving positive feedback, praising their competency, and holding their hand in the face of setbacks can facilitate in reducing their negative thoughts. Teaching them to constructively utilise breaks like doing breathing exercises, journaling their thoughts down, etc., can also play a pivotal role in redefining their perspective.
Elevate their self-esteem
Teens who have high self-esteem and worth tend to do better as adults under pressure and uncertainty. As parents, you can try to elevate their self-esteem by making them see through their strengths and making them aware of their weaknesses and how they can slowly adapt to their surroundings.Advertisement
In any case, if as parents you feel things are getting out of hand, don’t hesitate to seek professional help.

How you can help your teen tackle Board examination jitters,"The board season is here! Stress is at an all-time high, Wi-Fi is running in full swing, textbooks are found in every corner of the house, sticky notes are stuck on bathroom mirrors, major family functions are being given a miss, and all your dinner table discussions revolve around practical files, admit cards, and pen packets get emptied before that cup of coffee gets over. Welcome to the household of a teen prepping for Board examinations.
Understandably, both teens and their parents are visibly worried as the board season approaches. Constant advice from relatives, tuition teachers, and school coordinators makes the teen feel overwhelmed. It is almost as if the parent is reliving their own old good board days where sacrifices are made to ensure utmost discipline and focus.
Here is what you can do as parents, guardians, and well-wishers to ease out the jitters.Advertisement
Consider boards as just another exam
With the recent changes in board exams post-COVID, it has become essential to take notice of the policy changes that are trying to not just see only board marks as credits of merit. A student’s worth is not defined by the score but by the passion and explorations they discovered in school life. Thus, motivating them to perform better rather than pressurising works like magic. Understand that your ward’s scores are not the representation of family respect and societal reputation; it’s a plain indicator of their understanding of the subject, and not every child can be brilliant at every domain.
Monitor their development and create a self-care routine
Parents often want their wards to get the best scores for a better future. But more than perfection and high scores, what you should be focusing on is development and consistent progress. Give them enough space and time to create a routine where they find time not just for studies but also self-care. Encouraging cool-down breaks reinforces your teen’s faith in you that you are not solely focused on their scores but also compassionate towards the intrinsic stress they are experiencing and maybe are unable to verbalise at the moment.
Recognise signs of distress
Optimal stress can facilitate peak performance. However, if there is too much arousal that even basic functionality is being compromised, recognise that your child is in distress. There are different somatic, cognitive, physiological, and emotional signs of distress. Under any circumstance, do not label these signs as mere excuses or escape routes. It is a call for help where your child needs affection, love, care, and your presence to comfort them of their anxieties. In case it does not work, do not hesitate to reach out for professional support.
Create a conducive learning environment
As your child navigates the challenging period of board exams, your support as a parent is pivotal. Providing a space free from distractions, unnecessary arguments, and expectations can enhance your child’s academic journey — be it ensuring that your child gets an optimal 7-hour uninterrupted sleep, little reminders to take breaks as they sit and study for long hours, maintaining supervision on overuse and misuse of gadgets, providing healthy nourishment, and getting a calm environment to study can go a long way.Advertisement
Get some fun
In the end, it’s essential to spend some good time with your teen. Create a refreshing song playlist, play games with them, go for random ice cream outings, and humor them about how things were so much easier in your old good times (for a change). Academic intelligence is only one domain of intelligence. If you feel your child studies too much or too little, just remind themselves and yourselves that life is a process, and instead of chasing milestones, it’ll be beautiful to immerse in the journey.

How to detect if your teen has Borderline Personality Disorder,"Being a teenager is difficult. Teens go through many changes, including social and educational changes and hormonal mood swings. Sometimes teens act without thinking if they will get into trouble, with out-of-character actions, thoughts and feelings all being part of the typical teen experience. Other times, emotions may overpower a teenager, maybe even control their actions. Some young people may also spend a lot of time being overly worried about social situations. It’s important to be able to tell the difference between “typical” teen moodiness and signs of a mental health condition, such as BPD. Below you can learn more about the condition to understand what typical teen behaviour may be — and what may be a sign that help is needed.
Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a complex mental health condition in which people often struggle with self-image, mood swings, impulse control, an intense fear of abandonment and low feelings of self-worth. BPD may cause people to have a difficult time controlling their emotional reactions to certain situations. It’s not unusual for people with BPD to live with other mental health conditions, such as eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder.
As the disorder is common and complex — it’s important to recognise its signs and symptoms. The sooner BPD is diagnosed, the faster it can be treated.Advertisement
What Does Emerging BPD Look Like in Teens?
Like with any mental health diagnosis, what’s within a normal range for that person’s age, culture, and so, is taken into consideration. When mental health professionals consider a BPD diagnosis, they look for the following key symptoms:

An intense fear of abandonment
Unstable relationships with family members and friends
An unclear or constantly shifting self-image
Impulsive or self-destructive behaviours
A pattern of self-harm
Extreme emotional swings, particularly in response to seemingly minor issues
Chronic feelings of emptiness or loneliness
Explosive periods of anger
A feeling of being out of touch with reality

The following are significant symptoms that may indicate borderline personality disorder in a child or teenager.
Behavioural Dysregulation
This is one of the first signs people may notice, with some teens engaging in self-harming behaviour. They may cut themselves, burn or pick their skin, or punch a wall. Plenty of other issues may appear as well: the child or teen may use substances or engage in dangerous sexual behaviour.
Relationship Problems
Many kids and teens with emerging BPD have trouble managing relationships. They may have an intense fear of abandonment or may have trouble controlling their anger. When very emotionally distressed, some teens may hold irrational or paranoid beliefs. These fears and beliefs may make it hard to develop friendships or romantic relationships.Advertisement
Strong Emotional Reactions
There may be strong emotional reactions to seemingly minor issues, where they may appear to overreact to everything. Minor issues may feel like the end of the world. It is difficult for health care professionals and parents to look at these signs and know whether an adolescent has emerging BPD or if the individual is simply going through a normal teenage phase.
With this in mind, a teenager who displays any or all of the characteristics associated with BPD might look around and ask themselves: “Does it seem that other people can deal with things I can’t deal with?” or “Why aren’t others struggling like I am?”
A teenager who feels strong emotions for longer periods than others or takes longer to get back to their emotional baseline may have the condition. Strong reactions to seemingly small irritations — a sense that minor issues feel like the “end of the world” and that behaviours like self-harm, drugs, or death seem to be the only way to make these stop — could be signs of a serious problem.
Teens with these actions and reactions should seek help for their symptoms.Advertisement
How Does BPD Develop in Children and Teens?
Just like adults, kids react to situations with their own unique responses. If you were to touch the arm of a very ticklish child and touch the arm of one who isn’t, they would react very differently. The same holds true when it comes to the reactions of people with borderline personality disorder versus those without it.
When children grow up in a social or family environment that does not match their temperament, they may develop poor self-esteem and a lack of self-confidence. They may have a hard time trusting others and have issues with their own identity.
When these children become teens, they can feel lost and engage in high-risk behaviours. They may look for ways to deal with feelings of emptiness; this is when symptoms of BPD can emerge.
Teens can begin to experience periods of depression, which can easily progress into self-harming behaviour or thoughts of suicide. These issues require immediate attention and the introduction of effective treatment.Advertisement
Any thoughts, feelings, or signs of self-harm must be addressed as quickly as possible.
It’s important to know that BPD is treatable. It is possible for teens and their families to find relief after an accurate diagnosis has been made and the teen is engaged in evidence-based treatment and therapy.",parenting
Here’s Everything You Need to Know About Pregancy & Stomach Pain,"Stomach pain during pregnancy can happen for various reasons, and it can show up in different ways, making it challenging to diagnose and treat. About 0.5% to 2% of pregnancies may require surgery for stomach pain that is not related to pregnancy. Quick diagnosis and timely surgery can improve outcomes for both the mother and baby.
Dealing with stomach pain during pregnancy comes with its own set of challenges, including difficulties in physical examination, changes in lab results, and hesitation in using certain diagnostic techniques. The causes of stomach pain during pregnancy can be related to the pregnancy itself or unrelated to it. Some conditions can be triggered by pregnancy, while others may have different origins but appear similar to stomach pain.
Ultrasound is the preferred imaging technique during pregnancy because it is readily available, portable, and does not involve ionizing radiation. Laparoscopy, a surgical procedure, is considered a safe and effective option, and the open-access technique is considered safer than the closed technique.
Causes of Stomach Pain During Pregnancy 
Pregnancy-related causes (Obstetric):

Early pregnancy: Miscarriage, Ectopic pregnancy, Molar pregnancy, Ovarian cyst (Torsion, Hemorrhage, Rupture), Degeneration of uterine fibroids, Round ligament pain
Late pregnancy: Placental abruption, AFLP (Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy), Abdominal pregnancy, HELLP Syndrome, Rupture uterus, Fibroid degeneration, Fallopian tube torsion, Uterine torsion, Rupture rectus muscle, Polyhydramnios, Symphysis diastasis, Intraperitoneal bleed

Non-pregnancy-related causes (Non-Obstetric):

Exacerbated by pregnancy: Extra abdominal etiology
Surgical: Appendicitis, Cholecystitis, Biliary colic, Acute pancreatitis, Peptic ulcer, Urolithiasis, Intestinal obstruction, IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease), Rupture aneurysm, Trauma
Medical: Gastroenteritis, Porphyria, Sickle cell crisis, Deep vein thrombosis, GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease), Gall bladder diseases, Acute cystitis, Acute pyelonephritis, Musculoskeletal pain, Cardiac pain, NSAP (Non-specific abdominal pain), Pleuritic pain, Psychological causes, Drug abuse or withdrawal, Herpes zoster infection

 ACUTE ABDOMEN PAIN IN PREGNANCY
KEY POINTS FOR HANDLING STOMACH PAIN DURING PREGNANCY

Take a comprehensive approach to diagnose and treat stomach pain.
Classify it into pregnancy-related and non-pregnancy-related causes.
The growing uterus can affect nearby organs and stretch the abdominal wall, leading to typical clinical signs.
Pregnancy-related changes in blood and biochemical parameters may affect lab results.
Acute Appendicitis is the most common non-obstetric cause.
Life-threatening obstetric causes include ruptured ectopic pregnancy, placental abruption, and uterine rupture.
Ultrasonography is the first choice for imaging.
Consider MRI without gadolinium as a secondary imaging option.
Perform the Kleihauer-Betke test in cases of major trauma.
Consult a multidisciplinary team involving surgeons, radiologists, and critical care physicians.
Do not delay surgical intervention when in doubt.
Laparoscopic surgery is safe and feasible in specific situations

In conclusion, the expert highlighted the importance of adapting your parenting approach to their individual needs and personalities. “Addressing and improving the parent-child relationship often involves self-reflection, open communication, and, in some cases, seeking professional support, such as counseling or therapy, to work through challenges and develop healthier dynamics,” Sharma said.",parenting
Go slow to go farPremium Story,"Imagine if we could zoom out and view the earth from a wide lens at about 30,000 feet and witness the daily lives of urban people as if on time-lapse mode. What would we see? People dashing off in the morning to school/college/work, meeting deadlines, a flurry of after-school activities, honking through traffic jams, grabbing quick meals, endless scrolling, checking and rechecking emails, surfing through TV channels, catching up with friends or family, crashing out to wake up to an alarm to start the cycle again.
Now what if we could zoom in on one such harried person and asked them what was happening? What is all this urgency about? What would they say? Maybe they might say, “There is never enough time to do everything on our to-do lists – the only way we can manage is if we speed up.” And we might ask the person, “But why?” They might look at us as if we have lost our minds and say, “This is life, you have to keep up or you are out of the game.”
The game of speed has become the currency of our times. Our culture condemns anything slow. The faster the better – be it food, shopping, internet, fashion trends, entertainment, learning, travel, work – everything instant, everything at the click of a key. But at what cost? Zoom out again and you see the arctic ice is melting, the pandemic has killed millions, and people can barely breathe in our over-polluted, overpopulated cities but we are too busy to step away from the treadmill of our frenetic lives. Zoom back in and we see the impact of it on people’s health and well-being.Advertisement
If I were to pick up a common theme that most people seem to be struggling with it would be,” “I am not doing enough,” “I am too slow,” leading to the conclusion, “I am unworthy.” We have internalised the cultural propaganda of constant racing so it should not come as a surprise that our mental health struggles are at an all-time high.
Sana’s day started at 5 am when she got ready for her football practice, after which a full day of school, then back home followed by either dance, creative writing class or a planned play date, then back home to do her homework, dinner, reading time before bed. She had come to me with her mother as she had not been sleeping well at night. She told me, “I am constantly feeling guilty that I am not doing enough and that I am a loser.” Sana is just an eight-year-old in Grade 3. I shudder to imagine what it would be like when she hits the tuition and coaching circuit in high school. From the time they are little, children have been brought up with a constant hum of, “Hurry,” “Do it now and do it fast.” Like clockwork toys, we keep winding them up, and when all that pressure starts taking a toll on them, we criticise them for being a “loser,” and not up to speed.
Shyla is a lot older than Sana, but she had lived in what she called, the “hamster wheel of dopamine high,” for many years. The constant buzz of getting things done can be really seductive. There is a heady rush as we tick off things from our never-ending to-do list, but this hustling comes at a cost too. We stumble forward exhausting our energy from one surge demand to another. If an eight-year-old is feeling guilty about not doing enough, then we really have to pause and reflect on what steps we need to take to opt out of the tyranny of the “hamster wheel” culture.
Act of refusal – I resonate so much with Jack Halberstam’s quote from his wonderful book, Queer Art of Failure (Duke University Press, 2011), “Failing at something that society has told us to do can be a revolutionary act.” These micro-acts can be as tiny as talking slowly (I had to teach myself that), doing one thing at a time, refusing to do things that drain us out like endless scrolling on Instagram, Netflix binges, meaningless socialising, taking on too many projects, keeping a perfect home etc. These step-backs might seem trivial but you will be amazed at the ripple effect they can have in our over-committed and over-engineered lives. Why speed race the rest of our time on earth and wonder at the end where it all went?Advertisement
Put guardrails on what matters – While I was writing this column on a Sunday, our cat, Tula, tried to nudge the laptop off me so that he could nestle in. As I tried to push him away, the irony of the situation hit me. I was writing about slowing down while I was racing for the deadline myself. I put the writing away and curled up with Tula for an hour-long nap in the winter sun. It was a delightful experience I might have lost out on for the sake of speed. Our life is what we pay attention to. What are you paying attention to in the 168 hours of your week? If I had been more intentional about my time in the previous week, I might have spent less time on answering endless emails (Sisyphean task!), watching useless shows on OTT, and missed a social event that did not mean much to me. I might have used that time to slowly work on my column rather than rushing through it on Sunday and depriving myself of sun-soaked catnap (pun intended).
Go slow to go far – I am a keen campaigner for a slow life though you can see I have serious lapses. In narrative practice, we have a mantra – “Go slow to go far” and there is so much wisdom in this. Our conversations in therapy can become more meaningful and the impact on people’s lives stronger when we slow things down. It sounds quite counter-intuitive, doesn’t it? Suppose we take an example of writing a book. I hear this very often from people, “I want to write a book, but I do not have time.” Actually, they can find time as less than just taking out one hour a day or little longer stretches during weekends and holidays. Slowly and slowly brewing that idea, diving deep to reflect, loiter and create. You will be amazed at how your mind can create magic when it is not working like a hyperactive beehive. As a parent you can find that one thing that your child loves to do, what is important for them – dancing, sports, art, reading, music, writing., anything. Try to make sure they have fun with that activity, without any urgency, every day and see them build the skills for a slow life. Shyla explained to me, “What matters is a slow, engaged, intentional and curated life.” So as 2024 rolls out, let’s slow down, savour the metaphorical winter sun and loiter with intent.",parenting
How parents can discuss romantic relationships with their teens,"Being a teenager is challenging, but parenting a teenager is even harder. When the entire world seems like a Bollywood movie for your no-longer-a-baby, and the world exhilaratingly holds its breath as your teenager debuts into real life, all a parent wishes is that their child chooses the path leading to a safe and beautiful life. In the midst of myriad challenges, one of the major awkward aspects for a teenage parent is how to discuss romantic relationships openly without seeming judgmental and intimidating.
Here are a few ways that can help settle your nerves down and put forward prompts on how to take the conversation forward:
Create a safe space
Begin by gently explaining and accepting that attraction and having romantic thoughts about the opposite or same sex is completely normal. In India, often such conversations meet with shame and suspicion; therefore, it’s important that we give our children a safe space where they can open up to you about their feelings.Advertisement
Use gender-neutral terms
Rather than assuming who your teenager is attracted to, use gender-inclusive language. That will allow the teen to place trust in you as a parent and will allow easy flow of communication. Make sure to have this conversation in private to protect the vulnerable feelings your teen may be feeling at the time.
Explain the difference between infatuation and love
As the teenager grows, the touch of the opposite or same sex can generate curiosity and the urge to explore. It is at this stage that it’s significant to make your child understand that infatuation involves goosebumps, butterflies in the stomach, impulsive urges to take the first step, while love is something that builds slowly, encapsulating warmth, joy, trust that comes with time. Rushing to label relationships can be detrimental as adolescents often attach long-term expectations which may not necessarily culminate into reality.
Be respectful and integral
It’s quite possible that you may be bewildered by what you may hear from your adolescent, but it’s essential to maintain your calm and show dignity to your child’s opinion and individuality. Validating how they feel fades away the jitters and most likely reinforces your child to turn to you for guidance rather than seeking outside unsolicited advice. Always remember to let your teen talk. It doesn’t matter whether they are right or wrong; it’s more important that they are real with you. Raise your words, not your voice.
Lead the way by example
At times, what social media portrays as a “goals” relationship where possessiveness is normalized as love, it’s the duty of the parents to draw the line and explain the concept of healthy and unhealthy boundaries. Teenagers will naturally be attracted to vicariously learn through movies, web series, etc., what a healthy relationship may look like, but it’s very likely far from reality. Talk to them about how having appropriate boundaries can cultivate relationships and friendships maturely. Have a healthy, loving environment where your child can learn that having a fight doesn’t mean the end of a relationship, but resolving a fight with compassion and understanding can make things go a long way.Advertisement

Take care of your newborn baby’s skin in winter with these expert-approved tips,"Taking care of your newborn baby is a daunting task. However, in the process of ensuring your kid’s well-being, many new parents overlook the importance of providing equal care to their baby’s delicate skin. Every season brings its own challenges, but winter is especially hard on the baby’s skin, according to experts. “The winter season with extreme cold temperature, low humidity and moisture levels, and excessive indoor heating can be extremely harsh on a baby’s sensitive skin,” Dr Shamik Ghosh, senior consultant, paediatrician, Bhagirathi Neotia Women and Childcare Hospital, tells indianexpress.com in an interaction.
Since the outer most layer of the skin of your baby’s skin is almost 30% thinner as compared to yours, it loses moisture twice as quickly, and is more prone to irritation and damage. “During winter, it is crucial to protect a baby’s skin barrier from irritation and dryness from Day 1 by building a thorough skincare regime with moisturisation being the most important aspect,” Dr Ghosh highlights.
If you are wondering where to start, Dr Ghosh shares some tips for parents to protect their baby’s skin and create an effective skincare routine during winter.Advertisement
1. Avoid excessive bathing
While it’s important to keep your baby clean, excessive bathing during the winter can make their skin more vulnerable. Bathing too frequently or with very hot water can strip the baby’s skin of its natural oils, leading to dryness and irritation. Instead, opt for shorter, lukewarm baths and limit them to a few times a week during the winter months. As a baby’s skin is more prone to dryness, choose a gentle soap or cleanser with a balanced pH formula specially designed for them. After the bath, pat the baby’s skin dry instead of rubbing it, and immediately apply a cream or lotion to seal in the moisture.
2. Choose a pH-balanced cleanser that gently cleanses baby’s skin from Day 1
As a baby’s skin is very sensitive, using harsh cleansers with high pH levels can harm their skin, causing dryness, redness, and discomfort. It is recommended to look for cleansers that are pH balanced with baby-safe ingredients like naturally derived coconut and glycerin, known to be moisturising and gentle on babies. Additionally, opt for cleansers labeled as clinically proven and hypoallergenic to minimise the risk of triggering allergic reactions or skin irritations.
3. Massage your baby gently
As part of a healthy skincare routine, massaging your baby is very beneficial in nourishing the baby’s skin as well as improving sleep and enhancing neurological and neuromotor development. During the winter, it is recommended to give the baby a massage after the bath.
Choose a massage oil, cream, or lotion that contains ingredients like Coconut and Sunflower oils, which moisturise and are fast-absorbing. The Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) has put in place standardised guidelines to ensure quality pediatric skincare for neonates, infants, and children. According to the IAP guidelines, emollients marketed as natural, herbal, and organic should be used with caution. Additionally, parents should refrain from using natural olive oil and mustard oil as moisturising agents, as they can cause erythema and disruption in skin barrier function.Advertisement
4. Use moisturisers that provide day-long protection against skin dryness
During winter, the importance of moisturising as part of the overall skincare regime cannot be emphasised enough. A good moisturiser hydrates the skin and acts as a barrier against the cold weather. Parents must choose the right cream or lotion designed to protect a baby’s skin from Day 1, with ingredients like milk protein, essential vitamins, aloe, chamomile, and glycerine to keep the baby’s skin soft, supple, and nourished. Such ingredients are effective anti-irritants and strengthen the skin’s protective barrier to prevent moisture loss, especially during winter months. Choose quick-absorbing and non-sticky products specifically to provide minimal irritation and maximum hydration.
It is also recommended to use baby cream for the face and baby lotion for the body. Since the baby’s face is most exposed to the cold wind, it is important to keep the baby’s cheeks hydrated to prevent dryness.

The digital dilemma: How screen time impacts kids’ nutrition,"Written by Manvi Lohia












In a world where digital devices are nearly as common as toys, screens, and devices have taken over our lives to an extent that regulating screen time isn’t always possible. Concerns about the impact of screen time on the nutritional health of children cannot be overstated. As a Registered Dietitian, I strongly believe that there are both positive and negative effects of screen time, but the latter has always outweighed the former, which calls for parents to monitor their children’s unhealthy relationship with screens, as the ubiquity of screen time poses significant challenges to our kids’ eating habits and their nutritional well-being. Therefore, it is always advised that, while screens are a significant part of modern childhood, exercising caution regarding the influence of screen time is crucial for their growth and development.
Screen time and its impact on eating behaviors
Research from the Indian Academy of Pediatrics reveals that a considerable proportion of toddlers are spending hours in front of the television daily, which can shape their eating habits persistently (Indian Academy of Pediatrics, 2020–2021). There are numerous studies that have established a link between excessive screen time and obesity in children, identifying extended television viewing as a factor in childhood obesity. Food marketing through media is another significant factor connecting screen time with the consumption of unhealthy foods, leading to subsequent weight gain. Additional factors like reduced physical activity, the intake of calorie-dense snacks, and altered sleep patterns due to screen time contribute to this issue, influencing hormonal changes that regulate hunger and satiety.Advertisement
Physiological and psychological considerations
From a physiological standpoint, screen time, as a form of sedentary behavior, is linked to lower energy expenditure. However, its impact on food intake and dietary quality is more complex. Screen time can lead to increased snacking, often on energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods. This habit and reduced physical activity can contribute to an energy imbalance and potential weight gain. Among children, excessive screen time is linked to a variety of health risks such as the early onset of hypertension, heart problems, hyperlipidemia, and other health risks, which have direct associations with sedentary screen time behavior as a result of lower physical activity and poor sleep quality.
Psychologically, screen time during meals distracts from mindful eating. This distraction can impair the ability of children to recognize satiety cues, leading to overeating or inadequate consumption of nutrient-rich foods. Furthermore, the content viewed on screens, such as advertisements for unhealthy foods, strongly influences food preferences and choices.

In exploring the relationship between diet quality and screen time, it’s essential to consider broader lifestyle patterns. The significance lies in examining cluster behaviors, including physical activity, fruit, and vegetable consumption, alongside screen time. This holistic view acknowledges that screen time is one part of a larger lifestyle pattern that can impact dietary quality. It implies that longer screen time correlates with unhealthier dietary habits and a less favorable lifestyle profile among the kids, even after adjusting for several covariates.
Implications for parenting and education
For parents and educators, this information underscores the need for a balanced approach to screen time. Ensuring right nutrition for children is an art that parents should inculcate for their child’s overall health and wellbeing. Parents are encouraged to play an active role in managing their children’s screen time by setting clear limits on device usage. It is also advantageous to designate specific times free from digital devices fosters open discussions within the family. Mealtime, in particular, can be a valuable moment for family engagement. By promoting focused eating without the distraction of screens, parents can enhance the quality of these shared experiences.Advertisement

To further enrich mealtimes, consider introducing theme nights or engaging meal kits that not only make dining more interactive for kids but also add an element of excitement to the family routine. It’s not just about restricting screen time but also about creating enjoyable alternatives that encourage meaningful connections. Lastly, take the time to inform your family about the numerous benefits associated with screen-free meals. Emphasize the positive impact on communication, mindfulness, and overall well-being, fostering a shared understanding of the importance of balancing technology use with other enriching activities.
Understanding the nuanced relationship between screen time and children’s nutrition is pivotal. The interplay between screen time and nutrition in children is a multifaceted issue that extends beyond simple cause-and-effect. As we navigate this digital age, it’s crucial to understand these complexities and implement strategies that promote healthy eating habits and balanced screen time usage. By doing so, we can support the overall health and well-being of our children, setting them up for a healthier relationship with food and technology.

How to reduce the chances of myopia in children,"In an era where digital devices are ubiquitous, the incidence of childhood myopia, or nearsightedness, is on the rise. This common vision condition, if not addressed timely, can lead to serious eye problems in the future. Understanding myopia and taking proactive steps in its management is crucial for parents to ensure their children’s visual health.
What is myopia and why does it occur in children?
According to Dr Abhinav Singh, senior consultant, Sharp Sight Eye Hospitals, myopia is a refractive error where distant objects appear blurry while close ones are seen clearly. “It occurs when the eye’s shape causes light rays to bend (refract) incorrectly, focusing images in front of the retina instead of on it. In children, myopia can progress rapidly with age, especially during growth spurts.”
The exact cause of myopia is often a mix of genetic and environmental factors. Increased screen time, less time spent outdoors, and intensive near work like reading and writing can contribute to its development in children.Advertisement
Decreasing the chances of childhood myopia
According to Dr Mohd Haseeb Beg, consultant opthalmologist, Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, parents can encourage outdoor activities, limit screen time, and ensure proper lighting during activities.

Adding on to that, Dr Singh expanded:
1. Limit screen time: In the digital age, limiting screen time is challenging yet essential. Encourage children to take regular breaks from screens to reduce eye strain. Following the 20-20-20 rule (every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds) can be effective.
2. Balanced diet: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and fish can contribute to good eye health. Nutrients like Vitamin A, C, E, and omega-3 fatty acids are crucial for maintaining healthy eyes.Advertisement
3. Regular eye exams: Early detection is key in managing myopia. Regular eye exams can help in identifying myopia early and deciding on the best course of action.
General practices for good vision in children
1. Proper lighting: Ensure that children have adequate lighting while reading or working on tasks. Poor lighting can contribute to eye strain.
2. Encourage reading and writing habits: While moderation is key, reading and writing can help in the overall development of the eye’s focusing system. Ensure that children maintain a healthy distance from their books and screens.
3. Be alert to symptoms: Watch for signs like squinting, frequent headaches, or holding books too close to the face. These may indicate vision problems.Advertisement
4. Educate about eye health: Teach children about the importance of eye health and good practices like not rubbing their eyes and maintaining hygiene to avoid infections.",parenting
How can adolescents deal better with change,"Humans are creatures of habit. Even when we welcome it, change takes more energy. So perhaps it’s not surprising that children often find it difficult to make transitions between activities, places and objects of attention. Adolescence is a time of self-discovery and identity formation, when young people begin to establish a sense of who they are, what they believe in and where they fit in the world.
According to Greek philosopher Heraclitus, you can’t step into the same river twice, for you aren’t the same person at each visit and the water is ever flowing. This encapsulates a formidable way to represent the reality of impermanence: Everything is always changing. There are several milestones in a child’s life. From being an infant to a toddler to becoming a school-going kid, a child has to survive through various stages of childhood.
But one of the most difficult transitions in a child’s life is when he or she enters the teenage world. Apart from experiencing physical transformations, they also have to take on the challenges life puts in front of them. That’s when things, relationships, mentality and mindsets begin to change and develop.Advertisement
WHY BUILDING A POWERFUL SELF-IDENTITY FOR ADOLESCENTS MATTERS
Adolescence is a sensitive development window, and a pivotal time for self-discovery and identity formation for young people. During this critical stage of development, young people start to figure out who they are, what their beliefs are and how they see themselves fitting into the world.
DIVING DEEPER INTO THE REALM OF CARING FOR ADOLESCENTS
Teenage problems are real and must be understood sensitively by parents. Teenage problems must be dealt with in a more empathetic manner by parents. The gap between parents and teenagers is wide because of the fast-moving pace of Millennials. Every topic of discussion turns argumentative and lands the situations being misunderstood and miscommunicated between the two poles apart parties: parents and teenagers. Parents have the tendency of feeling alienated by teenagers. Teenagers tend to develop the nature of being secretive and uncooperative with their parents.
FINDING EASE WITH TRANSITION IN EVER-CHANGING TIMES
While transitions can be stressful, dealing with the transition can even be scarier than the change itself. However, by acknowledging the transition period you’re in and understanding the challenges, you can develop coping mechanisms to get through it. This enables you to smoothly navigate the various transitions in life.
While a life transition can be deemed as any major life event that alters our sense of self, purpose, and how we go from day to day, knowing that you are not alone puts things into perspective. When changes occur, I recommend you maintain healthy behaviours including seeking social support, getting a good night’s sleep, eating healthy, and maintaining an exercise routine.Advertisement
WHAT ARE SOME WAYS ADOLESCENTS CAN ADOPT TO DEAL WITH TRANSITION?
A key benefit of supporting adolescents in creating a strong identity early on in life is that it can foster continued positive impacts on mental health through adulthood. There are a few ways parents, teachers and other adults can support adolescents navigate their way through this critical stage of development.
Here’s a multifaceted approach in which we can support adolescents in building a powerful self-identity:
Build a strong relationship: When it comes to parenting, strengthening your bond with your child is important. During their formative years, they’re naive, dependent and much likely to seek your help and advice, that’s when you should establish your role of a mentor in their lives.
Focus on physical health, but also build strong mental capacity: Bringing up a healthy, strong kid is of utmost importance. But it is as important to develop good mental health hygiene. The teen years are full of challenges. There are physical, mental and emotional hurdles that they are likely to experience, which is why preparing them in advance and teaching them how to manage difficult emotions are key.Advertisement
Teach them the importance of opinions: Teenage kids are likely to be curious. They have questions, ideas and opinions, however, most of them find it difficult to express. They may feel as though they’re overstepping, especially kids who are introverted. This is why parents must encourage kids to be outspoken, enthusiastic and fearless. Help your kids understand the importance of having an opinion, expressing it and enabling them to accept criticism.
Give them space early on in life: Setting boundaries is important. The earlier you do it, the better it is. As your child transitions into a teen, they’re likely to need more space, more independence and more freedom. Parents might not like the idea of letting their children go, but it is the only way to help them find themselves, carve their own identities and also learn responsibility.
Focus on the purpose: Ask open-ended questions to help adolescents begin to narrow and focus on their purpose. Energy goes where focus flows. Helping adolescents identify their main goals can direct much of their energy to those areas of their lives and reinforce their sense of self.
Encourage self-reflection: Adolescents need time and space to reflect on their experiences, feelings, and beliefs. Adults can encourage and model self-reflection by continuing to ask open-ended questions and providing a safe and supportive environment for adolescents to share their thoughts and feelings.Advertisement
Encourage positive self-talk through empathy: Adolescents need to develop a positive self-image and sense of self-worth. Adults can encourage this by modeling positive self-talk and reinforcing positive qualities and strengths in adolescents. This can also involve making adolescents more aware of any negative thought patterns they might have, and steering them towards the positive.
Understanding the Gen Z code: With the new hormonal changes in their bodies, teenagers tend to have crushes on their peers. Parents should teach them the pros and cons of dating, the need for resistance, the importance of a career, etc. the strict rules shouldn’t be set by one-liners like “because I said so, you have to follow”, “in this house dating isn’t allowed”, “you cannot interact with opposite gender”, etc.
Supporting adolescents in building a powerful self-identity requires a multifaceted approach that includes self-reflection, positive experiences and challenges, positive relationships with peers and adults, and challenging negative stereotypes and biases. By providing young people with the tools and resources they need to develop a strong sense of self, parents, teachers, and other adults can help adolescents navigate challenges and develop into confident and resilient adults.

Delayed milestone: Understanding torticollis in infants,"Written by Dr Gazala Khan
Torticollis is a condition characterised by a stiff neck that causes difficulty or pain when turning the head. In older children and adults, it can occur after sleeping in an awkward position. Babies may also be born with a stiff neck, but this type of torticollis is different and typically not painful. Congenital muscular torticollis is the specific type that affects infants, and most do not experience any discomfort from it. Simple changes in positioning or performing stretching exercises at home usually lead to improvement in the condition.
The cause of infant torticollis is not fully understood by doctors. It may occur due to the baby being cramped inside the uterus or being in an unusual position, such as the breech position where the baby’s buttocks face the birth canal. These situations can exert pressure on a baby’s sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle, a large muscle that runs on both sides of the neck from the back of the ears to the collarbone. Increased pressure on one side of the SCM can cause it to tighten, making it difficult for a baby to turn their neck. Signs and symptoms of infant torticollis typically manifest when babies are around 3-4 weeks old, including tilting their head in one direction (which may be difficult to notice in very young infants), having difficulty fully turning their head to follow you, experiencing breastfeeding challenges on one side (or preferring one breast only), and exerting extra effort to turn toward you during activities.Advertisement
The symptoms
Torticollis in infants can lead to the development of a flat spot on the head, known as positional plagiocephaly, due to prolonged lying in one direction. This may also result in unevenness in the neck, jaw, and face, as well as the formation of a small lump or knot in the neck muscles. However, these symptoms typically resolve as the torticollis improves. Diagnosis of infant torticollis involves a physical examination by a doctor to assess the range of motion of the baby’s head. Treatment for infant torticollis may involve learning neck stretching exercises from the doctor to perform at home. These exercises aim to loosen the tight sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle and strengthen its weaker counterpart on the other side, which is underutilized. In some cases, the physical therapist may be recommended for additional treatment. Following initiation of treatment, regular follow-up appointments with the doctor every 2-4 weeks are typically scheduled to monitor improvement in torticollis symptoms.

Here are some tips for helping your baby develop strong neck muscles at home
• Encourage your baby to turn their head in both directions, as this can help to relax tense neck muscles and strengthen the weaker ones.
• When it’s time for your baby to eat, try offering the bottle or breast in a way that encourages them to turn away from their preferred side.
• When putting your baby down for sleep, position them to face the wall. Since babies usually prefer looking out into the room, they will naturally turn away from the wall, which can help stretch the tight neck muscles.
• Always remember to place babies on their backs when putting them down to sleep to reduce the risk of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome).
• During playtime, use toys and sounds to capture your baby’s attention and encourage them to turn in both directions.
• Placing your baby on their tummy for short periods while they’re awake, also known as tummy time, is a valuable activity. This practice aids in the development of neck and shoulder muscles and prepares your baby for the crawling stage.

What we want our children to knowPremium Story,"A couple of years ago, I wrote a column on ‘What we want our parents to know’. I had stitched together words from young people living with mental health struggles and their appeal to their parents. I was amazed at the number of people who found resonance with the pain and plea in the sentiments. Sheba, a mother of a child living with suicidal thoughts, shared that one of the stories was a turning point in her life. A young girl implored her parents, “There are times when I have thoughts of hurting myself or even ending my life. I wish I could talk to you at those times without you going into a panic, crying or immediately calling up the psychiatrist. I know you worry about my safety, but can it not be the only thing we talk about?” and, “What I am going through is not a reflection of your parenting skills. So please stop beating yourself up by constantly talking about your ‘failure’ as that makes me think that you think the same about me. Depression is persistent in nagging me into believing that I have failed at life, and your words just make it a lot worse.”
I was very curious to know from Sheba, what in these words had struck a chord with her. She told me, “We are all locked in this idea that we are failing — we are failing at what society demands from us as parents, as children, as young people. We are not measuring up to whatever this idea of ‘good enough’ is and rather than seeing other’s pain, we are turning against each other and are more lonely than ever before.” Her words have stayed with me and so has her request, “Why don’t you write now on what we want our children to know? You might be surprised how similar the themes might be.” Her words and questions nudged me to set out to interview some parents I work with in therapy on what they would like their children to know:
I am so sorry for constantly pushing you to meet ridiculous social expectations and being harsh on you when you could not meet them. When you started withdrawing, not going to school or locking yourself in your room, I saw it as a reflection of my own inadequacy as a parent. Anger became our way of talking to each other. I lashed out at you and you lashed out at me. Maybe you thought, you were failing me and I definitely thought I was failing you.Advertisement
When I look back at all those years, I wonder when did I buy into this idea that parenting was all about making children fit in. When you shared with me that you were gay, I found it so hard to accept as I was so worried about what would others think. Somehow, I took my job as your father to all be about making you fit in society’s yardstick of normality. If there were one thing I would tell all parents then it would be this — when you are pushed to choose between social norms and children, always choose your child.’
I kept comparing myself to other mothers, and you to other children as if we were all in some kind of race and we were always falling behind. It made me imagine the worst-case scenarios, and predict a lifetime of failures and burden of unworthiness. It was so damaging to you, our relationship and to me. I am so sorry for messing it up.
Parenting is supposed to be about bringing up children but you have made me grow up and understand that no matter what happens to us, we always have a choice in the way we respond to hardships. I have seen you do that in so many ways. The way you get up and go to school on days when I know the ‘dark fog’ of depression makes it so difficult for you to even get out of bed. Though there are times it tries to silence you, you always speak up against injustice — whether it is about a child being bullied in school, patriarchy or even how the social structures of class, caste and religion divide all of us.
I am not sure when depression and anxiety started creeping into your life but I do know that I was not there to listen to you or to understand you in your worst days. I tried to dismiss it so often with, “If you try you can snap out of it,” and, “It’s all in your head.” But I hope you do know that I am really doing all I can to try to figure out how it shows up in your life and how much you have suffered. I hope you will forgive my ignorance one day.Advertisement
I am learning to not make any assumptions about you, and can I request that you do not make assumptions about me too? If I am checking on you in the middle of the night it’s because I want you to get your sleep. When I ask you to get off your phone it is because as a mother I get really concerned about the impact of social media on your mental health.

Everything You Need to Know About Stuttering/Stammering in ChildrenSign In to read,"What is stuttering(stammering) and what are its symptoms?
Stuttering is a disorder in which there is a disruption in the normal flow of speech. The child may present with one or more of the symptoms like:

repetitions of single or multiple sounds or words, 
prolongation of sounds, 
pauses during the speech, 
word substitutions and 
 non-verbal physical gestures or sighing.

Will stuttering resolve spontaneously?
Children experience a phase of dysfluency in speech during the time they learn to communicate verbally. During this period, they try to express themselves as fast as they can and search for words. This is known as developmental dysfluency and most children outgrow it. This is more apparent when the child has a lot to say, is under pressure or is excited. This is termed as ‘developmental dysfluency’. These children don’t need any treatment and overcome in a few weeks to months. However, in children above 5 years of age, with persistence of symptoms or increase with time, a diagnosis of stuttering should be considered.
What is the age of onset and what are the aggravating factors?
The age of onset of stuttering can be insidious or more sudden.   stuttering occurs in 5% of children and is 4 times more common in boys than girls. The risk of stuttering is three times higher when there is a first-degree relative with stuttering. 
Stress and anxiety can exacerbate stuttering. Initially, the child may not be aware of the symptoms. As the disorder progresses, the dysfluencies become frequent and interfering. At this stage, the child starts developing mechanisms to avoid stuttering and emotional responses. The child may have motor movements like 

twitching of facial muscles, 
tremors of the face or lips, 
eye blinks, 
fist clenching and breathing movements. 

Stuttering is often absent during singing, oral reading, and talking to pets.
What are the consequences of stuttering?



The child may avoid speaking and social gatherings and may develop anxiety, shame, low self-esteem and even depression. 




The academics and social communication of the child are affected. 


These children are also often victims of bullying, which further worsens their emotional state. 


Children who are aware of their stuttering often get stressed in their effort to hide it from others, which has a negative impact on their entire personality.

What are the conditions that may be associated with stuttering? 
 Stuttering can also be a part of a behavioural disorder such as 

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), 
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), 
Anxiety or conduct disorder and
 Learning disability. 

In such cases, a detailed medical evaluation and psychological assessment would be necessary. Stuttering may also be acquired when a child who otherwise spoke fluently starts stuttering. These children need a complete medical and psychological evaluation to rule out neurological conditions that may cause the stuttering.
When should we seek medical advice?
Consult a Developmental paediatrician and speech therapist in the following conditions;

In children above 5 years and


if stuttering persists beyond 4 weeks 
 if there is a positive family history or
 in cases where stuttering affects the child’s functioning. 

Also, Stuttering has to be differentiated from speech dysfluencies due to hearing impairment, Tourette’s disorder and side effects of certain medications.
Is stuttering treatable?
Treatment is effective when started early. Developmental Pediatrician assesses the development of the child and also screens for any associated neurodevelopmental conditions.
Treatment needs to be started when stuttering persists for more than 4 weeks. Treatment is based on the severity of stuttering. Treatment mainly involves speech and behavioural therapy. A speech therapist will plan the strategies based on the child’s severity. 
A few common Strategies and techniques used include:

Breathing techniques while speaking 
Relaxation techniques
Speaking slowly and in a relaxed manner  
Gradual building of confidence 
Behaviour strategies to overcome anxiety and fear
Electronic devices and Apps are now available to help people who stutter.

More than 80% of children with stuttering show remarkable improvement with timely and correct intervention in the form of speech and behaviour therapy.

The procrastination trap: How to recognise and overcome it in student lifeSign In to read,"Written by Pranay Chouhan
Procrastination is one such problem that every student faces today in their academic journey. While the negative impact of procrastination is widely acknowledged among students, the understanding of what it entails remains limited for many. Students often confuse the term procrastination with laziness but in truth, it is an active process where a student or an individual willingly chooses to do something else except for the task the student is assigned or should be doing. Some recent estimates show that around (80 to 95%) of college students engage in procrastination and around 50% procrastinate consistently and problematically. 
Reasons why students procrastinate
Exam Pressure: Most students find themselves procrastinating when exams are around the corner. According to a study by the Biomedical and Biotechnology Research Journal (BBRJ), around 38.8% of students procrastinate while they are studying for their board exams. Extreme stress, fear or anxiety can completely overwhelm and hijack a part of the brain (cerebral cortex) which is responsible for planning, learning and doing other activities. Advertisement
Not Knowing What to Begin With: Whenever an exam or an assignment is near many students get overwhelmed with the pressure and feel lost and don’t know where to start. This leads them to put off studying or the project until the deadline is so close that their worry about not knowing the “right” place to start is overshadowed by their fear of not having enough time to complete the work or study for it.
The Unwanted Distractions: Students getting distracted from their work is one of the most common types of problem which traps students into the loop of procrastination. Most of the common forms of distractions are social media, texts and messages and sometimes a student’s thoughts and doubts. 
How to overcome the procrastination trap
Work One Step at a Time
One of the biggest reasons why students procrastinate is having an overload of work which causes them to have severe stress and fear. To overcome this issue, take small steps, for example, if you have an exam coming up, tell yourself to sit and study just for 25 minutes and then take a short break. In the beginning, it might feel like hours but eventually, it will keep getting better. Further, breaking down work into small segments can help improve your performance. This technique of studying or doing tasks is also called the Pomodoro technique. 
Work When You Feel the Most ProductiveAdvertisement
To come out of the loop of procrastination knowing when you work the best is important. Whether you are studying for an exam or completing a task, connecting with it is extremely important. Unless and until you don’t connect with your work you will not be able to do it efficiently. Listen to your body and see when you are active the most and accordingly schedule all your tasks and study sessions. 
Overcome the Surrounding Distractions
With smartphones coming into play students get distracted very easily, leading to hours of procrastination. To overcome this, the first thing you can do is turn off unnecessary notifications when you sit to study. Constant alerts from social media, messaging apps, or email can interrupt your concentration and lead to procrastination. You can also opt for apps or features that temporarily block notifications.

The loop of procrastination is very common among school and college students. Different students procrastinate for different reasons which can often lead to worse grades or lower well-being. But by following the above tips a student can successfully create an environment which will support them to focus and concentrate better. Staying disciplined while studying not only enhances a student’s performance but also builds a valuable habit that will help them in future.

The new parent’s guide to coping with sleep deprivationSign In to read,"Written by Dr Sibasish Dey
For a majority of individuals, the welcoming of a new baby into their lives brings immense joy. However, one component of new parenthood that is frequently ignored is a considerable sleep debt. New parents may experience significant sleep deprivation due to their erratic sleep cycles, which may have a negative impact on their health. This involves a higher chance of developing a heart or kidney disease, depression, high blood pressure and chronic disorders.
Multiple feedings each night and staying awake into early morning hours can cause sleep deprivation in new parents. Inadequate sleep can also have a detrimental effect on emotions and possibly impair one’s capacity to parent. This is particularly pertinent for new parents who are managing the requirements of a baby while adjusting to everything that comes with new parenthood. Adults who are sleep deprived are more prone to accidents, making them risky around little ones. Additionally, it may lead to a continuous sense of fatigue and drowsiness during the day as well as a decrease in productivity.Advertisement
Prioritising a good night’s sleep is crucial for the energy needed to care for the newest addition to your family. It is essential to identify effective tactics for both you and the child. Every family member needs sufficient sleep to function well and handle their new caregiving responsibilities. As a new parent, navigating various sleep-related challenges is part of the journey and adopting healthy habits becomes crucial for self-care.
Setting aside time for yourself to get enough sleep provides you with the energy to take care of your newborn, so figuring out what works best for you and your child is critical.
Here are some tips to improve sleep hygiene for new parents:

Take a nap when the baby does: New parents will feel refreshed after taking a 20- to 30-minute nap during their baby’s nap time, without experiencing sleep inertia, which causes a foggy wake-up. New parents can lessen their stress by resting while their infant is asleep. Through this method, you can partially settle your debt for sleep. Due to internal biological clocks, it can be challenging at times, but this is an excellent opportunity to try to get some sleep.
Incorporate calming and recharging activities into your everyday routine: The activities you do during the day might affect you more than the activities you do right before or right after bed. To help you fall asleep faster establish an unwinding space and a dependable bedtime routine. Strategies for relaxation can help new parent doze off faster.Advertisement
Diagnosing sleep disorders: Most people can experience problems with sleeping as a result of stress and demanding schedules, and new parents frequently endure sleep deprivation. People need to get enough sleep, and if you think you may have a sleep disorder, it’s crucial to get diagnosed and treated as soon as possible. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is one such sleep disorder that has been connected to excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). The detrimental impacts of sleep disturbances might have additional harmful implications on health if they are not treated.
Manage your anxiety and nervousness: If you are stressed from the day, it may be difficult to fall asleep. Learn to regulate your thinking to avoid worrying about things over which you have no control. Examine your concerns to determine if they are reasonable, and then replace unreasonable anxieties with constructive ideas.
Balance the duties: Strike a balance between the duties so that neither parent is overworked, and both are caring for the child. Take turns taking care of your baby’s overnight needs, such as feedings, changing and comforting the baby. A little teamwork and responsibility sharing can go a long way towards getting some much-needed rest. Paying attention to overall health and wellness will help you sleep better.

The quality of sleep that new parents receive can be greatly impacted by caring for an infant or toddler, particularly in the initial months following birth. While taking care of oneself can be challenging when caring for a newborn, the need of obtaining enough sleep should not be undervalued. Getting enough sleep is one approach to take better care of your infant. It is possible to get the sleep you require after having a child by creating healthy sleep patterns.

Sex education and teens: How to talk to teens about sexSign In to read,"Written by Prakriti Poddar
Vague metaphors of birds and bees just aren’t going to cut it these days. Today, parents are competing with social media and the internet to be their child’s source of sex education. It’s crucial to normalise talking about sex at home to ensure your teen gets safe and accurate information. Positive discussions around intimacy can help your child accept sex as a healthy part of life instead of shrouding it in mystery.
Safe sex discussions are critical. However, the scope of sex education should also include cultivating positive and empowering attitudes towards sex, sexuality, and the body. Introduce your children to diverse gender and sexual orientations and encourage them to accept and celebrate others while exploring their own sexual identities and preferences. Children need to be taught that there’s nothing shameful about sex and masturbation and that it is normal as well as a safe sexual outlet. Additionally, it allows for self-exploration which is essential to healthy intimacy.Advertisement
Of course, all this can be easier said than done. Some parents may need to educate themselves first before teaching their children about sex. Expect some awkwardness but remember what’s at stake when engaging in these essential conversations.
Here are some simple tips to help you broach the subject with your child:
1. Start early: It’s never too early to start teaching your child about sex, sexuality, and bodies. You want your child to feel more comfortable talking about sex and ensure they get reliable and authentic information. It’s OK to explain things in an age-appropriate manner. For example, a six-year-old may be curious to know where babies come from. You can simply answer by saying, “From a small egg in the mother,” without going into complex details.
2. Welcome their questions: When children ask about sex, first, make them feel comfortable. Patiently hear them out, then answer their questions as honestly and authentically as you can. Keep the conversation going by asking them if they are satisfied with the answer or would like to ask more.
3. Use correct names for body parts: There’s a good reason why you should encourage your child to use correct names for reproductive parts of the body. Using a goofy substitute encourages opaqueness and even shame of certain body parts but saying “penis” or “vulva” helps children realise that it is healthy to talk about these organs. It also helps children communicate correctly with doctors and adds to their understanding of good and bad touch and establishing healthy boundaries.Advertisement
4. Don’t change the channel! Instead, use it as a cue to talk about sexual space, dynamics, and preferences with your child. Cringing at an intimate scene or changing the channel will reinforce the message that sex is dirty, secretive, or dangerous.
5. Affirm body curiosity: Touching and exploring their body is perfectly normal and healthy in children. In fact, research shows that it begins in the womb! This exploration shouldn’t be associated with shame. Without judging your child, allow them to explore their body but in a safe space, like at home. This will make children more comfortable with their bodies and pave the way for open communication as they get older.

The downside of delaying or not having the talk
1. Consumption of porn: If children don’t find parents willing to talk on the subject, their curiosity may lead them to sources like pornography for information, which can lead to harmful misconceptions about sex and relationships and a distorted view of positive sexuality.
2. Indulging in risky behaviours: Without proper guidance, children might feel ashamed or confused about their bodies and sexuality and may involve themselves in risky behaviours.Advertisement
3. Vulnerability to abuse: Children not taught about their bodies and boundaries may not recognize inappropriate behaviour or abuse.
4. Poor sexual health: If sex is taboo at home, children might struggle to discuss sexual health issues with parents and delay seeking help.
Understanding sexuality is critical for emotional and social development. While the recommendations work for most cases, each child – and parent – is different and may require a different approach to sex education. What remains unchanged, though, is the need for open communication between parents and children and positive attitudes towards sex and sexual health. Children should feel safe knowing their parents have their back, and they can ask them anything. This will help children stay safe, be body-positive, and have a healthy relationship with sex and sexuality.

Fostering positive mental health conversations with our childrenSign In to read,"Written by Neerja Birla
In my journey advocating for child mental health, I’ve come across a staggering statistic: nearly 1 in 5 children experience mental health issues. Yet, what’s more concerning is the lack of conversation around this. I recall a poignant instance with a young boy, whose silent struggle with anxiety was only alleviated when his parents initiated a heartfelt conversation. This story reflects the transformative power of open, empathetic dialogue. It’s with this understanding that I want to delve deeper into emotional intelligence and the therapeutic benefits of nature, two vital components of fostering positive mental health in our children.
The Imperative of Emotional Intelligence
Emotional intelligence (EQ) is a crucial skill for our children’s mental and emotional development. It’s not just about identifying emotions but understanding and managing them in a way that promotes healthy mental growth. By teaching our children to articulate and process their emotions, we’re equipping them with essential tools for handling life’s challenges. This process helps them develop empathy and resilience, setting the foundation for strong interpersonal relationships and emotional well-being.Advertisement
Cultivating Trust through Active Listening
Trust is fundamental in any relationship, especially between parents and children. Active listening is a key to building this trust. It goes beyond mere hearing; it’s about understanding, engaging, and responding to what our children communicate. This method of interaction assures children that their feelings are valid and important, encouraging them to share openly. Such an environment not only fosters mutual respect but also strengthens the emotional bond between parent and child.
Normalising the Spectrum of Emotions
One of the most significant steps in supporting children’s mental health is normalising all emotions. It’s essential for children to understand that feeling a range of emotions is a natural part of life. By acknowledging and accepting emotions like sadness, anger, and fear as normal, we help destigmatise mental health issues. This acceptance is key to developing healthy coping strategies and building emotional resilience from a young age.
Embracing the Healing Power of Nature

Nature offers an invaluable therapeutic resource. The act of connecting with the natural world has profound calming and restorative effects on mental health. Activities such as exploring a forest, gardening, or simply playing in a park provide a serene backdrop for children to unwind and rejuvenate. These experiences not only offer a respite from daily stress but also open doors to rich learning and bonding opportunities. By integrating nature into our children’s lives, we provide them with a nurturing environment for mental and emotional growth.

The mental health of our children is a pressing issue that requires our immediate attention. By fostering emotional intelligence, building trust through active listening, normalising all emotions, and harnessing the healing power of nature, we can create a supportive and nurturing environment for our children. These conversations and actions are not just beneficial; they are essential for the healthy development of our children’s minds and hearts. As parents, educators, and guardians, it’s our collective responsibility to ensure that our children grow up in a world where their mental well-being is prioritised and nurtured.Advertisement

How to help an introverted childSign In to read,"We live in a society that is geared towards extroversion. Estimates suggest that introverts make up at least 50 per cent of the population, but despite this, parents, and a large section of society, think being introverted is an oddity. We tend to think that children should be sociable and outgoing and if they turn out quieter than their friends, we worry that something is wrong. We want our children to have large groups of friends, to be included in activities with other children because we think that’s “normal” and that’s what a successful child looks like. We don’t want our kid to be the weird loner who likes hanging out by himself because that reflects badly on our parenting skills.
So, if our children, by some quirk of fate, happen to be introverts, we rush around in a panic trying to jump-start their social lives. We arrange playdates if they are toddlers, insist on inviting their friends and classmates over if they are teens and push them to join numerous clubs and groups in a bid to make them act more like extroverts.
Mistakes to Avoid When Raising an Introverted Child
Worrying about their lack of a big social circle
Often, parents get worried about an introverted child because the world can be such a competitive place. Both at school and at home, children who are more extroverted and confident are applauded more than the “quiet” ones. But being an introvert doesn’t mean you are dull. Introverts possess many amazing qualities, from the way they think deeply about things to the way they connect meaningfully with a few choice friends who “get them.”Advertisement
When they do speak up, telling them to keep quiet
Not surprisingly, introverted kids usually don’t talk much. But just because they tend to be quiet doesn’t mean they don’t have anything to say. Instead, they may not know how to say what they are feeling, and to whom. However, on the inside, they have loud and inquisitive minds. Telling them to keep quiet when they muster up the courage to speak will only kill their spirit.
Ignoring their questions
If an introverted child asks you something, it probably took them quite a while to muster up the courage to do it. So, if your introverted child has questions, listen. Do not jump to conclusions or react in an overtly dramatic manner.
Pushing them beyond their limits
Parents want the best for their children, and sometimes that means helping introverted kids step out of their comfort zones. But sometimes parents push their kids beyond their limits and pressure them into things that they are not comfortable doing. Every child is different. If your child is introverted, don’t expect him to happily approach strangers or lead a group. Similarly, don’t pressure them to go to parties, play with large groups of kids, or socialise to the point of exhaustion. And if you question why they won’t do these things, they may see it in a negative way and think something is wrong with them or that they lack something.
Not paying attentionAdvertisement
Introverted children sometimes refrain from expressing their thoughts and feelings because they think about them a lot before sharing them with anyone else. As a parent of an introverted child, watch out for changes you see in your child’s behaviour. They may not have the courage to speak up because their young brain may not be able to comprehend what exactly is happening. So, if they seem to withdraw more than usual or change their behaviour, it’s worth asking about.
Not accepting them for who they are
The best way to show your love and respect to someone is to accept them as they are. It doesn’t mean that you do not talk to them about their mistakes and how they can grow. It just means that you try to understand why they are doing the things they are doing. After all, every human being has their own reason for doing things.
Comparing them to other children
Nobody likes to be compared to someone else; it does no good to anyone, be it a child or a grownup. With introverted children, it can cause even more harm, as the world already tells them that they don’t measure up to the “extrovert ideal.” They may face issues regarding self-worth if they are compared to others and repeatedly told that they are not as good as other kids.
Assuming that it is their nature to always stay silent or aloneAdvertisement
Introverts prefer being alone, but that doesn’t mean they don’t need anyone. They choose people with whom they can open up to and have deep, meaningful conversations with. Your introverted child probably prefers having a close friend or two vs. being class president and being surrounded by several acquaintances, and that’s okay. But if you notice that your introverted child is unusually silent, seems lonely and is not even seeing their close friends, pay attention and gently ask if everything is alright.
Telling them not to overreact
Introverts tend to take small things quite seriously. When something hurts or upsets an introverted child, they may rush into their room, hide in a corner, or cry into a pillow. Everything matters to them, which usually may get overlooked by others. They have an eye for detail and tend to read between the lines and may get hurt over trivial things and words.
The words “introvert” and “extrovert” are used frequently and often misunderstood to imply that someone is shy or outgoing.The true essence behind introverted versus extroverted children refers to their personality preference specifically, the way the child spends and recharges their energy.
We need to keep in mind that children are constantly learning to understand themselves and their place in the world. While it may appear that a child might be an introvert or an extrovert, it is important not to label children or put them in a box. As they grow, their preferences may likely change.Advertisement

Paediatric vaccinations: A guide for parentsSign In to read,"Written by Dr Pradeep Suryawanshi
Ensuring the health and well-being of our children is every parent’s top priority. One critical aspect of this responsibility is making sure our children receive the necessary vaccinations to protect them from preventable diseases. Vaccination, indeed, is a vital component of a child’s healthcare, as it can help prevent serious illnesses and safeguard the health of the child and the community at large. In this guide, we will explore the importance of pediatric vaccinations and the two prominent immunization schedules followed in India: The National Immunization Schedule (NIS) and the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) Immunization Schedule.
The Significance of Timely Vaccination
Vaccination should precede the age at which a disease typically occurs. By administering vaccines, we can prepare a child’s immune system to recognise and combat specific pathogens without causing the actual disease. This preventive approach is crucial in safeguarding children against a range of diseases, some of which can have severe consequences.Advertisement
The IAP Schedule, endorsed by the Indian Academy of Paediatrics, lays out a comprehensive vaccination plan for children in India. Here are the key vaccinations recommended at different stages:

At Birth: BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin), OPV (Oral Polio Vaccine), Hepatitis B
6, 10, 14 Weeks: DTWP/DTaP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis/acellular Pertussis), IPV (Inactivated Polio Vaccine), Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b), Hepatitis B, Rotavirus, PCV (Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine)
6 Months, 7 Months: Influenza
6-9 Months: Typhoid
9 Months: MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella)
12 Months: Hepatitis A
15 Months: MMR-2, Varicella-1, PCV Booster
16-18 Months: DTwP/DTaP-B1, Hib-B1, IPV-B1
18-19 Months: Hepatitis A-2, Varicella-2
4-6 Years: DTwP/DTaP-B2, IPV-B2, MMR-3
10-12 Years: TdaP (Tetanus, Diphtheria, acellular Pertussis), HPV (Human Papillomavirus)
Yearly Influenza Vaccine in Monsoon Season (up to 5 years)

It is important to note that the vaccination schedule may vary based on factors such as disease prevalence, the availability of safe and effective vaccines, and logistical considerations.
Special Considerations for Immunocompromised Children
For children who are immunocompromised, additional doses of certain vaccines, such as the influenza vaccine during flu epidemics, may be necessary. In times of outbreaks of life-threatening infections like Japanese encephalitis, the Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine should be administered. It is essential to consult with a paediatrician for guidance tailored to the child’s specific health condition.
The Safety of Vaccinations

Vaccines are developed and approved for use in humans only after rigorous research, including animal studies and multiple phases of human trials. This stringent process ensures their safety and effectiveness. Vaccines generally have no serious side effects, but some children may experience minor side effects like fever, swelling, or pain at the injection site. These can be managed with symptomatic treatment and are far outweighed by the benefits of vaccination in preventing diseases.Advertisement
Keeping Track of Vaccinations
To ensure your child’s vaccination schedule is up to date, it is important to maintain the vaccination card provided by the hospital at the time of birth. Some hospitals also offer vaccination apps that provide timely reminders, making it easier for parents to stay on top of their child’s immunisation schedule.

Pediatric vaccinations are a vital component of child healthcare. They offer protection against potentially devastating diseases and safeguard the health of our children. By following the recommended vaccination schedules, parents can ensure that their children grow up healthy and free from preventable illnesses. Always consult with your paediatrician for guidance and to address any specific concerns related to your child’s vaccinations.

Increasing allergic cough among children: How can parents take careSign In to read,"Written by Dr Sunita Chhapola Shukla
A recent report by IQAir 2023 ranked Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata as 4th, 7th and 10th most polluted cities of the world. As per World Health Organization (WHO), 5 micrograms per cubic meter of PM2.5 concentration is considered ideal air quality. However, around 60% of the Indian population resides in places where PM2.5 particle concentrations are at least seven times higher than WHO recommendation. Moreover, with the onset of winter, the air quality falls drastically.
As the Air Quality Index (AQI) drops, there has been a spike in number of children complaining of respiratory issues. Health experts are observing 30 to 40% increase in breathing issues among children, as compared to last year. With morning smog and high pollution levels during festive season, the numbers are expected to touch a higher side in coming weeks. Among the complaints, allergic rhinitis, chronic cough and shortness of breath are quite prevalent among children these days. Allergic rhinitis causes irritation in nose, thus leading to sneezing, itching, runny nose among kids. Similarly, chronic cough could be due to infections or allergies causing wheezing, shortness of breath etc.Advertisement
Air pollution is detrimental to child’s overall health, since it not only affects their breathing and lungs, but also affects their immunity and growth. Long-term exposure to polluted air can also lead to bronchitis and long-term respiratory issues.
Factors:
Various factors contribute to the respiratory allergies among children. Genetics play an important role. Environmental factors like pollution, temperature, smog, eating habits and lifestyle etc. play a vital role.
We have also observed that nowadays children with such breathing issues and cough they do not get better even after 2-3 weeks of medication, which earlier was four to five days only. Pollution causes oxidative stress and triggers the inflammation in the lungs.
Hence, exposure to pollution should be avoided. Vulnerable age group like children, elderly, pregnant women should avoid indoor pollution like tobacco smoke, fumes, incense sticks, dhoop-sticks, mosquito coils etc. Not many know that indoor pollutants can also have a negative impact on lung health and hence people should be cautious of both- outdoor and indoor pollutants.
Precautions and treatment:
For parents, it is important to identify the triggers that leads to allergies, cough and breathing issues It is imperative to consult an allergy specialist, identify the allergens and treat it. The nasal sprays and inhalers should be used as recommended by the doctor. These medications directly reach the lungs and do not have any major side effects, as usually thought. Their continuous use does not cause any dependence or addiction.
Parents should also encourage their kids to play indoors and avoid polluted air as much as possible.Advertisement

Start young for everlasting smiles: Comprehensive dental care for toddlers and pre-schoolersSign In to read,"Written by Dr Vishwas Patil and Dr Sachin Shah
Tooth decay is a widespread issue affecting children, with multiple factors contributing to its development. Despite your best efforts to prioritise your child’s dental health, it can be disheartening to find them experiencing yet another cavity. Poor dental hygiene is also the gateway to a poor immune system, which may lead to inadequate growth in children during their most crucial development years. Parents and caregivers need to acknowledge and understand the causes of poor dental hygiene and how to prevent it.
Poor dental hygiene impacts self-confidence
Children usually commence their academic journeys by the age of 3 years when they are introduced to social interactions without their parents or caregivers. These initial years of social interaction determine the foundation of a toddler’s perception of themselves, where bad dental hygiene often results in deformed or discoloured front teeth due to Early Childhood Caries (ECC) and can even result in speech impediments, thereby affecting their overall personality as they grow up.Advertisement
Lack of awareness costs a lifetime of challenges
One of the most prevalent factors aggravating dental caries in children is the delayed response to initial dental check-ups, which should ideally be around the child’s first birthday. The lack of awareness among new parents and pre-existing taboos surrounding milk teeth and their impermanence are the main culprits behind inadequate attention to a child’s oral hygiene. Environmental factors like disregarding proper dental hygiene, incorporating brushing of teeth after the age of 2, and an extended period of bottle or breastfeeding have significant impacts on a child’s dental hygiene and may lead to dental caries.
“The influx and easy accessibility of sugar foods and drinks also greatly contribute to the accelerated decay of a child’s dental care. Dental clinics note a 20% spike in patients during festive seasons, suggestive of the excessive consumption of desserts and other sugary items. These factors massively impact a child’s dental hygiene that may lead to surgical procedures, further distressing children,” said Dr Vishwas Patil, Head Pediatric Dentistry, Surya Mother & Child Super Speciality Hospital, Pune.
Precautions and solutions for dental caries

“Precautions to prevent dental caries are simple yet effective and can help avoid dental caries. Parents must consult paediatric dentists at super-speciality hospitals around their child’s first birthday to better understand the dietary guidelines for their children and are also recommended to begin proper dental hygiene even before the child’s milk teeth erupt. Moreover, whenever a child needs extensive oral rehabilitation or surgical interventions, it is advised to get such procedures done at a Pediatric Super Speciality Hospital, as they are equipped with multi-modal care to treat children with special healthcare needs and ensure a safe and caring environment for the child under highest standards of clinical excellence,” explained Dr Sachin Shah, Director- Neonatal & Pediatric Intensive Care Services, Surya Mother & Child Super Speciality Hospital, Pune.
Professionally applied fluoride varnish and pit and fissure sealant treatment are used as initial preventive measures which may aid in reversing a cavity in its early stages. Crowns are used to restore and protect damaged or decayed teeth in children. They are made of a variety of materials, including stainless steel, resin-veneered stainless steel, zirconia and composite strips.Advertisement

Cyberbullying: What parents can do to helpSign In to read,"Written by Prakriti Poddar
In February 2023, a 14-year-old girl from Bayville, New Jersey, US, died by suicide after she was cyberbullied around a video that showed her being attacked in her school. In 2020, a 17-year-old boy in Gurugram died by suicide after he was mercilessly trolled and harassed online for a crime he didn’t commit.
The proliferation of internet and social media has been a double-edged sword for children. While on one hand it has democratized learning for millions, on the other it has exposed children to harmful and toxic behaviours such as cyberbullying.Advertisement
In a recent global survey by McAfee, 45% of the participating children in India said they were cyberbullied by a stranger, compared to the global average of 17%. The statistics are just as worrisome for the US where the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention data shows 14.9% of all adolescents have been cyberbullied and 13.6% have attempted suicide.
American Psychological Association defines bullying as “a form of aggressive behaviour in which someone intentionally and repeatedly causes another person injury or discomfort. Bullying can take the form of physical contact, words, or more subtle actions.”
This behaviour stems from a need to exert power. People who bully, often feel helpless or out of control in their personal lives and take out their frustration in a violent manner in the absence of healthy coping mechanisms. Witnessing violence at home can also lead to bullying.
When bullying moves online, it is referred to as cyberbullying. The McAfee survey defines cyberbullying as bullying that takes place over digital devices like cell phones, computers, and tablets. It can occur through SMS, text, and apps, or online in social media, forums, or gaming. Cyberbullying includes sending, posting, or sharing negative, harmful, false, or mean content about someone else and sharing personal or private information about someone else causing embarrassment or humiliation.Advertisement
Cyberbullying among children can be deeply personal, associated with shame and the child may not want to open up to parents about it or be able to process it. Therefore, it is up to the parents to be proactive in sensitising children about cyberbullying, protect them from it and be alert and on the lookout for any signs of distress among children that could be traced back to events of cyberbullying.
Here’s what parents can do to protect their children from getting cyberbullied:

Set healthy tech boundaries: This is important for parents to moderate what their child consumes and how much they consume as per their age. For example, pre-schoolers should use the internet for less than an hour each day, children between ages 6-10 can spend 1-2 hours a day, pre-teens that is children between ages 11-13 should be online for no more than 2-3 hours a day and teens for 2-4 hours a day. The time spent online by children should be balanced by the time spent playing or moving around and doing physical activity outdoors for their complete development. Empower your child to navigate the digital world wisely and shape their digital journey for success.
Educate them of cyberbullying: Make them aware of cyberbullying, privacy, and other online risks through your personal struggles or through stories in the public domain. Use these conversations to talk of what is okay and what is not online and what your child should do if they feel threatened or unsafe.
Create awareness around mental illness: Children struggling with mental health issues such as anxiety and depression often become targets for bullies. By talking of mental illness at home and sharing information about it you can destigmatize mental illness so that your child doesn’t feel in any way ‘weaker’ because of it. At the same time, seek professional help for your child. Positive attitudes and behaviours at home can contribute to the child’s confidence and build resilience.Advertisement
Encourage your child to communicate: Maintain an open channel of communication with your child. Encourage conversations around relationships at school and online activities. If the child suggests or insists on a potentially risky online activity or behaviour, talk to them, and explain why it is not safe.
Look for warning signs: An uptick in online activities or time spent on devices is a reason for you to check in with your child. If your child is acting withdrawn, isolated, and avoiding social situations it could indicate a case cyber bullying. If you sense something is wrong, talk to them and inform them that you will have to check their online activity because it is necessary and for their safety.
In case your child confides in you and says that they are getting cyberbullied, express your support and unconditional love for them and thank them for sharing this with you. If your child is older, you can together discuss the next course of action. It is important that parents react calmly and show their support and willingness to help. They need to acknowledge the pain and hurt caused by cyberbullying and strive to create a safe space to initiate their child’s healing process.

Love stories do not diePremium Story,"I got a call in the middle of the night that my father was no more. My husband and I left for my mountain town in the dark and reached home thronging with known and unknown faces. Teary, tender embraces soothed me a little, but it seemed to me as if I was stuck in a swamp. I was back home where I was born, and my father’s body was being prepared for the antim yatra with rituals at the very spot where my marriage rituals were held decades ago. The muddled voices of the priests did not make any sense to me until I heard them instruct someone to get my mother to make the parikrama of her beloved husband’s body and break her bangles on the arthi. Shaken out of my stupor, I spoke up and told the priest, “Nahi, aisa bilkul nahi hoga” (No, this will not happen at all). The priest, not used to being disregarded, and definitely not by a woman, told me that it was a parampara and only symbolised that their relationship was now over. I stood my ground and the rituals were completed but his words have kept painfully ricocheting in my head.
If personal is political then death is political, too. Patriarchy hurts and in times of pain, it adds to the anguish. A few years ago, a friend had shared with me about how after her father’s death she had felt more invisible than ever. It was her brothers, with the priests, who made the decisions and carried out the rituals where women were just expected to follow them without any questions. Any protest would be seen as degrading the parampara. “It was very confusing as I was dealing with the loss of my father and my position in the family at the same time.” What is it about death that silences us and robs us of values that we uphold so high otherwise?
Let me clarify that this is not to say that parampara does hold importance for me. We are who we are because of the cultural context we grow up in. It is our traditions, our heritage and our rituals that give us a sense of belonging, connection and continuity from one generation to another. After my father’s death, that is what sustained us. We heal in kinships and not in silos. Our family has been there for generations and our roots spread to many towns and villages near and far. People kept pouring in day after day. Subdued conversations would inevitably lead to laughter, tears, endless cups of tea and even more endless stories. Stories of my father that I had never heard before, made me get to know him in ways that I had never known before. It reminded me of Tagore’s song “Tomay notun kore pabo bole” – I lose you to find you again and again. As stories of past, present and possible future were being weaved, back and forth until what the Stoics called the chronos (sequential) time melted into aeon time – fluent looping back and forth gave way to a fascinating sense of timelessness and eternity.Advertisement
We make stories and stories make us. We make sense of this world through stories; they give our life meaning, and they give meaning to our death. Stories transcend death, love stories transcend generations and become legacies. And through stories of legacies, people live with us forever.
So yes, parampara is important but not sacred. It cannot be at the cost of the human spirit and connections; where it becomes a weapon for power play, oppression and alienating people because of their gender, caste, religion, class or sexuality. Then we need to stand up to it, in solidarity, and call it by its name. And no, my father’s death does not mean that my mother’s or my brother’s or my relationship with him has ended – it will transcend time and live with us and beyond us. Death robs us of a lot, but it can never take away our memories and our stories.
Because love does not die, relationships do not die, and love stories do not die
For that, we have to move away from prescriptive and normative ideas of grieving that promote discourses of “saying goodbye,” “ending relationships” and “moving on”. These are very dangerous ideas for people navigating their way in the face of death and loss. We have to find ways to craft our stories and show up for each other in ways that make us stronger and make our connection with the people who have passed on stronger too.Advertisement
If you are comfortable with it, I would like you to think of one significant being (human or animal) in your life who has died and who meant a lot to you:

What words or stories would you use to introduce them?
What favourite memories would you share that bring a smile to your face or warm your heart?
What did they appreciate about you that the others might have missed?
If you saw yourself through their loving eyes, what do you think it meant for them to have you in their life?
What stories about them would they want to be preserved and told to others?
What are some of the dreams and hopes you have for yourself that were made possible by your connection to them?
What sort of things did they teach you about life by their actions or just being who they were?
What are the ways you have learned to honour their lives through your actions?
What would it mean for them to know that you carry this legacy forward?

What memories we carry after a person’s death depends on the stories; we are going to craft together. My grandfather, my Dadu, died more than 20 years ago, but he is more alive to me than ever. He was a freedom fighter, a changemaker, a storyteller, and his stories nourished the soil that I stand on today and will continue to do so for generations. As Thich Nhat Hanh, Zen Buddhist teacher and peace activist put it, “All of us are interbeing: we are all connected. When I die, my body will turn to the soil, and that soil will nurture a sapling, and life will continue.”

Fun over grades: How a fresh approach to learning is producing supercharged studentsSign In to read,"Written by Dr Tristha Ramamurthy
What is the true purpose and measure of learning? Can learning be reduced to simply a grade at the end of a unit or a term? It’s time to deeply reflect on these questions, to take a step back and dissect this need to prioritise grades above all else. We can no longer reduce the success of students and educational institutions to a series of numbers and letters on a report card. This narrow focus overlooks the diverse intelligences and potential within each student. 
One way to disrupt this myopic view is to create immersive learning experiences that challenge students to step out of their comfort zones and engage with content on a deeper, more intuitive level. We must enrich the process of teaching and learning with dimensions that grades alone cannot capture. Advertisement
Immersive learning transforms classrooms into ecosystems of experimentation and exploration. Instead of solely writing reports on Shakespeare, students act out plays, embodying characters to explore complex narratives and language. Science lessons are augmented by students conducting experiments that allow them to witness the reactions they once only read about. Mathematics becomes a tool for solving puzzles and games that mimic real-life scenarios, making abstract concepts concrete. Such active engagement in learning processes not only solidifies understanding but also sparks a level of excitement and connection with the subject matter that traditional methods struggle to achieve. 
Teachers’ involvement is crucial in this evolutionary approach to learning. No longer mere purveyors of knowledge, they are now directors of a learning experience that mirrors the world beyond classroom walls. They curate content that goes beyond textbooks, incorporating real-world problems and interdisciplinary projects that foster higher-order thinking skills. Their role is crucial in creating a learning environment that is responsive and adaptive, where students’ ideas are met with enthusiasm and encouragement. A teacher’s passion is infectious, and when they model a love for learning, their students are likely to catch that fervour. 
What we observe in students exposed to such an educational paradigm is nothing short of remarkable. These learners are enlivened by their education; they don’t just study, they inquire and innovate. This enthusiasm translates to an amplified level of intellectual engagement, where learning becomes an intrinsic desire rather than an extrinsic requirement. The outcome is students who are not just ‘charged’ for academic challenges but are ‘supercharged’ with a passion for lifelong learning, equipped with the cognitive tools to approach the world with curiosity and confidence. 
With that said, I urge every educator to breathe life into their pedagogy. Integrate the joy of learning into the fabric of your curricula, and witness the classroom transform from a space of passive learning to a lively hub of active discovery. Let us commit to an educational journey that emphasises immersive, joyous learning as much as it does academic rigour. Advertisement

When students find joy in the learning process, they develop a robust love for education that transcends the classroom, preparing them to become not just successful students, but lifelong learners and innovators. This is not just a shift in teaching methodology; it’s a cultural shift in our approach to education—a shift towards creating a world of learners who are as passionate about acquiring knowledge as they are capable of achieving high grades, fostering an environment where the thirst for knowledge is unending and the learning process is celebrated as an adventure of the mind and spirit.

How to keep your child’s teeth healthy this festive seasonSign In to read,"Written by Dr Rajeev Chitguppi
The festive season is here, and as we celebrate with sweets and treats, it’s crucial to look out for our kids’ dental health. Here are some simple yet smart ways to make sure those little teeth stay cavity-free during this happy time:
1. Choose smart sweets: Quality matters
When picking sweets, go for the good stuff. For example, dark chocolate has less sugar and even has some good stuff for our bodies. Also, sweets made of nuts and dry fruits are a healthier option.
2. Snack smartly: Timing is keyAdvertisement
Snacking all day can hurt teeth. Reduce the frequency of snacking. Encourage regular meals and snacks to give the mouth a break. Try healthy snacks like fruits, veggies and cheese. They not only fill up hungry tummies but also keep teeth happy.
3. Water is the hero: Drink enough water!
Water is fantastic for teeth. After eating sweets, have your child drink plenty of water. It helps wash away the sugar and keeps teeth safe. Make it fun by adding a bit of mint or citrus flavour.
4. Water is the hero, yet again: Rinse well!
 Regular dental check-ups are a must. (Source: Freepik)
Teeth are covered with a thin, sticky film full of bacteria, which produces acid when exposed to sugar. It is this acid that causes cavities. Make sure the kids rinse their mouth well with water every time they eat something.
5. Brushing rule: Two minutes, twice a day
Brushing is a must, even when there are no festivities! Get your child to brush for two minutes, twice a day. Use toothpaste with fluoride – it’s like a shield for teeth. Play their favourite music or use colourful brushes to make brushing fun.
6. Teach the right brushing technique and monitorAdvertisement
Keep an eye on how your child brushes. Use small, circular motions and don’t forget the tongue and gums. Make sure they’re doing it right.
7. Regular dental check-up visits go a long way
Don’t forget to visit the dentist. Before the festivities kick in, make a trip to the dentist for a check-up. It’s like a health check for your child’s teeth. Early catch, early fix!

Brachial plexus birth injury: A comprehensive studySign In to read,"Brachial plexus birth injury (BPBI) or Erb’s palsy is a relatively uncommon injury (1 to 2 in every 1000 babies) that occurs to a newborn baby during the process of vaginal delivery. 
What is the Brachial Plexus? 
There are 5 main nerves that arise in the spinal cord and provide sensation and muscle power to the arm. These nerves then branch and interconnect with each other in a complex way. This network of nerves that supply the upper limb from the shoulder to the fingers is called the brachial plexus.  
What is the cause of brachial plexus birth injury? 
Prolonged and difficult labour along with larger baby size are the most common risk factors for brachial plexus injury at birth. Twin births, use of vacuum or forceps during delivery and breech delivery also increase the chances of developing this condition. 
What are the types of brachial plexus birth injury?
The severity of the injury varies according to the pattern of nerves affected and the type of injury to each nerve. The commonest pattern is affection of the upper 2 nerves of the brachial plexus (C5 and C6) called Erb’s Palsy. In around 20% of babies, all the 5 nerves are affected, called Total Plexus Involvement. Drooping of the eyelid may also be seen in children with total plexus involvement (Horner’s syndrome). In rare cases, the nerves controlling the chest muscles can be affected causing breathing difficulties after birth.
Nerves can be stretched, ruptured, or torn away from the spinal cord. In cases of a mild nerve stretch, complete recovery occurs within 6 to 8 weeks after birth. In case of more severe injuries, spontaneous recovery is less likely and surgery to reconnect the nerves may be required.
Even in children with good recovery of hand function in the early stages, difficulty in lifting the arm or eating with the hand can occur at an older age (3 – 4 years) due to an imbalance in the shoulder muscles.
How is brachial plexus birth injury diagnosed?
The paediatrician or obstetrician will usually be able to make the diagnosis by observation. Movements of the affected arm will be reduced or absent. Moving the arm may be painful if there are associated fractures of the collar bone. A thorough assessment is usually carried out at 4 weeks after birth. Specialised scoring systems are used to document the severity of the injury and the extent of recovery, if any. Specialised tests such as nerve conduction studies and MRI scans are required only in case of doubt or if surgery is being considered.
What is the treatment of brachial plexus birth injury?
In the first 6 weeks after birth, observation and simple exercises are the mainstay of treatment. Electrical stimulation of the nerves can be performed by physiotherapists with experience in managing babies. If there is poor recovery by 3 to 6 months of age, surgery to reconnect the affected nerves may be required. Nerve surgery provides good results only when performed in the first 12 months after birth. In older children who are unable to use the arm or shoulder, muscle release and tendon transfer surgery can be performed with good results. It is advisable for all children with brachial plexus injury to take up swimming, dancing and sports that strengthen the muscles of the arm and shoulder.
What is the prognosis following brachial plexus birth injury?
The good news for parents is that the vast majority of brachial plexus injuries in infants recover completely without any disability. A small proportion of children may require nerve surgery in the first 12 months of life, if there is lack of spontaneous recovery. Problems with arm or shoulder function can be corrected even in the older child. Consulting an expert in the management of brachial plexus birth injury soon after birth allows medical professionals to assess the condition properly, counsel the parents and start appropriate management at the earliest.

"As Indian cities are wrapped in smog, tips to protect your childSign In to read","Written by Dr Paula Goel
With the increasing level of smog and air pollution in cities, most parents are concerned about their child’s health. Smog is a harmful mixture of smoke and fog which can have a serious impact on a child’s respiratory health and overall well-being.
Smog is primarily composed of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ground-level ozone (O3), and various pollutants released from vehicles, industrial processes, and other sources. Long-term exposure to smog can cause a number of health problems such as:Advertisement
Respiratory Problems: Children are particularly vulnerable to smog’s effects because their lungs are still developing. Exposure to smog can exacerbate asthma, increase the risk of respiratory infections, and lead to decreased lung function over time.
Cardiovascular Issues: Smog can also harm the cardiovascular system & has been linked to heart attacks, stroke, and high blood pressure.
Developmental Delays: Long-term exposure to air pollution, including smog, has been associated with developmental delays and cognitive impairments in children.
Allergies: Smog can worsen allergy symptoms, making conditions like hay fever more challenging to manage.Advertisement
Here are a few practical tips for parents:
Monitoring Air Quality levels: Many weather apps and websites provide real-time air quality information. On days when pollution levels are high, consider limiting outdoor activities.
Stay Indoors on Poor Air Quality Days: When air quality is poor, especially during smoggy days, it’s best to keep your child indoors as much as possible. Create a safe and clean indoor environment to minimise exposure to outdoor pollutants.
Use Air Purifiers: Consider using HEPA air purifiers in your home, particularly in your child’s bedroom. These devices can help filter out harmful particulates and improve indoor air quality.
Proper Ventilation: Make sure there is enough ventilation in your house. Proper air circulation can help reduce indoor air pollutants.Advertisement
Reduce Outdoor Activities During Peak Pollution Hours: If your child participates in outdoor sports or activities, try to schedule them during times when pollution levels are lower, usually in the early morning or evening.
Use Masks When Necessary: If your child needs to be outdoors on poor air quality days, consider using N95 or N99 masks designed to filter out particulate matter. Make sure the mask fits properly and is comfortable for your child.
Teach your child to wash their hands and face thoroughly after being outdoors to remove any pollutants that may have settled on their skin.
A balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables can help support your child’s immune system and overall health. Have foods high in antioxidants, such as vitamin C and vitamin E, which may help mitigate the effects of air pollution.Advertisement
Stay engaged with local environmental organisations and advocate for policies aimed at reducing pollution in your city. Collective action can lead to cleaner air for everyone.
Schedule regular check-ups with your pediatrician: They can monitor your child’s respiratory health and provide guidance on managing any smog-related issues.
Protecting your child from the harmful effects of smog in polluted cities requires vigilance and proactive measures. Remember that every effort counts in ensuring your child grows up in a healthier and cleaner environment.

How to encourage children’s creativity through artSign In to read,"Written by Krish Nawal
Art is a powerful tool for encouraging children’s creativity. It allows them to express themselves in ways that other forms of communication cannot. When children create art, they are able to explore their imaginations, experiment with different materials and techniques, and develop their problem-solving skills.
Nurturing a child’s creativity through art is a journey of exploration, self-discovery, and growth. It’s a journey that helps them develop critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and emotional intelligence. By creating a supportive environment and fostering their creative spirit, we can empower children to express themselves, innovate, and find joy in the world of art.Advertisement
Here are some tips on how you can encourage children’s creativity through art:
● Provide access to art materials and supplies. This doesn’t mean you need to buy a lot of expensive art supplies. Even basic materials like paper, crayons, and markers can be used to create beautiful and creative works of art.
● Set aside time for art each day. Even if it’s just for 30 minutes, giving children a dedicated time each day to create art will show them that you value their creativity.
● Avoid giving instructions. Instead of telling children what to draw or paint, encourage them to explore their own ideas and express themselves freely.
● Praise their efforts, not just their finished products. It’s important to let children know that you appreciate their efforts, even if their finished products aren’t what you expected. This will help them to build confidence in their creativity.
● Display their artwork. Once your child has created a piece of art, take the time to display it somewhere where they will see it and be proud of it. This could be on the refrigerator, on a wall in their room, or even in a community art show.
Here are some specific art activities that you can do with your child to encourage their creativity:

● Open-ended art projects. These are projects that don’t have a specific right or wrong answer. Instead, they allow children to explore and experiment with different materials and techniques. Some examples of open-ended art projects include:
*Finger painting
*Collage making
*Playdough sculpting
*Watercolour painting
● Process art projects. These are projects that focus on the process of creating art, rather than the finished product. Some examples of process art projects include:
*Nature walks. Collect leaves, twigs, and other natural objects to use in art projects.
*Action painting: Give your child a piece of paper and some paint and let them move the paper around to create different effects.
*Process collage: Give your child a variety of different materials, such as paper, fabric, and leaves, and let them create a collage using only the materials.
● Art history projects. Exposing children to art history can help them to learn about different cultures and art styles. It can also inspire them to create their own unique works of art. Some examples of art history projects include:
*Visiting a museum. Take your child to a museum to see works of art from different cultures and time periods.
*Reading books about art. There are many great children’s books about art that can teach children about different artists and art styles.
Encouraging children’s creativity through art is one of the best things you can do for them. It will help them to develop their self-expression, problem-solving skills, and imagination. It will also give them a lifelong love of learning and creativity.Advertisement

Balancing academics and extracurricular activities for studentsSign In to read,"(Written by Pankaj Kumar Singh)
In the constant run of life, preschool is that time when children are constantly learning and growing. It is the foundation phase of life, and while academics are important, it is also important to equally give importance to extracurricular activities. In this article, we will understand the importance of balancing academics and extracurricular activities for preschool kids and some insights for parents and educators on how to create a positive and playful environment where these budding learners can learn.
Importance of Early Learning
Preschool is one of the most vital stages in a student’s learning process. The skills that they learn and develop at this age help them in the long run. The primary focus every parent or educator has is to instill a love for learning among their kids. Academics in the preschool include basic mathematics, science, art, etc. However, there is much more to a child’s development than what can be found within the confines of a classroom.Advertisement
Benefits of Extracurricular Activities
Extracurricular activities are important for every student no matter their age. It is seen as a fun and engaging way to help a child develop. Extracurricular activities can be of different forms such as dance, music, sports, arts and many more. They provide children with a chance to explore their interests, develop new skills, and socialize with their peers in a relaxed and non-academic setting.
Exploring of New Interest: Extracurricular activities can help a child explore a variety of hobbies and interests at an early age.
Building of Confidence: When a child starts gaining tiny success in extracurricular activities, it helps them boost confidence which in turn helps them get a positive impact on academics.
Enhancement of Social Skills: Extracurricular activities play a vital role for kids to enhance their social skills like interacting with peers, teamwork, cooperation and communication.
Balanced Development: While academics focus on cognitive development, extracurricular activities foster physical, emotional, and creative growth. They contribute to a more well-rounded education.
How to Find the Right Balance?

Finding the right way to balance academics and extracurricular activities can be overwhelming and when it’s for a preschool kid, it becomes a challenging task for parents and educators. Well, here are some tips that can help you:
Know Your Child: Understand your child’s interests and strengths. This will help you identify the most suitable extracurricular activities that align with your preferences.
Limit the Number of Activities: While offering a variety of activities is essential, it’s also important not to overload your child’s schedule. A few well-chosen activities will allow them to enjoy each one and focus on their academics.
Set Realistic Expectations: Ensure that both you and your child have realistic expectations about their participation in extracurricular activities. It’s important not to pressure them to excel in everything.
Create a Schedule: Develop a schedule that accommodates both academics and extracurricular activities. Consistency and routine are beneficial for young children.
Monitor Progress: Keep an eye on your child’s progress in both academics and extracurricular activities. This will help you make adjustments as needed to ensure a healthy balance.
Encourage Rest and Play: Allow your child to have downtime for unstructured play and relaxation. This time is just as vital for their development as structured activities.Advertisement
Tips for Parents and Educators
Often parents and educators who are supporting their preschoolers in balancing academics and extracurricular activities, often find it challenging. Therefore, here are some tips that you can follow to help your kids grasp this transitioning phase of their lives.
Communicate: Communicating with the teachers of your child can help everyone stay updated with the progress and also help if the kid is facing trouble.
Celebrate Achievements: Whether it’s an excellent school project or a remarkable performance in an extracurricular activity, celebrating your child’s achievements can encourage them to work better.
Supportive Environment: Creating a safe and supportive environment for kids can help them explore their creativity and pursue their passions and interests.
Encourage Time Management: Helping the kids learn the basics of time management in preschool will not just help them understand the importance of it but will also help them efficiently use their time in the long run.
Listen to the Kids: Whether you are a parent or an educator, listening to children is crucial. The timetable you have created for them if it feels too much for them and they are trying to tell you then be a little flexible or create alternative options.
Balancing academic and extracurricular activities for a preschooler can be exciting yet challenging. Preschool is the foundation upon which a child’s educational journey is built. It is that time of their lives when they begin to lay the groundwork for future learning. So, a harmonious balance between both education and activities will help them lead a successful life.

What is PTSD in teens and its probable triggersSign In to read,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disorder that develops in some people who have experienced a shocking, scary or dangerous event. A new study shows that close to one in every three teens has experienced PTSD symptoms as a result of the pandemic and its associated trauma. PTSD was once seen as something that only combat veterans and war refugees would struggle with, but new research shows that people of all ages can experience PTSD, even young children. Kids may develop PTSD in response to any one-time or repeated traumas that threaten their sense of
safety and security.
What Is PTSD in Teens?
PTSD can be caused by a wide range of traumatic experiences, ranging from accidents and natural disasters to the loss of a parent or other family member. A single traumatic event, such as a car accident or a violent incident, is known as “acute trauma.” Traumatic stress can last days, weeks or months following the event. A traumatic event is typically an event that results in or threatens death or injury. Moreover, experts define tragedy as an event or circumstance that creates intense distress or sadness.
Ongoing traumatic events, such as exposure to childhood abuse, domestic violence or gang violence, are called “chronic trauma.” Both acute and chronic trauma can lead to PTSD in teens. Moreover, children and teens can experience vicarious trauma , also known as secondary trauma, caused by indirect exposure to traumatic events via media, close friends or family members.
12 Common PTSD Symptoms in TeensAdvertisement
For stress to be considered PTSD, symptoms must last more than a month and be severe enough to interfere with daily functioning.
Symptoms include:
1. Flashbacks
2. Nightmares
3. Panic attacks
4. Confusion and inability to make decisions
5. Difficulty sleeping
6. Finding it hard to enjoy activities that were once pleasurable
7. Irritable or aggressive behaviour
8. Emotional numbness
9. Constantly feeling on edge
10. Avoiding people, places or situations that trigger memories of the traumatic event
11. Difficulty focusing
12. Suicidal thoughts
New statistics
The new study , published in the International Journal of Clinical Practice, measured mental health symptoms in 447 adolescents, using industry-accepted scales for anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Results showed that 28.5 per cent of the teens experienced moderate to high levels of PTSD. In addition, 28 per cent had anxiety symptoms and 37.6 per cent had depressive symptoms.
Impact of PTSD on relationships and day-to-day life
PTSD can affect a person’s ability to work, perform day-to-day activities or relate to their family and friends. A person with PTSD can often seem uninterested or distant as they try not to think or feel in order to block out painful memories. They may stop them from participating in family life or ignore offers of help. This can lead to
loved ones feeling shut out.Advertisement
It is important to remember that these behaviours are part of the problem. People with PTSD need the support of family and friends but may not understand what is happening to them or think that they need help.
When PTSD goes on for some time, it is not unusual for people to experience other mental health problems at the same time. In fact, up to 80 per cent of people who have long-standing PTSD develop additional problems – most commonly depression and anxiety. These may have developed directly in response to the traumatic event
or as a result of the effects of having PTSD.
Why do some traumatised children develop PTSD and others don’t?
A child’s risk of developing PTSD depends on several factors:Advertisement
 The perceived seriousness of the trauma
Children who develop PTSD after being bitten by a dog may recover more quickly than those who have been kidnapped or sexually abused. That said, each child’s experience is unique, and their reactions will vary.
 The frequency of the trauma
Children who have been traumatised over and over again may react very differently from those who experienced a single terrifying event.
 The child’s proximity to the trauma
Did bad things happen at home? Next door? At school? Or much farther away?
 Relationship with the victim
Kids who are direct victims of trauma may face much higher risks of developing PTSD than those who only witness traumatic events.
When to see a doctorAdvertisement
If you have disturbing thoughts and feelings about a traumatic event for more than a month, if they are severe or if you feel you’re having trouble getting your life back under control, talk to your doctor or a mental health professional. Getting treatment as soon as possible can help prevent PTSD symptoms from getting worse.
PTSD Help
Treatment for PTSD in teens can make all the difference. But sometimes stigma or fear can prevent a teen from asking for help. Therefore, parents and other adults need to monitor teens carefully after a traumatic event, as well as during a period of collective trauma. Teens suffering from PTSD need comprehensive and compassionate support in order to heal and move forward.

Parenting and nutrition: Promoting healthy eating habits for childrenSign In to read,"(Written by Dr Phani Madhuri)
Balanced nutrition is the basic building block of a child’s physical and mental development. Parents play a vital role in shaping children’s dietary habits early on, and it is important that they reinforce healthy challenges that will benefit throughout their lives.
Here are some guidelines you can follow for promoting healthy eating habits in your children:
Be a role model: Children often imitate the behaviour of those around, and parents are the primary role models. If parents consistently make healthy food choices, the children are more likely to do the same. Incorporate enthusiasm for fruits, vegetables, and other nutritious foods to enhance the appeal to children, encompassing not only the act of eating but also the manner in which food is handled.Advertisement
Create a positive eating environment: Mealtime should be a pleasant and pleasurable activity. Instead of making meals a battleground, create a pleasant, relaxed setting. Distractions such as television and technological gadgets should be avoided, and conversation at the dinner table should be encouraged.
Offer a variety of foods: From the initial years, expose the child to a range of foods. A diversified diet ensures that they get a wide range of nutrients. Experiment with different fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and dairy products. Encourage children to try new tastes and sensations, and don’t be disheartened by initial resistance. It may take several attempts for the child to establish a taste for a new dish.
Balance and Portion Control: Teach the child about balance and portion control. A balanced meal has carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats. Avoid overloading any one type of food. Use appropriate portion sizes, and be mindful of portion distortion, which can contribute to overeating.
Eat breakfast wisely: A healthy breakfast is an essential component of a child’s nutrition. Instead of sweet, processed snacks, serve fresh fruit, yogurt, or whole-grain crackers. Keep nutritious snacks on hand to avoid reaching for harmful options when hungry.Advertisement
Limit sugary and processed foods: Highly processed and sugary meals lack in nutritional content and can contribute to health problems such as obesity and tooth problems. While it’s fine to eat certain meals on occasion, they should be the exception rather than the rule. Encourage children to see gifts as something special rather than an everyday occurrence.
Involve the children: Involve children in meal planning and preparation. Let children pick out fruits and vegetables from the grocery store or help in the kitchen. When children have a hand in preparing food, they become more invested in what they eat.
Stay informed: As parents, it is essential to stay informed about current nutritional guidelines and recommendations for children. As children grow, their dietary needs may change, and being aware of these changes ensures providing the best possible nutrition.

Parenting tips for ADHD: Do’s and don’tsSign In to read,"(Written by Dr Amish Vora)
Raising a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a complex journey, demanding patience and understanding. Yet, with the right strategies and a supportive environment, it can also become a profoundly fulfilling experience, allowing both parent and child to grow and thrive together.
Here is a list of do’s and don’ts you can follow: 
Maintain Hope: Do not give up hope. Many children with mild to moderate ADHD will outgrow the condition as they grow older, leading fulfilling lives. Keep faith in your child’s potential.Advertisement
Stay Positive: Encourage a positive environment for your child. Avoid being overly negative, and encourage all family members to adopt a positive mindset. Treating your child as just another child with unique needs can significantly benefit their self-esteem.
Have Another Child: Do not stop family expansion because of a child’s ADHD. Siblings can help lessen the attention on the child with ADHD, which can ultimately benefit their emotional well-being.
Allow Mistakes: Understand that kids, including those with ADHD, are allowed to make mistakes. Providing some flexibility in your expectations is vital. Small errors are part of the learning process.
Model Control: If you find yourself losing control or becoming too aggressive with your child, take a break. Lead by example and show your child how to manage their emotions constructively.Advertisement
No Comparisons: Avoid comparing your child with ADHD to other children. Each child progresses at their own pace, and it’s essential to respect their individual journey.

Me Time for Parents: Ensure that both parents share the responsibilities of caring for a child with ADHD. This includes taking time for self-care, so you can recharge and support your child effectively.
Structured Activities: Engage your child in structured activities. Find sports or hobbies that align with their interests, such as athletics, swimming, or gymnastics. These activities can help channel their energy positively.
Structured Play Time: Implement both structured and non-structured playtimes. Structured play is crucial for children with ADHD to help them release excess energy. This activity should last for 60-90 minutes each day.Advertisement
Routine Mealtimes: Establish regular mealtimes and use these moments for meaningful communication with your child. Mealtimes are an opportunity for bonding and understanding your child’s feelings and thoughts.
Time-Out Zone: Create a time-out zone for your child as a consequence for undesirable behavior. The duration of the time-out should be age-appropriate and serve as a way for the child to cool down and reflect on their actions.
Behavioral Therapy: Be consistent in your approach to discipline. Make sure your child understands the consequences of their actions and is rewarded for good behavior.
Acceptance and Teamwork: Accept the diagnosis of ADHD and work as a team with healthcare professionals. Your pediatrician should be the central figure in your child’s care, ensuring effective communication among various specialists.Advertisement

How parents can ensure a secure and healthy environment for their growing childSign In to read,"(Written by Mynoo Maryel)
Parenting is a remarkable act of selfless service, driven by unconditional acceptance, love, and compassion. In today’s age of social media and constant distractions, it’s crucial for parents to create a secure and nurturing environment for their children. Here are ten simple yet empowering ways to ensure a safe and healthy space for the growth of your kids:
*Be a Co-Creator: Shift your parenting approach from command and control to co-creation with your child. This change in behavior fosters a sense of shared experiences and mutual joy rather than anxiety.Advertisement
*Quality Over Quantity: Focus on quality time spent with your child rather than the quantity. Engage in creative and enriching activities, such as co-creating games, encouraging storytelling, and planning special outings. These shared moments build strong bonds and can help limit the use of social media and gadgets.
*Encourage Open Conversations: Cultivate an open environment where free conversations are welcome within the family. This approach instills a lifelong love for learning, whether through successes, failures, or mistakes. Encourage discussions and collaborative problem-solving.
*Foster Resilience and Learning from Failure: Teach your child that failure is a steppingstone, a lesson in disguise. Create a communication channel where ‘failure’ is seen as an opportunity to learn and grow. This attitude helps them navigate the challenges of adulthood with confidence and grace.
*Establish Structure and Discipline: Lead by example when it comes to structured routines and discipline. Co-create rules and boundaries with your child, differentiating ‘No go’ areas, ‘Maybe areas,’ and ‘Negotiable areas.’ This early introduction to structure sets the foundation for discipline.Advertisement
*Nurture 7 Super Skills: As parents, nurture these 7 essential skills in both you and your child – Confidence, Creativity, Effort, Problem Solving, Dignity, Discernment, and Decisiveness. These skills form the basis for becoming compassionate, responsible, and contributing members of society.
*Encourage Creativity and Outdoor Activities: Promote creative games and outdoor activities. Simple exercises like sharing positive attributes within a group can significantly impact your child’s confidence and happiness.
*Avoid Emotional Blackmail: Eliminate emotional blackmail and passive-aggressive behaviors. Encourage direct communication and collaborative solutions instead.
*Avoid Comparisons and Embrace Sameness: Avoid comparing your child with others or highlighting differences. Instead, acknowledge what makes them unique and encourage collaboration.Advertisement
*Respond to Tantrums Maturely: When dealing with tantrums, respond in an adult manner rather than reacting with frustration. Be present with your child as they navigate their emotions. This reassures them that you’re always there to support and guide them through any situation.”

Successful pregnancy after 9 abortionsSign In to read,"The joy of motherhood cannot be described in words. It’s the feeling of holding your newborn baby in your arms for the first time.

There is no denial that today, fertility is a challenge that is faced by several couples. Having an abortion is in itself devastating for a couple and then to suffer this again and again can be extremely difficult to deal with and depressing.
Recently, Rainbow Children’s Hospital was successful in bringing happy smiles to the faces of a distraught couple who had the misfortune of suffering 9 abortions due to a unique blood condition called anti phospholipid antibody syndrome (APLA ) positivity. 
What is AntiPhospholipid Antibody Syndrome (APLA) 
This is an unusual condition in which there is a tendency to form blood clots in the blood vessels that supply the pregnancy thereby compromising on the oxygen, nutrition and blood supply going to the pregnancy resulting in poor fetal growth and demise. Initiating anti inflammatory and antithrombotic agents even before she planned her next pregnancy greatly helped achieve our goal.
Journey of the couple with the hospital
Patient, a 32 year old lady, visited the hospital in December last year. She was married for 7 years presented with a history of PCOD and recurrent pregnancy loss. She had 9 previous abortions in the first trimester (less than 8 weeks of pregnancy), as she was APLA positive and had poor outcomes in the past despite taking aspirin and LMWH after the second pregnancy loss.
The lady was given prenatal vitamins and HCQs 2 months before planning pregnancy. Ovulation induction was done and simultaneously ecosprin 75 mg and myoinositol and metformin combination given. She was provided with a good luteal phase support with dydrogesterone 10 mg 3 times a day till 20 weeks of pregnancy, vaginal micronized and injectable progesterone along with LMWH.
The doctor had to stop and restart ecosprin and LMWH several times as she had multiple episodes of bleeding soon after conception, and was even admitted twice to the hospital for heavy bleeding. However it was effectively managed and by 16th week she was on a steady dose of ecosprin 75 and LMWH 40 mg. Subsequent scan at 24 weeks showed small for gestational age baby that was improved through proper diet counselling and regular follow ups. Antenatal steroid prophylaxis for fetal lung maturity was given and LSCS done at 34th week for fetal tachycardia with 3 nuchal loops of cord around the neck and pain abdomen.
With the hospital’s constant efforts and the couple’s determination throughout their journey of these ups and downs, the doctor was able to deliver a healthy male baby of 2.08 kgs on 27/7/23.
Apart from properly evaluating her details, closely monitoring her symptoms and promptly managing her condition without any delays, what helped her a lot was also tele consultation as she had access to immediate medical care without having to travel from home to clinic in emergencies. In addition, educating the patient about emergency medicines that can be taken in such situations greatly helps in mitigating the problems.
It is important to seek professional help in these cases for optimal outcomes. The hospital and the team of doctors feel extremely grateful and blessed for having the opportunity to make a change. It’s moments like these that make their professional endeavours so worthwhile.

Childhood is political not innocentPremium Story,"“I am weird and socially inept.” “I do not fit in no matter how hard I try.” “People think I am a freak.” Behind these poignant words from children and young people, I have sensed a pain, a longing, a resignation. These are gentle, creative, loving human beings and yet grappling with a sense of living at the periphery and not really participating in the game of life.
Our society has fixed ideas on who belongs – grooves are prepared, and some children fit in marvellously, some have to be pushed and poked and there are some who just do not as they do not act like others, talk like others, perform like others – series of nots keep multiplying as they try to navigate the rigid normative pathways set out for them. These are children who are neurodivergent (Autism, ADHD, learning disabilities, etc.), diverse in terms of their gender, sexuality, body shape or living with a disability. The marginalisation magnifies further when they stand at the intersection of discrimination in terms of caste, religion and class. Childhood is not innocent, it is political.
The tragedy is that children are recruited into using society’s faulty lens for self- surveillance which might go something like this:
Internalising the problem – “I am the problem”Advertisement
Invisibilising the issues of social injustice – “I am to blame”
Isolating themselves – “I am unworthy, unlikeable, and I do not belong.”
Children are not passive recipients of these injustices – they are constantly responding, trying to protect themselves. But sometimes these responses can come at a huge cost for them as they direct all their energies to survive in an unsafe world.
Masking This is a term from the neurodivergence lexicon which can be best explained as efforts or attempts to camouflage or hide struggles. Soha described to me how she had learned to mask her autism in school by closely watching her peers, “I closely observe how they dress, laugh, walk, talk just like David Attenborough would do in the wild. And then I copy them so that I do not look different.” It might seem like a very helpful adaptive strategy, but it comes at a cost for the person, “exhaustion, people pleasing and pressure to be and act like someone I am not so I can fit in.” Imagine living in a different culture where we do not understand the customs or language, but we pretend to do so just to get a sense of belonging. How depleted and confused would we be at the end of each day? What would it do to our sense of worth and agency?Advertisement
Safeguarding Children’s behaviour always makes sense. Sajid had found anger and hitting out as a way to protect himself against ridicule and abuse directed at him for being gay. It has earned him the label of “bad behaviour” in school and constant reprimands that had fuelled the anger further. “Bad behaviour” is not a call for judgment but an opportunity for us to see what is implicit in the pain. Anger might hide the pain of not being seen, frustration as a testimony to seeking meaningful friendships, and hitting out as a way to safeguard themselves.
Hiding Rahil explained, “Being autistic is like being in a play and everyone knows their lines, but I am walking around with no script. So, I do whatever I can to hide.” And how did Rahil do that? By not speaking in class, not maintaining eye contact, and finding quiet corners in school to stay away from others until people started looking through him and barely remembering that he existed. And let’s not blame the autism for his struggles because it is not the autism that is causing him to invisiblise, but our rejection of people who do not fit our idea of “normal.”
We have to stand up to the dominant narratives around children which can cause so much pressure for them to conform as they are extremely dangerous. So rather than jumping to conclusions let’s stay curious. When we meet a child who is struggling let’s stay curious and ask, “What might he be masking?” “What might she be safeguarding?” “What might they be hiding from?”
I would like to clarify that this political drama has no villains so that we do not end up blaming parents or schools for this burden children have to carry. We are all indoctrinated into this dominant idea of a “normal child” and pushed to promote it. Even psychologists, psychiatrists and therapists can be recruited into this dangerous manufacturing of “good behaviour” and fixing children. Requests and referrals for “needs to act normal,” “get better grades,” flood our systems and unwittingly, we can become the teeth and claws of this dangerous beast.Advertisement
Every October 10, owing to World Mental Health Day, there is a lot of hoo-ha about building awareness, training more psychiatrists and psychologists to bridge the “treatment gap” and I always wonder how we are missing forests for the trees. Depression, anxiety, addiction etc. are just a way for children to respond to the world that does not find them palatable.
Step out to step in A young man I met recently shared with me, “I have abandoned the idea of being like everyone else. I am Shiv and I am neurodivergent. I am learning how to play the game – when to mask and when not to mask. Masking robs me of my conviction in myself and makes me think I am a fraud. I am learning to let it go. I choose to be happy, less ashamed of being a weirdo,
I accept it and I own it. I choose to be more active and surround myself with people who love me the way I am.” I could not think of a more powerful manifesto for self-advocacy than this. But it would be deeply unfair if we let advocacy be an individual responsibility. It is our collective obligation to build a world that respects diversity rather than reject or pathologises it. We need to ask ourselves how can we step out of practices that promote society’s normative judgements and instead acknowledge and support acts of resistance? How can we receive young people’s stories of suffering and yet engage them in ways that not only address their individual struggles but also invite their agency to stand up for social justice and take social action?
And most of all, how can we step in to be allies in the young people’s journey so that through this solidarity we can create a more just world?Advertisement

The importance of pre-conception care: Setting the stage for a healthy pregnancySign In to read,"(Written by Dr Duru Shah)
The journey to parenthood is a profound and life-altering experience, one that begins well before conception. While most of us focus on pregnancy and postnatal care, the critical period of pre-conception often gets overlooked. Pre-conception care is the period during which, besides planning a pregnancy, we need to optimise our health before becoming pregnant. This plays a pivotal role in ensuring a healthy pregnancy, minimising the risks to both you and the baby. It’s a time when important decisions and lifestyle choices can significantly impact the outcome of your pregnancy.
Pre-conception care is not a one-size-fits-all concept. Instead, it tailors medical and lifestyle advice to you and your needs, with the overarching goal of setting the stage for a healthy pregnancy.Advertisement
Here are some vital aspects of pre-conception care that deserve closer attention:
Health Optimisation and Risk Reduction: Pre-conception care provides the opportunity to assess and address existing medical conditions. By ensuring that chronic illnesses such as diabetes, anaemia, hypertension, thyroid or genetic disorders, etc. if present, are well-managed, in order to reduce the risk of complications during pregnancy. This emphasis on health optimisation of the mother sets the stage for a healthier pregnancy journey.
Nutritional Foundation: A well-balanced diet is a cornerstone of pre-conception care. Ensuring that the body is well-nourished before pregnancy even begins, has long term benefits. For instance, adequate intake of folic acid, a B-vitamin critical for fetal brain development, can significantly reduce the risk of defects in the brain and spinal cord. Having a good haemoglobin value i.e. correcting any anaemia should be done so that there is enough oxygen reaching the baby for excellent development of all organs. Besides, it helps the mother too.
Weight Management: Maintaining a healthy weight is a major aspect of pre-conception care. Both obesity and underweight conditions can lead to pregnancy complications and development of the baby. Both these situations can cause the development of chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, obesity, etc. in the baby during the adulthood of the baby.
Infection Prevention and Treatment: Pre-conception care includes screening for infections, particularly sexually transmitted diseases, which can be transmitted to the baby during pregnancy or childbirth. Early detection and appropriate treatment not only protect the mother but also safeguard the baby from potential harm. Good examples are to check if the mother has Hepatitis B, HIV, or Herpes etc. which can be transmitted to the baby through the placenta.Advertisement
Environmental Awareness: Environmental toxins, such as lead, pesticides, and certain chemicals, can pose risks to fetal development. Pre-conception care highlights the importance of identifying and minimising such exposures, ensuring that the environment is as safe as possible for the growing fetus. This proactive approach is essential in the modern world, where pollution and toxic substances are prevalent.
Mental Health: Pre-conception care recognises the significance of mental health. Stress and anxiety can affect fertility and pregnancy outcomes. Counselling and support provided during this phase can help individuals cope with any emotional challenges they may face, thereby improving their chances of conceiving and maintaining a healthy pregnancy.

Family Planning with Informed Decisions: Family planning is not just about contraception; it is also about making informed decisions regarding when to have children, how many to have, and how to space them. This ensures that pregnancies are intended and well-prepared for, reducing stress and enhancing the overall experience of parenthood.
Genetic Counseling and Risk Assessment: For couples with a family history of genetic disorders or those in high-risk groups, pre-conception care may include genetic counseling. This helps individuals understand their risk of passing on genetic conditions and explore options like genetic testing and assisted reproductive technologies, adding a layer of informed decision-making.Advertisement
Immunisation for Preventive Care: Ensuring that both partners are up-to-date on immunisations is crucial for pre-conception care. This includes vaccines such as rubella, which, if administered before pregnancy, can prevent congenital infections in the baby, highlighting the importance of preventive healthcare before conception. HPV vaccine is another important vaccine which should be ideally taken during adolescence, but if not, HPV testing can assist in knowing whether you are already infected. In that case you need to get evaluated before planning your pregnancy.
Smoking, Alcohol, and Substance Use Reduction: Addressing the harmful effects of smoking, alcohol, and drug use is a critical aspect of pre-conception care. This period provides support and resources for individuals looking to quit or reduce these behaviours, setting a healthier trajectory for both the parents and the unborn child. Smoking reduces fertility, alcohol and drug abuse affect the baby by creating abnormalities in the baby.
In conclusion, pre-conception care is a comprehensive and personalised approach to planning a baby that sets the stage for a healthy pregnancy. By visiting your gynaecologist at least 3 months before planning your pregnancy will help you to focus on your health, nutrition, weight management, screening for infections, environmental exposures, mental well-being, and family planning. It empowers couples to make informed choices and increase the likelihood of a successful and healthy pregnancy. By recognising the importance of pre-conception care, we are taking a proactive step towards ensuring the well-being of our future children and promoting healthier and happier families in the process.

How can parents address bullyingPremium Story,"Watching your child experience the physical and emotional pain of bullying or cyberbullying is heartbreaking. Some parents are unsure where to begin to help protect their children from bullying and violence. Others may not know if their children are victims, bystanders or even perpetrators of harmful behaviour.
Bullying is unwanted, aggressive behaviour among children that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The behaviour is repeated or has the potential to be repeated over time. Both kids, who are bullied and who bully others, may have serious, lasting problems.
Signs that may indicate that a child may be being bullied include missing belongings, unexplained injuries, and a limited number of friends. Symptoms experienced by victims of bullying may be physical, emotional, and behavioural. Examples of physical symptoms include those often associated with stress, such as headaches, stomach-aches, changes in appetite, bedwetting, dizziness, general aches and pains. Psychological symptoms often include irritability, anxiety, sadness, trouble sleeping, frequent nightmares, tiredness in the mornings, loneliness, helplessness, and feeling isolated. Victims of bullying may exhibit behavioural symptoms as well, including avoiding social situations, getting to school or work late, taking off more days, skipping school without telling parents, or even trying to retaliate against their tormentors. Their grades may decline and they may become self-destructive. For instance, running away from home, hurting themselves or contemplating suicide.Advertisement
Verbal bullying is saying or writing mean things. It includes:
o        Teasing
o        Name-calling
o        Inappropriate sexual comments
o        Taunting
o        Threatening to cause harm
Social bullying, sometimes referred to as relational bullying, involves hurting someone’s reputation or relationships. It includes:
o        Leaving someone out on purpose
o        Telling other children not to be friends with someone
o        Spreading rumours about someone
o        Embarrassing someone in public
Physical bullying involves hurting a person’s body or possessions. It includes:
o        Hitting/kicking/pinching
o        Spitting
o        Tripping/pushing
o        Taking or breaking someone’s things
o        Making mean or rude hand gesturesAdvertisement
How can I help prevent bullying in my child’s school?
The first step to keeping your child safe, whether in-person or online, is making sure they know the issue.

Educate your children about bullying. Once they know what bullying is, your children will be able to identify it more easily, whether it is happening to them or someone else.
Talk openly and frequently to your children. The more you talk to your children about bullying, the more comfortable they will be telling you if they see or experience it. Check in with your children daily and ask about their time at school and their activities online, inquiring not only about their classes and activities, but also about their feelings.
Help your child be a positive role model. There are three parties to bullying: the victim, the perpetrator, and the bystander. Even if children are not victims of bullying, they can prevent bullying by being inclusive, respectful and kind to their peers. If they witness bullying, they can stick up for the victim, offer support, and/or question bullying behaviours.
Help build your child’s self-confidence. Encourage your child to enrol in classes or join activities they love in your community. This will also help build confidence as well as a group of friends with shared interests.
Be a role model. Show your child how to treat other children and adults with kindness and respect by doing the same to the people around you, including speaking up when others are being mistreated. Children look to their parents as examples of how to behave, including what to post online.
Be part of their online experience. Familiarise yourself with the platforms your child uses, explain to your child how the online and the offline worlds are connected, and warn them about the different risks they’ll face online.

ALSO READ | How to tackle bullying and what are the conclusive signs if your child is at the receiving end
Bullying can be associated with significantly serious problems. Teens who bully are at greater risk for engaging in delinquent behaviours, including vandalism, as well as violence inside and outside of school. They are also at risk of substance abuse and dropping out of school. Victims of these behaviours also tend to develop or increase their severity of anxiety. Bullies and victims tend to experience depression more than their peers who have not been involved in bullying, which can lead to academic problems, frequent absences from school, loneliness, and social isolation. Research shows that bullies and their victims are also at risk for having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). People who were bullied as children are at risk for having less of a supportive social network during adulthood, and those who were bullies/victims during childhood may have poorer physical and financial health, more antisocial behaviour, and be more likely to become a young parent compared to bullies who have never been the victim of bullying.

Prenatal education offers an invaluable opportunity for expectant parentsPremium Story,"(Written by Kinjal Popat)
Prenatal education is the process of providing guidance and support to expectant parents during pregnancy. It prepares individuals or couples for childbirth and parenthood by offering information about healthcare, pregnancy, labor and delivery, nursing, postpartum care and baby care. It also includes the mother’s eating, reading, and recreational choices that affect the child’s physical and cerebral development. 
Today, doctors and hospitals encourage parents to opt for prenatal education via various channels, including online and offline classes, workshops, online resources, books, and consultations with healthcare providers to increase the chances of a healthy pregnancy and childbirth. Advertisement
Why should parents opt for it? 
Women undergo internal and external body changes during pregnancy, which may further lead to many health challenges like postpartum depression. Prenatal education provides parents with important information on the physical and emotional health and changes that occur throughout pregnancy, helping them understand the different phases of pregnancy, labor and childbirth. 
Furthermore, prenatal education prepares them for any complications that may arise during or post pregnancy. It allows parents to interact with healthcare providers, raise and seek solutions for their concerns, and acquire trust in their capacity to care for their infant. 
What are its benefits?

Prenatal education empowers expecting parents/individuals to be open and honest about raising a healthy child. It enables parents to make educated decisions and actively participate in prenatal care. Furthermore, prenatal education provides parents with vital skills and practices, such as adequate diet, exercise, and stress management, to ensure a healthy pregnancy. Prenatal education also helps reduce anxiety and increases physical and mental/emotional confidence by promoting a greater awareness of the changes in the body and mind throughout pregnancy. 
Potential drawbacks
The pressure to follow stringent norms and suggestions during pregnancy may severely influence expecting parents’ mental health. While it is an essential step during pregnancy, in many cases, prenatal education may not always be available and/or be an expensive affair for the expecting parents/individuals, making it less accessible than others. Advertisement
This can lead to variations in understanding and resources, as many expectants resort to consuming information through the internet and/or close friends and family, possibly leaving parents without the facts they need to make educated pregnancy decisions. Moreover, prenatal education can sometimes depict an unrealistic or one-size-fits-all approach, neglecting to meet each pregnancy’s specific needs and challenges.

Support your teen’s mental health and wellbeing with a holistic approachPremium Story,"(Written by Prakriti Poddar)
Adolescence can be an exciting but overwhelming time, marked by rapid change. Children’s bodies are transforming, and minds are expanding to make way for the eventual transition to adulthood. It is a phase defined by children redrawing personal boundaries, flexing their independence, and exploring new identities. All these changes are not easy for teenagers and can cause confusion and distress. Add a chaotic and unpredictable world to the mix, and we have trends of adolescent mental health steadily declining across the globe, leaving experts and parents deeply worried.
Our children need our help. Their mental health needs attention — from teachers, governments, educational institutions, and especially parents. Nurturing teen mental health requires a holistic, 360-degree approach to their overall health and wellbeing — body, mind, and spirit. It is as much about what they eat, the number of hours they sleep at night, and how much physical activity they get as it is about staying connected to them, helping them find their purpose, and understanding what lights them up. All these aspects contribute to their transformation into healthy, happy, and functional adults.Advertisement
Nurture Their Mental Wellbeing
Understanding the mind of a teenager begins with open communication. However, as teens assert their independence, communication with their parents can decline. This fractured connection can lead to greater stress and anxiety for teens struggling with mental health issues. Here are some simple ways for parents to bridge the gap and connect with their teens:
Be honest — tell them you are worried: Tell your child you can sense something is not OK, and you are worried. Avoid assuming or guessing what’s wrong. Instead, let them know that you are there to help and support them.
Listen to them. Respond, rather than react: The greatest gift we can give our children is our undivided attention. As parents and guardians, we need to learn to respond — not react — to children’s negative emotions and outbursts. This will encourage them to open and talk.
Stay connected: Strive to keep all channels of communication open with your teens. Let them know that you are there for them in case they want to talk. Encourage your teen to spend time with the family as it contributes to wellbeing. Researchers at Penn State University found that spending time with family, especially fathers, has important implications for adolescents’ psychological and social development.Advertisement
Talk about everything in a straightforward way: Parents should initiate honest and responsible conversations on topics such as sex and substance abuse. They can share their personal experiences and vulnerabilities to make the discussion more personal, authentic, and impactful. This will encourage children to make responsible choices and adopt healthy behaviours.
Enable their autonomy: Empower them to make their own decisions by arming them with information, showing them the implications of poor behaviour choices, and assuring them of the safety net of your love and emotional support.
Set realistic expectations: Parental expectations help teens understand their boundaries, keep them safe and hold them accountable for their actions. So, keep them realistic.
Support Their Physical Health

A healthy mind requires a healthy body. Teenage years are a time of tremendous growth and change. Children shoot up in height, their shoe size increases, many gain weight, and some shed baby weight. In fact, adolescence is the second-largest period of physical growth after infancy. Parents need to support this rapid growth with energy-dense and protein-rich foods and nutrients. Include plenty of protein from plant and animal sources — eggs, lentils, soy, beans, and seeds. Fill them up with complex carbs from whole grains and millets and include plenty of fruits and vegetables (ideal for a healthy snack) for vitamins, antioxidants, iron, and fibre. Choose locally grown and seasonal produce to maximize nutrition and encourage your teen to stay hydrated throughout the day.Advertisement
Getting adequate exercise is just as important for teens’ mental health as it is for their physical health. Gently push your teens to leave those screens behind and step outdoors for an invigorating jog, run, or brisk walk. Encourage them to participate in team sports for an added social boost. Parents can join them in these activities to keep their motivation high and help them stick to their routine.
Teens also need to get ample rest to support their rapid growth and development. Research shows that teens who don’t sleep well are more likely to struggle at school and face a risk of depression. Setting a bedtime routine, which can include a relaxing meditation or breathwork session, helps in getting good sleep. Playing sleep music or stories can also help teens sleep better.
Encourage Teens to Cultivate Social Connections
Having friends is critical to teenagers. They often spend hours talking to their friends on the phone and tend to prefer the company of their pals over their parents. It’s not a bad thing. Developing positive social relationships with peers provides teenagers with a sense of belonging and acceptance. It promotes their emotional wellbeing and helps them develop social and emotional skills for life. A study published in the Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology found that peer acceptance in early adolescence is also linked to better academic grades.
If a child struggles with forging connections, parents should support them in finding a social circle to avoid isolation. Studies have linked social isolation to anxiety and depression in teenagers and children.
Adolescence is the time when children are figuring out what they want to do and be. Parents should support their quest and motivate them to find a purpose in their lives. It could be to fight climate change, create sustainable technologies, work in public health, or develop an artistic talent. Research shows that having a purpose can lead to longevity and better health.Advertisement
ALSO READ | Handle teens with care: Understanding self-harm
Last but not least, parents need to teach children the core principles of being happy. Their growing minds need to learn to dissociate happiness from mindless consumption and chasing society-approved goals. Children need to be taught that true and lasting happiness comes from within. It comes from knowing that you are healthy in your body and mind, that you are contributing to your community and living in harmony with nature. This self-realization leads to lasting joy, contentment, and good health.

Traditional ways or modern route for your baby: A choice or concoction?Premium Story,"(Written by Pallavi Utagi)
Parenting comes with a multitude of choices and decisions, and one of the most debated topics is whether to follow traditional baby care practices or embrace modern methods. In the ongoing and often impassioned debate between traditional and modern practices for baby care, it’s worth reflecting upon the past. Back in the day, there may not have been any R&D, medical labs, or even good old Google to help mothers seek answers. Instead, there was a keen observation, collective knowledge, and natural wisdom.
But some of the pearls of wisdom from our seasoned elders may be a bit past their expiration date. Back in their day, they might have had to resort to these quirks due to a lack of options or information. But guess what? Things have changed dramatically and baby-raising “oopsies” from yesteryears may become a bygone thing. Here is how we can solve the debate once and for all!
Feeding: Breastfeeding vs. FormulaAdvertisement
The debate between breastfeeding and formula feeding has been ongoing for decades. While breastfeeding offers numerous health benefits for both mother and baby, formula feeding provides convenience and flexibility. Fortunately, modern parents can choose a balanced approach. Many mothers today opt for a combination of breastfeeding and formula feeding known as mixed feeding. This allows mothers to provide the best of both worlds, ensuring their baby receives essential nutrients while accommodating their own lifestyle and preferences.
Diapering

Diapering has always been a contentious topic when it comes to traditional vs. modern baby care. On one hand, there are hand stitched cloth nappies which have been used for generations, and on the other, there are disposable diapers, hailed for their convenience. However, there’s a middle ground. Cloth diapers from a reputed brand combine the ease of modern diapering with the benefits of traditional cloth. These diapers consist of three main components: a skin-friendly waterproof outer layer, a Dry Feel pad, and a Booster Pad. The result is a diaper that is not only eco-friendly and gentle on your baby’s skin but also incredibly convenient. Some of the diapers are designed to be reusable and washable as well!
Baby Food: Organic Ingredients vs. Store-Bought
When it comes to introducing solid foods to your baby, you have the option of homemade purees or store-bought baby food. While whole food cereal options have become a go-to staple for baby food, the ingredient list and nutritional facts are now the checkpoint for parents rather than the brand names. These days many brands are offering easy and ready-to-use options made with Indian traditionally advised grains like Ragi, millets, fox nuts etc. It’s all about balance.
Traditional Free Play vs. Early Learning Programs
In the realm of child development, it’s like deciding between letting your little one explore a beautiful garden at their own pace versus taking them on a guided tour. Traditional unstructured learning is akin to the organic, self-guided garden exploration, where children are free to wander and discover the flowers and butterflies as they wish. Conversely, early learning programs resemble the guided tour, providing a structured, educational approach with specific stops and information. Striking a balance means letting your child wander in the garden of curiosity while occasionally joining the guided tour for a more focused educational experience. It’s about nurturing their growth in a way that suits their blossoming minds. Advertisement

In the world of baby care, the traditional vs. modern debate may seem unending. However, parents today are fortunate to have access to the best of both worlds. Whether it’s diapering with cloth diapers or a balanced approach to feeding and other aspects of baby care, remember that you have the freedom to create a customized parenting journey that works best for you and your baby. Ultimately, it’s not about choosing between traditional ways or the modern route but finding the perfect concoction that suits your family’s needs and values.

Navigating single parenthood: How to tackle challenges of being a single parentPremium Story,"(Written by Dr Sachin Baliga)
Single parenting, a path often chosen in the wake of separation, divorce, or the loss of a spouse, presents a unique set of challenges that extend beyond the daily routines of parenting.
It is a journey marked by financial pressures, emotional turbulence, and psychological impact on both the parent and their child. In this article, we delve into the multifaceted challenges faced by single parents, shedding light on the financial burdens, emotional struggles, and the psychological well-being of both the parent and their offspring.
Financial problemsAdvertisement
Most modern nuclear families these days have both spouses working and thus have the benefit of having dual sources of income. Each spouse manages specific financial obligations and contributes to raising the family. With a single parent, one of the most common practical challenges that comes into picture is an increased financial burden.
There’s no harm in indulging yourself and your child every once in a while, but you might also have to ruthlessly cut on expenses that are unnecessary. Having an open discussion with your child about finances will also be required.
It’s very important to financially educate yourself so that you can start saving as early as you can. Savings is not just about keeping aside a part of your monthly income; it can also be an important source of secondary income through investments, stocks and so on.
Psychological issues in the single parent

In the aftermath of a separation/ divorce/ death of a spouse, the single parent can experience a lot of tumultuous emotions. This is brought on by the sudden absence of a support system, and a shoulder to lean on, the parent can go through a lot of negative emotions like loneliness, isolation and lack of confidence, and even feelings of guilt. Quite frequently, it’s also perpetrated by certain family members and the stereotypical society who can a problematic attitude towards single parents.Advertisement
Do not hesitate to talk to your friends and family, even though there might be an initial awkwardness and hesitancy about revealing them the details of your personal life.
It’s important that you take care of yourself and engage in activities that help you gain back your self-worth. When the parent feels nurtured, it naturally creates a healthy and nurturing atmosphere for the child as well. In case of severe emotional issues that affects your work, health and relationships, do not hesitate to talk to a mental health professional.
Psychological issues in children
Children of single parents are at a high risk of experiencing psychological issues due to a variety of reasons: lack of a parent (and quite often an authority figure), a messy divorce, stigma from society, problematic parenting.
This can not only affect their grades in school, but also affect their relationship with their parent and the way they in general look at relationships. They may even find it difficult to accept new relationships of their parent.Advertisement
Badmouthing your ex-partner in front of your child is never a good idea. As the child grows, it’s a good idea to discuss the realities of relationships in life. Seek help of your extended family so that they can provide good role models and a support system to balance the lack of a parent.
Wanting to raise your child like a friend sounds good on paper; but instilling discipline, accountability and empathy form an important part of raising children to become responsible adults. In case of behavioural problems, do not hesitate to approach a mental health professional.
Single parenting, while it comes with its own set of challenges, also offers opportunities for growth, resilience, and nurturing unique bonds with children.
Addressing financial difficulties, seeking emotional support, and ensuring the psychological well-being of both the parent and child are crucial steps in navigating this journey.Advertisement
By recognising the hurdles and proactively addressing them, single parents can create a stable and loving environment for their children to thrive despite the challenges they face.

13 tips for students to safeguard their mental healthPremium Story,"In our relentless pursuit of academic success and career prospects as students, we often overlook the importance of tending to our mental well-being. It’s easy to get caught up in the whirlwind of exams, assignments, and future aspirations, but the truth is that neglecting our mental health can have profound effects on our daily lives, especially when confronted with the pressures of academics, stress, and the responsibilities that come with them.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), statistics show that approximately 1 in 5 children face the challenges of a mental disorder every year.
However, it’s important to remember that not all mental health issues are entirely preventable. Yet, there are proactive measures we can take to nurture and safeguard our mental well-being, ensuring that we can flourish both academically and personally.Advertisement
To shed light on these crucial steps, Divya Sharma, a psychologist and the chief learning officer at MyPeegu, offers 13 invaluable tips. These insights are geared towards helping children and young adults fortify their mental health, allowing them to navigate the complexities of life’s demands while preserving their inner strength and balance.











01Establish a consistent routineCreate a daily schedule with regular sleep patterns, mealtimes, and study hours to provide a sense of stability.
02Practice relaxation techniquesLearn and utilise relaxation methods such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to reduce stress and foster calmness.
03Stay physically activeEngage in regular physical activities since exercise releases endorphins, which can enhance mood and reduce anxiety.
04Maintain a balanced dietConsume nutritious meals to nourish your body and mind, while minimising excessive caffeine and sugar intake, which can affect your mood negatively.
05Seek social supportConnect with friends and family members, as social support is crucial for mental well-being. Don't hesitate to confide in someone you trust about your feelings.
06Set realistic goalsBreak down your tasks into manageable goals, and celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small they may seem.
07Practice mindfulnessBe fully present in the moment, as mindfulness exercises can help reduce anxiety and enhance mental clarity.
08Limit screen timeReduce the time spent on social media and other screens, as excessive screen time can contribute to feelings of isolation and stress.
09Prioritise sleepAim for 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night, as quality sleep is essential for cognitive function and emotional well-being.
10Learn stress managementDevelop healthy coping mechanisms for stress, such as journaling, engaging in hobbies, or seeking support from a mental health professional.
11Don't fear failureUnderstand that setbacks and failures are a natural part of life. Learn from them and don’t be too hard on yourself.
12Seek professional helpIf you find it challenging to cope, don't hesitate to seek assistance from a psychologist or counselor who can offer tailored strategies for your situation.
13Practice self-compassionTreat yourself with kindness and understanding, especially during challenging times. Engage in self-compassion exercises to cultivate a positive self-view.

"How female sex hormones ‘rewire’ brain during pregnancy, prepare for motherhood, new study reveals","How female sex hormones ‘rewire’ the brain during pregnancy and prepare it for motherhood, scientists reveal by studying mice.
The hormones, oestrogen and progesterone, acted on certain specific neurons in the brain region associated with parenting by making them more sensitive and enriching their network, the researchers at the Francis Crick Institute, UK, observed. The hormones are majorly produced in the ovary and responsible for typical female sexual characteristics, including fertility.
In this brain region, called the medial preoptic area (MPOA) and located in the hypothalamus, oestrogen made the neurons or nerve cells more excitable, whereas progesterone enhanced the communication by adding more connections between these neurons, called synapses, the researchers found by analysing brain recordings.Advertisement
Further, the mice did not display maternal behaviour both during pregnancy and after giving birth, when the researchers prevented the sex hormones from impacting the MPOA neurons by desensitising the neurons.
This led the researchers to conclude that there is a critical period during pregnancy when these hormones take effect. They have published their findings of their study in the journal Science.
These changes in the brain effected by the sex hormones resulted in stronger and more selective responses to pups, the researchers said. They added that while some changes lasted for a month following birth, others seemed permanent, suggesting that pregnancy can lead to long-term rewiring of the female brain.
Previously, it was thought that hormones released at the time of giving birth were most crucial for the onset of maternal behaviour.Advertisement
However, earlier research also showed that rats giving birth by Caesarean section and virgin mice exposed to pregnancy hormones still displayed maternal behaviour, suggesting that hormonal changes during pregnancy may be more important, the researchers said.
“We think that these changes, often referred to as ‘baby brain’, cause a change in priority – virgin mice focus on mating, so don’t need to respond to other females’ pups, whereas mothers need to perform robust parental behaviour to ensure pup survival.
“What’s fascinating is that this switch doesn’t happen at birth – the brain is preparing much earlier for this big life change,” said Jonny Kohl, study author and Group Leader of the State-Dependent Neural Processing Laboratory at the Crick.
“We’ve demonstrated that there’s a window of plasticity in the brain to prepare for future behavioural challenges. These neurons receive a large number of inputs from elsewhere in the brain, so now we’re hoping to understand where this new information comes from,” said Rachida Ammari, postdoctoral fellow at the Crick, and co-first author.Advertisement

In humans too, the brain may be rewired similarly during pregnancy, as the same hormonal changes are expected to affect the same brain regions, which could influence parental behaviour along with environmental and social cues, the researchers said.

Take Time: Self-harm and how to get helpPremium Story,"What is self-harm?
Self-harm is when you injure yourself on purpose. Also known as no suicidal self-injury disorder, people who self-harm do things to hurt themselves but don’t want to cause death. They may injure themselves:

To help them cope
Some people self-harm because it feels good to them, to prove they can tolerate pain or to relieve negative feelings.
To direct emotion inward
Some people self-harm to punish or take out their anger on themselves.
To communicate with others that they are in distress or need support.

How do people with this disorder harm themselves?
Self-harm can take many forms. Some are more common than others, but all come with risks. Some of the most common self-harm behaviours include:Advertisement

Cutting with sharp objects to break through or injure skin.
Burning with something hot like cigarettes, matches or heated sharp objects, or with chemicals like household cleaning products.
Hitting with solid objects — like punching a wall — which can lead to impact injuries.
Scratching/rubbing that leads to skin damage.

What are the symptoms of no suicidal self-injury?
If you self-harm, you may try to hide it from those around you. You might wear long sleeves or pants to cover up, even if it’s hot outside. Or you might tell stories to explain your injuries as an accident. Even so, other people might notice the following symptoms of self-injury:

· Scabs or scars in a particular shape or cluster.
· Multiple burns in the same size or shape.
· Frequent accidents that lead to new scratches, bite marks, bruising or swelling.
· Issues with impulse control, like they just can’t stop scratching an area of skin.

How is it diagnosed?
Non-suicidal self-injury disorder can be difficult to diagnose. People who self-harm tend to hide their injuries and avoid talking about them. Healthcare providers don’t use a specific test to diagnose self-harm. Instead, they inspect injuries, looking for patterns and scars from previous self-harm. They ask questions about the medical and social history. They also talk with you about what’s going on in your life. They look for things that might add stress, like financial problems, a recent death in the family, trouble at school, bullying or a break-up.
How is self-harm treated?
If you see a healthcare provider about self-harm, they will first treat your injuries if needed. Longer term, they may recommend therapy and/or medications to help manage underlying mental health conditions and life stressors.
What are the possible risks of not treating self-harm?
Getting treatment for self-harm is important because it has several potential short- and long-term risks.Advertisement
· Medical complications. Self-harm behaviours can lead to infections, nerve damage and permanent and/or severe scarring. Sometimes, it can lead to severe injuries or death.
· Social problems. Self-harm can intentionally or unintentionally affect your relationships with family, friends or other loved ones. It can also affect how you feel in social settings like work or school.
· Worsening mental health. Self-harm can lead to feelings of shame, guilt or regret. You might worry about people noticing your injuries and go to great lengths to cover or hide injuries or scars.
· More severe injuries. Self-harm behaviours can often escalate. You might start to self-harm more frequently or your self-harm may become more severe.
· Suicide risk. Non-suicidal self-injury disorder doesn’t involve suicidal intent. But the risk of attempting or dying by suicide is much higher for people who self-harm.
Preventing first-time self-harm isn’t always possible, but seeking help from a mental healthcare provider can reduce the chances that someone will continue to self-harm. Part of why self-harm can be a coping mechanism is because of how your body processes and reacts to pain.
ALSO READ | Handle teens with care: Understanding self-harm
When your body encounters something that can damage it, nerve endings in the affected areas send emergency signals to your brain. One of the things your brain does in response to those signals is to release beta-endorphins. These chemicals trigger a domino effect that makes you feel better for a short time.

"‘Kidfluencers’ enrich families, but what are their ethics and what impact do they have on children?Premium Story","The rapid development of the digital era has given rise to various new phenomena, including kidfluencers.
This terminology refers to children – usually under the age of 16 – who become influencers on social media. They appear in interesting content such as photos, videos, or stories about their daily lives – from playing, eating, dressing, to activities that are appropriate for their age.
Like adult influencers, these children are also involved in promoting various brands and company products through their uploads or uploads to accounts in their names which are managed by their parents/guardians.Advertisement
In return, kidfluencers can get paid, get endorsements or free stuff , get involved in advertising campaigns, and even earn money from sales of the products they promote.
Social media opens up opportunities to make home videos into a very profitable business field. Watching the funny behaviour and cute faces of children milling about on social media also makes users happy.
However, the presence of kidfluencers should raise serious questions about the role of parents in protecting children’s rights from the impact of their activities in this new commercial space.
The blurring of the line between kidfluencers and child exploitation
Nowadays, influencers have entered a professional category and are coveted by many young people. In 2021, the global influencer market is estimated to be worth USD 13.8 billion (around IDR 206 trillion).Advertisement
However, what are the ethics of making children influencers ? A study in the United States (US) wrote that with social media monetization and income from sponsorships, kidfluencers are counted as children who work in the entertainment sector.
Based on Law no. 13 of 2003 concerning employment, the minimum age limit for workers in Indonesia is 18 years. Those who employ children under this age may be subject to sanctions.
As reported by Kompas.com , there are several exceptions that allow minors to make money. This includes light work for children aged 13-15 years, work to support the curriculum, or work that supports children’s interests and talents.
However, this exception also has its own rules. The work above, for example, must not interfere with the child’s education and physical and mental growth and development, can only be done for a maximum of three hours a day, and is strictly in accordance with the child’s abilities. Most importantly, the law requires that all these activities be strictly supervised by parents.Advertisement
The problem arises when there is wide open space for acts of child exploitation and many of us are so busy enjoying it that without realising it we become part of the problem behind this kidfluencer phenomenon.
Meanwhile, Hukumonline is of the opinion that because the basis for the work that children receive comes from contractual agreements or cooperation contracts, they are not subject to employment regulations. This is because according to the Civil Code, those under 21 years of age or who are not married are considered not yet adults and capable of entering into an agreement, this right is entirely in the hands of the parents.
However, Hukumonline made a note referring to the Human Rights Law and the Child Protection Law which underlines the importance of children having free time to play with peers and develop themselves as well as being protected from economic exploitation.
In the end, parents are the key figures in whether the childfluencer’s workload and ‘work’ environment is truly safe and free from exploitation. Parents have the right to make autonomous decisions in educating their children, so the production of social media content involving children is considered normal.Advertisement
However, what happens in someone’s household can escape the eyes of the law. Various cases of exploitation of kidfluencers have been discovered lately, including cases of child abuse committed by parenting vlogger from the US, Ruby Franke, which have become very popular recently.
The impact of child monetization on social media, the blurring of protection and law enforcement as well as the exposure of these children to the public certainly has its own impact.
First, there is the issue of privacy.
Kids who become kidfluencers often share most aspects of their personal lives on social media, from their routines to stories about their families. This poses a serious risk to children’s privacy and opens up opportunities for potential misuse of personal information.
Second, the problem of consumerism.
Kidfluencers are often active in promoting products and brands to their young audience. The impact is that children can be influenced by this promotion, possibly pushing them towards unhealthy consumption from an early age.Advertisement
Additionally, their limited understanding of the difference between promotional content and honest content can create a lack of clarity in terms of morals and ethics.
Third, related to children’s education.
Children who become kidfluencers may miss out on important learning experiences at school or in their daily lives. They may feel pressured by the demands of constantly creating engaging content, thereby sacrificing time for formal education and healthy social interactions.
Fourth, child growth and development.
Intense exposure to social media can affect children’s mental health. They may feel pressured to maintain a perfect image on social media, and this can interfere with their identity development.
The role of parents
 This terminology refers to children – usually under the age of 16 – who become influencers on social media. (Source: Freepik)
For parents who want their children to become influencers, it is important to carefully consider the following suggestions.Advertisement
Firstly, it is very important to ensure that children’s formal education remains a top priority. Parents can help by setting a regular study schedule, providing assistance when needed, and communicating openly with teachers or school staff to monitor their child’s academic progress. By keeping formal education as a foundation, children will have a strong foundation for their future, both as influencers and in any other career they may choose.
Second, parents must be actively involved in their children’s online activities. Parents also need to ensure that their children’s interactions in cyberspace occur in a safe environment. Additionally, safeguarding children’s online activities is an important task, as is helping them understand the importance of setting privacy settings on their social media accounts and talking about what personal information should not be shared. With proper involvement, children can carry out social media activities more safely and responsibly.
Third, parents should not only support children in using social media but also teach positive values, ethics and responsibility in using social media. They must guide children to understand the positive and negative impacts of the platform.
Fourth, parents must also be a good example in using social media. Remember that children tend to imitate their parents’ behaviour, so it is important to demonstrate healthy and ethical use of social media.Advertisement
Fifth, if a child gets an offer to partner with a brand or company, it is very important for parents to check the deal thoroughly. Make sure that the agreement is in line with family values ??and does not compromise the child’s safety and well-being.
In the end, being a kidfluencer is not just a matter of making a profit. Parents need to see the value behind pursuing these activities for their children. With the right support, children can undertake their journey as kidfluencers with responsibility and a healthy balance without having to sacrifice their lives as individuals who are still hungry for a social life.

43 lakh children in anganwadi centres identified as obese or overweight: Official data,"More than 43 lakh children in the 0-5 age group were identified as obese or overweight last month, accounting for around six per cent of the total children surveyed at anganwadi centres across the country, according to official data.
The data collected from the government-run rural childcare centres also showed that the percentage of obese or overweight children was almost the same as that of severely and moderately malnourished children found in anganwadis — six per cent.
Out of the 7,24,56,458 children “measured” in the 0-5 years age category, approximately six per cent or 43,47,387 children, were classified as obese or overweight, showed the data collated from growth monitoring app ‘Poshan Tracker’.Advertisement
Thirteen states and union territories, including Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, and West Bengal, exhibit obesity rates surpassing the national average of six per cent, it showed.
Childhood obesity has exhibited a concerning upward trend in recent years.
There has been a notable increase in the percentage of children under five years of age who are overweight in NFHS-5 compared to NFHS-4, according to data from the NHFS-4 (2015-16) and the NFHS-5 (2019-21).
Before the ‘Poshan Tracker’, started in 2021, data was collected under the National Family Health Survey (NFHS).Advertisement
In the NFHS-5, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir recorded the highest percentages of overweight children under five years of age, followed closely by Sikkim and Tripura. In contrast, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh reported the lowest percentages of overweight children under five years of age.
Every state, except Tamil Nadu and Goa, has witnessed an increase in the percentage of overweight children under five years of age in the NFHS-5 when compared to the NFHS-4, according to data from the surveys.
A global study published by the World Obesity Federation recently showed that childhood obesity is a grave concern worldwide, and India is no exception. The study warned that if not addressed promptly, childhood obesity in India could see an annual rise of 9.1 per cent by 2035.
The study pointed out that the risk of obesity for boys in India may surge from three per cent in 2020 to 12 per cent within the next 12 years. For girls, the risk, which was at two per cent in 2020, may rise to seven per cent over the same period.Advertisement
It also estimated that around 11 per cent of the Indian population will be obese by 2035, with an annual increase in adult obesity projected to be around 5.2 per cent between 2020 and 2035.
The study suggested that continued failure to address and manage obesity could result in a global economic impact of USD 4.32 trillion by 2035, equivalent to nearly three per cent of the global GDP. The report indicated that the likely impact on India’s national GDP will be close to 1.8 per cent.
CEO of child rights organisation CRY Puja Marwaha has identified several key factors contributing to rising childhood obesity in India and these include shifting to unbalanced diets, increased consumption of highly processed and packaged foods and sedentary lifestyle that limits the burning of excess calories.
She also underscored the shift in children’s dietary patterns, especially in urban and semi-urban settings.Advertisement
Marwaha noted that the purchase of marketed snacks is increasingly influenced by children’s preferences, leading them to consume fast foods and sugary drinks, accumulating empty calories that their sedentary lifestyle do not allow them to burn off.
Highlighting another major contributor to dietary imbalance, she said that micronutrients are disappearing from the diet of the poor as traditional kitchen gardens are replaced by cash crops in villages.
She stressed that the cost of nutritious vegetables, fruits, and protein sources has become unaffordable for many low-income families.
When asked about how to tackle obesity, Marwaha said like other behavioral issues among children, addressing childhood obesity must begin with proper parenting. Raising awareness among parents about what constitutes a balanced diet is crucial, she added.Advertisement
Marwaha pointed out that in urban areas, children often consume minimal fresh vegetables and fruits, and working parents may resort to offering junk food to ensure proper behaviour in their absence.
This trend is not limited to urban areas, as even in rural settings, where both parents work as daily wage earners, children are sometimes given inexpensive packets of potato chips for lunch, she said.
Dr Jyoti Kapoor, founder and director of Manasthali, said obese children face an elevated risk of developing various health problems, including Type-2 diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and sleep apnea. These conditions can have both immediate and long-term consequences on a child’s quality of life and life expectancy.

Kapoor noted that childhood obesity often persists into adulthood, further increasing the risk of chronic health conditions and early mortality.Advertisement

Child abuse may be reduced in safer communities: Study,"Researchers have long suspected that a child’s neighbourhood can be a source of risk or safety. This notion is supported by a new Rutgers study, which discovered that when parents feel anxious or depressed about their environment, they may have a more difficult time caring for their children.
To get the best outcomes for kids and to elicit the best parenting, families need a safe, stable, stimulating environment, both at home and in the surrounding community, said Katherine Marcal, an assistant professor at the Rutgers School of Social Work and coauthor of the study published in the journal Child Abuse & Neglect.
But if you live in a neighbourhood where you can’t go outside, can’t go to a park or can’t walk down the sidewalk because there are drug dealers or trash, then families are cooped up in stressful conditions. This stress can make maltreatment more likely to occur. Most previous work has focused only on residents’ views of neighbourhood quality and safety. By examining both parent and outsider perspectives, the researchers were able to substantiate a link between neighbourhood disorder and child maltreatment. Using data from the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a longitudinal birth cohort study of children born in large United States cities between 1998 and 2000, Marcal and colleagues sought to assess the link between neighbourhood conditions at child aged 3 and child maltreatment at age 5.Advertisement
As part of the well-being study, mothers reported on how often they encountered drug activity, gang violence and other dangerous elements in their community. Answers ranged from never to frequently. In the same study, outsiders recorded physical qualities such as vacant buildings, abandoned cars, trash and other signs of physical deterioration in the neighbourhoods where mothers lived.
Marcal and her colleagues then assessed the relationship between these neighbourhood factors with subsequent child maltreatment behaviours.
The researchers found that resident and outsider perceptions of neighbourhood disorder were independently related to the likelihood of physical abuse. Additionally, resident perceptions of neighbourhood disorder were associated with a greater likelihood of psychological abuse.
The findings have significant implications for child welfare strategies, Marcal said. Improving the built environment, reducing poverty and providing adequate housing and housing services could help reduce maltreatment risks in low-income communities, the researchers wrote.Advertisement

We’re definitely gaining a better understanding of how stress and hardship affects behaviours, said Marcal. Child abuse isn’t just a simple matter of bad people being bad parents.

Returning home for vacations may help bilingual children retain their family’s native language: Study,"It is difficult to keep a language alive in the family. Many people who relocate to new nations discover that their native language has become a heritage language, passed down to subsequent generations with variable degrees of success. These languages face pressure from the dominant language in a country, as well as a lack of practice opportunities and fluent speakers to practise with. So, how do children use or maintain heritage languages? Can visits to their parents’ places of origin help them improve their fluency? The role of parental language use in the country of residence is well-established, said Prof Vicky Chondrogianni of the University of Edinburgh and Dr Evangelia Daskalaki of the University of Alberta, authors of the study in Frontiers in Language Science. Here we show how the opportunities to use the heritage language outside the home, and specifically in the country of origin, can help with language maintenance.
To understand how fluency changes over generations and how it can be boosted, Chondrogianni and Daskalaki recruited 58 children living in the US and Canada, who were bilingual in Greek and English. They were divided into three groups: the children of first-generation immigrants, the children of second-generation immigrants, and children who had one parent who was a first-generation immigrant and one who was a second-generation immigrant. All children attended mainstream school in English and took additional classes in Greek.
First, the researchers interviewed the parents to understand the background to the children bilingualism: when they had been exposed to Greek and English, how much Greek was spoken at home, and how often they visited Greece or were visited by relatives. All the children had been primarily exposed to Greek at an early age, and exposure to English largely coincided with the start of mainstream schooling. Early exposure to a heritage language and late exposure to the dominant language is linked to more complete acquisition of the heritage language, as is heritage language richness: exposure to more and different sources of the language.Advertisement
Spelling it out
Chondrogianni and Daskalaki carried out tests that targeted different aspects of the children’s language skills. They asked the children to name objects in pictures, which tested their vocabulary, and to describe events taking place in different pictures. This second test had been arranged so that the correct responses required a specific grammatical structure.
They found that the children of first-generation parents, and the children who had one first- and one second-generation parent, performed similarly on all the tests. However, there was a major gap between their performance and that of the children of second-generation parents, who were much less accurate.
Using the language at home improved outcomes in general, while visiting Greece and therefore being exposed to a greater variety of contexts and speakers supported particularly vulnerable aspects of language use, like vocabulary. It also helped with the correct reproduction of grammatical structures in a sentence. Increasing use of and exposure to the heritage language was linked to more accurate use of the language. The children of second-generation parents used Greek less, had a less rich exposure to the language, and visited Greece less frequently.

It is not just about using the heritage language at home, said Chondrogianni. It is also about the opportunities a child has to use their heritage language in different registers, contexts, and with a variety of speakers. Of course, visits to or visits from the country of origin might not be an option for every family, added Daskalaki. There are various financial and practical difficulties, and depending on the community, there may be geographical or even political barriers. Policymakers and community members need to think, creatively and collaboratively, how they can re-create this immersive experience in the country of residence.Advertisement

Creating an audience for every childPremium Story,"A few years ago, I started visiting schools as part of research for one of my books. I would sit quietly and observe children in classrooms, playgrounds, dining halls and various nooks and corners as they went about their lives. I learned more about children in those months than I ever could have, reading any textbooks or any of the degrees I have acquired over the years. I saw how power and privilege play out in schools, who gets to be seen, whose voices are heard and who are left invisible. I remember one of the classes where a teacher made me sit next to a little boy whom she had earlier described as having “special needs.”
This little boy’s hand would shoot up every time the teacher asked a question and every time it was ignored, with not even a look in his direction, as the teacher went about responding to the louder voices in the classroom. After the class was over, I tentatively reached out my hand for a high five with him, and the same hand shot out at me with the most gleeful look on his face. As I walked away, I wondered what words I could find to describe what I had witnessed — persistence, hope, courage? To me, that hand in the air was symbolic of a quiet determination to be seen and to be heard. But what would happen as months and years would go by? When the humiliation of not being heard or seen would start robbing him of hope and worthiness. When the teacher would tell his mother in PTMs that he was just not keeping up with the rest of the class. When the structural injustices would lead to him being alienated or even bullied. No medals on sports days, no limelight on stage, no stories in school magazines, no poetry or painting on class board. Just years and years of invisibility. And maybe there would be a time he would hide all the pain behind defiance of “I don’t care,” bunking classes and a fog of anger. Maybe he might become like that young boy from senior school who told me, “I feel like a ghost in school, everyone looks through me.”
As I shook my head from the spiral of doom, I looked back to see him still standing there — waving at me with the same glee. I waved back and there was a different lightness in my heart and my walk as I told myself, “Or maybe it will be all right. Maybe he will find an audience for his stories.”Advertisement
Story is not a story until it has found an audience
We make sense of this world through stories as they help us give meaning to our experiences. They do not just describe our lives, but they shape our lives, too. Would a turning point happen in the little boy’s life when he would meet a teacher who would give him an audience for his stories to take wings and fly?
Bubble Time: An amazing teacher I know uses what she calls ‘Bubble time’ to weave in audience for children’s stories. She arranges it well in advance and all her kids love this ‘Bubble time’ where they talk about anything they want to — their worries, life in general, pressures, dreams, hopes and aspirations. It is like a focused light that she intentionally shines on each child, one at a time so that no child is left invisible.
She told me that even if there were 40 children in a class, through a cyclical roster, each child could get at least 10 minutes of “bubble time” every two months. The intention was to touch base and give a mindful, undistracted audience without any judgment, lecture or attempt at fixing the child. It was done in a very casual, relaxed, friendly manner with no agenda. Just to communicate a simple message, “I see you; I hear you and you matter to me.”Advertisement
I remember a friend once shared with me a difficult time she was going through in her life when she was in school. One of her teachers approached her in the corridor and patted her on the shoulder with a gentle and understanding smile. That’s it. This is the warm memory she is carrying with her till today. Maybe many of you will have treasured memories of a teacher reaching out and letting you know that you were not alone.
Appreciative audience: Visibility can be created through show-and-tells in the classrooms, birthday celebrations, award ceremonies, assemblies, annual days, PTMs, sports days and so on and so forth. It could be done through creative certificates that children get as recognition not just for academic or sports excellence but for otherwise unnoticed things like, ‘having a brilliant sense of humour’, ‘being kind’. Emails of recognition, messages of gratitude, letters of appreciation, and acknowledgement on the school website, blogs, social media and magazines. There could be designated noticeboards, podcasts, and announcements in schools that become powerful tools for spreading these richer narratives. And not just for a chosen few but for all. Children are seeking these audiences and that may be the reason that teenagers take to Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube in such a big way as it gives them an audience to hear and become visible.
Album of life: Imagine if every child had an album from the day, she entered school. Every year the teachers, her peers and her parents could add different stories to it. It could be acts of courage, sparks of creativity, wisps of compassion, marks of endurance, threads of sensitivity, snapshots of leadership, leaps of out-of-the-box thinking and strands of passion that could be woven together over the years. Pictures, notes, pages, handprints, drawings, awards, paintings, photocopies, recordings — so many ways to honour a child. Even if a teacher added two highlights every year, there would be around 28 precious items in each box. Imagine children’s excitement if they could be presented this collection on their birthdays or their thrill and pride when they are presented their final album when they graduate from school.
For audiences to be impactful, they have to be gyaan-free, they have to be diverse, they have to shine on preferred stories of the child, they have to build a sense of solidarity and not competition, and most of all they have to honour the dignity of every child and give the message that, “You matter, no matter what.”Advertisement

Sameera Reddy opens up about her parenting journey: ‘Being a parent brings out the child in you’Premium Story,"Actor Sameera Reddy is a true momfluencer. Going by the moniker ‘Messy Mama’ on Instagram, she frequently shares parenting tips with her fans and followers. Her snippets with her kids and mom-in-law, Manjri Varde, are both wholesome and humorous, providing an insight into her personal life.
Recently, in an interview with Tweak India, Sameera shared some tips and tricks for modern parenting. Mom to two kids, Hans and Nyra, she opened up about her own parenting challenges and how she overcame them.
On being asked what her favourite childhood memory is, Sameera said, “During evening time after school, when you would have a little snack, and you would do your home work, and then go down and take a little chalk and draw hopscotch lines…the innocence of playing soccer with your friends and running around the whole building. That was my childhood.”

However with time, technology has replaced play. In such a scenario, how does Sameera introduce the power of play to her kids? Answering this, she said that she allows her kids to play with the most basic of things. “For example, we make paper planes in the house. And with my son, I have seen him build and systematically stay with his toys, such as his Lego sets.”Advertisement
Talking about how kids want instant gratification these days, Sameera said that children get bored with their toys quickly. “It’s thrown somewhere in the corner and then you’re frustrated with them. You think you’ve spent money on that.”
So, encouraging play is important, Sameera explains. “I know it’s hard as parents as we have a lot to do. But you have to take that time, especially during those formative years because children are like sponges, they are going to absorb whatever you are showing to them.”
On a parenting tip Sameera wishes she would have known sooner, was given by her mom-in-law, who scolded her when she saw her keeping Hans (Sameera’s son) really busy all the time.
“She asked me to give my son daydreaming time. And I was like what? My mother used to smack me when I used to daydream as a kid. But she said that I should allow him to just be. Allow him his downtime and me-time. I’m so grateful that she gave me that tip because sometimes he’ll come back from school and just sit on the swing, and he’ll stare at the tree and be lost in his thoughts. Indian parents always think if you’re not being useful then what are you doing,” Sameera said.Advertisement

Sameera believes that the most beautiful part of having kids is that it also brings out the child in you. “I believe that you have to allow it. In fact, today at 44, I feel younger than I did at 35 because I allow myself to just be. Sometimes, I sit with him on the swing and just stare at the tree together. And when he’s going into his little mind space, I am going in there with him.”

New study says city children more at risk of respiratory infections; here’s how to protect themPremium Story,"Young children growing up in towns and cities have a higher incidence of respiratory illness than those growing up in the country, as per a study presented at the European Respiratory Society International Congress in Milan, Italy.
A second study, presented at the Congress and published in Pediatric Pulmonology, demonstrated that going to daycare, living in a moist home, or living near dense traffic all raise the risk of chest infections in young children, although breastfeeding reduced the risk.
Researchers discovered that before the age of three, children living in urban areas had an average of 17 respiratory ailments, such as coughs and colds, compared to 15 infections in children living in rural areas.Advertisement
“Our results suggest that the environment children live in can have an effect on their developing immune system before they are exposed to coughs and colds. We continue to investigate why some otherwise healthy children are more prone to infections than others and what the implications are for later health,” author of the first study Dr Nicklas Brustad, a researcher and physician on the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC) based at Gentofte Hospital and the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, noted.
According to Dr Deepak Sharma, Consultant Pulmonologist, Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, some other reasons that contribute to children in cities being more susceptible to respiratory infections are crowded living conditions, increased indoor pollution, stress, and exposure to allergens.

Why do we need to protect our children? How to do that?
Dr Syed Abdul Aleem, Consultant-Pulmonologist, CARE Hospitals, Musheerabad, Hyderabad, explained that protecting children from respiratory infections is important as they can disrupt a child’s normal activities, and may even lead to chronic respiratory conditions, if not controlled.
Here are five ways to protect children from respiratory infections, according to the experts.Advertisement
Vaccinations
Ensure children receive timely vaccinations against common respiratory infections like influenza, pneumonia, whooping cough, and others as recommended by healthcare professionals.
Clean indoor environment
Maintain good indoor air quality by reducing exposure to tobacco smoke, using air purifiers, and keeping living spaces clean and well-ventilated.
Hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette
Teach children proper handwashing techniques and respiratory etiquette, including covering their mouth and nose with a tissue or elbow when coughing or sneezing.

Nutritious diet and regular exercise
Encourage a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and nutrients to strengthen the immune system. Promote regular physical activity to maintain overall health.Advertisement
Health education and regular check-ups
Educate children and parents about the importance of hygiene, healthy habits, and recognising early signs of respiratory infections. Schedule regular medical check-ups to monitor and address any respiratory concerns promptly.
These measures, when implemented together, can significantly reduce the risk of respiratory infections in children, helping them lead healthier lives.

Rise of dengue in children: Precautionary measures parents can takePremium Story,"More than 4,000 dengue cases have been reported in the country’s tech capital, Bangalore, in the past few days, with a staggering surge in infections among children.
While the health department is yet to release the official data on the number of children affected by the infection, a growing number of infants are being hospitalised with high-grade fever, experiencing temperatures ranging between 103 to 104 degrees.
Incessant rain and waterlogging have increased the spread of mosquito-borne viruses like dengue, malaria and chikungunya. Given that children are more likely to be outdoors — in schools, parks, or outdoor activities — it is crucial to take measures to control the spread.Advertisement
So, we turned to an expert to understand the signs, symptoms and precautionary measures individuals can take to prevent the disease from escalating.
According to Dr Umesh Vaidya, senior pediatrician, Pune, a person infected with these vector-borne diseases will initially show symptoms such as common viral fever, headache, muscle pain and frequent vomiting. “Dengue may also present severe pain near the eyes, muscles, bones and joints. It may also cause skin rashes or minute bleeding spots in the skin and oral cavity,” he said.
While dengue can occur at any age — from infants to old-aged people — Dr Vaidya said that for children, poorly managed surroundings and poor personal protection play a major role in contracting the disease, thereby making prevention of utmost importance.
He added that prevention of vector-borne diseases among children involves two main components — personal protection and mosquito control.Advertisement

“Personal protection includes using window nets, mosquito nets and repellants. Additionally, dressing the child in light colours and full sleeves covering arms and legs, helps in protection,” Dr Vaidya noted.
In terms of mosquito control, the expert said that one should not allow stagnant water in and around the house, and regularly change water from coolers, birdbaths and flowerpots. Moreover, the water tank and water storage containers need to be tightly covered.
Apart from this, if the neighbourhood has fountains, swimming pools or artificial lakes, then it is important that regular maintenance is done, and water is changed to ensure no breeding of mosquitos. Every neighbourhood must control the population of mosquitos by removing breeding grounds and conducting frequent fogging.
While choosing mosquito repellants for your child, Dr Vaidya advised you to look out for the ingredient list. “Since mosquito repellants come in various forms like sprays, sticks, drops or creams, one should check for the ingredients if made from chemicals or from natural ingredients. If the repellant has DEET (diethyltoluamide), then the ideal concentration required for protecting babies and children is 10 to 30 percent, which works effectively for 2 to 5 hours,” he said, adding that children below 2 months should not be exposed to DEET.Advertisement
Similarly, lemon eucalyptus and other essential oils may protect the child from mosquitos for a few hours, however, the expert noted that allergic reactions need to be studied before applying such repellants. On the other hand, mosquito nets and rackets are considered safest for children.

“Protecting children from mosquito bites is critical to prevent dengue, malaria and other diseases. Necessary precautions and use of the right measures will surely help children stay away from such ailments,” Dr Vaidya concluded.

7 red flags your teen might be in an abusive relationship – and 6 signs it’s escalatingPremium Story,"Australian teens need adults to help them recognise red flags for potentially abusive relationships.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates 2.2 million adults have been victims of physical and/or sexual violence from a partner since the age of 15. Almost one in three Australian teens aged 18–19 report experiences of intimate partner violence in the previous year.
But physical, sexual, or psychological abuse in teen intimate relationships remains an invisible issue.Advertisement
The First National Action Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children fails to mention it at all and Australia lacks youth-specific domestic violence support services.
We know teens are experiencing intimate partner violence that is putting their lives in danger.
But they are dependent on informal networks for assistance. Abuse can impact all parts of their lives and their age and stage of development make them even more vulnerable to its effects.
I interviewed 17 young people about their experiences of teen intimate partner violence from when they were under 18. They wanted support and insight from the adults around them.Advertisement
‘I hadn’t experienced a proper relationship before’
Limited relationship experience can prevent young people identifying red flags for intimate partner violence. Interviewee Elise said: As a young teen, I hadn’t experienced a proper relationship before; I just kind of thought this is how it is.
While physical and sexual violence cross clear lines, Australian teens report difficulty recognising more subtle forms of violence and control, such as emotional and technology-facilitated abuse.
7 red flags that can happen early
Young people identified red flags in their past intimate relationships and described how difficult it was to see them in the moment. On their own these behaviours and actions may not be problematic.
For example, spending lots of time together is a relatively normal part of a new intimate relationship.Advertisement
But concern should arise when these behaviours become part of a pattern. They can become integrated into everyday life, making them difficult to recognise – and they can escalate over time.
Here are some examples of red flags for teen intimate relationships that can begin a pattern of violence and abuse:
Being together all the time, using technology to monitor location when not together and a sense of always “being on call” sharing passwords to social media accounts or devices (or setting up shared profiles) turning up unannounced or “as a surprise” saying “I love you” very early in the relationship, talking about living together or having children. This is sometimes called “love bombing” showering with gifts and grand gestures contacting someone’s friends or family to find out where they are framing controlling behaviours as “care” or “concern”.
Young person Gina said: We had a joint Facebook [account], because I wasn’t allowed to really talk to people without him seeing it […] He had to have the password.Advertisement
Ingrid’s partner framed control as care: He’d just perpetually check where I am, and then sometimes he’d just turn up […] He’d be like, ‘I’m just checking that you’re safe.’ If a teen begins to feel like their autonomy and freedom to make choices are being restricted, it is a clear cause for concern. Jamie said: I didn’t have contribution into simple things like what movie to watch.
Sam felt like they had to spend time with their partner, even if they didn’t want to: I’d spend hours […] just watching them play video games, because I didn’t feel like I could go and do something else […] And I hate video games.
6 red flags that suggest escalation
Increasingly problematic (but still difficult to see) behaviours include:
framing the relationship as unique or fated, such as saying the partner is the only person who truly understands them and nobody else could ever “love you like I do” isolating a partner by making it difficult for them to spend time with others assuming sexual activity will happen because “they are in a relationship” framing feelings of jealousy as evidence of love “suggesting” how they should dress or look or encouraging exercise or diet changes insults passed off as “just a joke”.Advertisement
How can you help?
Research shows parents are in a unique position to support teens to foster healthy relationships. Interviewee Addison was among those asking for guidance:
Anybody that can see the relationship [has] red flags. Anybody that is worried for me, I want them to tell me.
Safe and reliable adults can act as role models, ensure safety, involve professionals and empower teens to build safe and healthy relationships.
We can do this by building trusting, open relationships with the teens in our lives, giving them a chance to talk and listening without judgement.Advertisement
If your teenager does not want to talk to you, help them find another person to talk to instead.
It’s important to remember they may not respond the way we hope, but providing support and talking about relationships can decrease the risk of them ending up in an abusive relationship.

Transition from home to preschool: Expert-approved tips for a smooth startPremium Story,"Are you planning to enroll your child into preschool and are anxious how your child would adapt? Are you worried about how they will adjust to the new routine? Well, you’re not alone. A lot of kids suffer from separation anxiety upon transitioning from home to preschool.
For a smooth transition, there are parenting guidelines to help your child settle in preschool. So, we turned to an expert to help toddlers feel comfortable in this new environment and make preschool a holistic experience for the child.
According to Shikha Saxena, AVP-Academics & International Collaboration, Cambridge Montessori Pre-School and Daycare, the right age for children to start preschool is when they are capable of communicating their needs and listening to others.Advertisement
“Children typically benefit from starting preschool between the ages of 3 and 4. Their verbal skills are more developed at this age, allowing for improved communication with teachers and peers. Some children start preschool as young as two, while others may benefit from waiting until they are close to four,” she said.
It is essential for parents to assess their child’s readiness, she said, adding that since each child is unique, flexibility in the scheduling of early education is important.
Besides this, Saxena said that the child should be toilet trained and be able to speak with an adult when they are in need to use the restroom.
Tips to get started
Transitioning from home to preschool can be a significant milestone for both children and parents.Advertisement
The expert advises to visit the preschool with your child the day before their first day, as fear can be reduced by becoming more aware of the surroundings.
Additionally, training children with a daily routine, and encouraging them to complete tasks independently, such as dressing or tidying up, will help boost their confidence and allow them to adjust more easily.
More than that, parents must talk about the preschool positivitely in front of the child, and to develop excitement, can share interesting stories or readings. “Parents should encourage children in getting to know the teacher and developing a good relationship. This trust can help ease fear of separation from parents,” Saxena noted.
Celebrating small achievements at the preschool can help boost the child’s self-confidence.Advertisement
Here are some do’s and don’ts shared by the expert to start your child’s preschool journey:

"Understanding emotional incest, the ‘most neglected abuse’ that can hamper child’s healthPremium Story","Having a healthy parent-child dynamic is important for a child’s well-being as well as the parent’s emotional health. While most children are heavily dependent on their parents to fulfil their needs, the opposite can also be true in some cases.
It is normal for parents to turn to their children for physical and emotional support, but when a parent depends heavily on their child for companionship, it can prove to be extremely unhealthy.
This often leads to a dysfunctional dynamic between the two, referred to as emotional incest, which can further hamper the child’s adult relationship in the future. Explaining this through an Instagram post, Alex Bishop, a relationship anxiety specialist, wrote, “Emotional incest is more common than we’d like to think. Have you experienced this? What was this like for you? How has it affected you in your life and relationship now?”

To know more about emotional incest and what it entails, we turned to experts to understand the phenomenon.Advertisement
According to Deepti Chandy, Therapist and COO, Anna Chandy & Associates, emotional incest takes place when a parent or primary caregiver is unable to establish boundaries and heavily relies on the child to cater for the emotional needs that their adult relationship would provide.
“Emotional incest is quite common in situations where the parents are having a bad marriage or a single parent is bringing up the child,” she said.
In a similar vein, Dr Austin Fernandes, Psychiatrist, Dr LH Hiranandani Hospital, Powai, Mumbai, said, “Also called covert or enmeshed incest, emotional incest is a delicate psychological term explaining the unhealthy emotional relationship between parents and kids. Although unintentional, it might have long-term harmful consequences for the child’s emotional health.”
What does it entail?
Dr Fernandes explained that in emotional incest, the parent may want to share adult problems with their child confidentially, such as marital issues or financial hardships, burdening the child with unwanted emotional duties.Advertisement
“This can result in the child feeling overwhelmed, confused and nervous, as they may not have adequate emotional maturity. They may also struggle to establish healthy boundaries for themselves, and their own desires may be neglected,” he said.
Emotional incest is the most neglected abuse which can have serious implications for those who suffer it. Here are some of the major drawbacks of emotional incest, according to the expert:
*Loss of childhood: Emotional incest can deprive a child of their childhood. Instead of enjoying the carefree period of life which is an important part of their growth and development, they are burdened with adult life obligations and emotional caretaking which might affect their emotional and social upbringing.
*Low self-esteem: In such cases, kids start thinking that their worth is determined by how effectively they meet their parent’s emotional demands. This can be the reason for their low self-esteem and an ongoing sense of inadequacy.Advertisement
*Difficulty in forming intimate relationships: Emotional incest can make it difficult for kids to build a healthy, strong, intimate relationship in the future. They may struggle to set limits and may seek affirmation and approval from others at every stage.
*Emotional discomfort: The continuous emotional support burden at such a small age where all these adult problems need maturity can lead to sadness, anxiety, or even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) over time.
*Guilt and shame: Children who are undergoing emotional incest may feel guilt and shame if start creating boundaries with their parents just to meet their own needs. This can hurt their general development.
*Repeating patterns: Individuals who grew up in such circumstances may unknowingly develop poor habits with their kids if no assistance is provided, prolonging the cycle.Advertisement
If you’re undergoing such a situation, Dr Fernandes suggests some steps to build a healthy relationship again, including identifying and acknowledging the harmful dynamics, seeking professional help, encouraging open communication to express views, setting healthy boundaries, and apologising and making amends for past mistakes.

To build a strong and healthy relationship with your child, you need to spend meaningful time with them, be patient with them and build trust, commit to learning from your past errors and provide love, support and guidance to your child. Prioritising your own emotional well-being is also important, as it will allow you to start a new and positive bond with your child.

14-year-old dies from rabies; how can parents protect their children from dog bitesPremium Story,"After a teenager succumbed to rabies after being bitten by a dog, there has been a new concern among parents on how to safeguard their children from dog bites.
The 14-year-old named Sabez from Ghaziabad had been bitten by a dog more than a month ago, but reportedly kept this a secret from his parents out of fear.
According to the World Health Organization, once clinical symptoms appear, rabies is virtually 100% fatal. It is present in all continents except Antartica, with over 95% of human deaths in Asia and Africa. Additionally, children between age of 5 and 14 years are the most frequent victims of rabies.

To all parents: If your kid gets even a minute scratch from a dog, cat or monkey, and even if it is not bleeding, still immediately get the first dose of Rabies vaccine done within 24 hrs. Rabies vaccine has a 100% efficacy rate but rabies disease has a 100% fatality rate.

Given the gravity of the situation, we turned to experts to understand how to treat dog bites in children.Advertisement
According to Dr Neeraj Kumar Tulara, General Medicine & Infectious Disease Specialist, Dr LH Hiranandani Hospital, Powai, if someone is bitten by a dog, here are the steps one should take:
*Wash the wound: Immediate cleaning of the wound with soap and warm water is essential and should last for at least 5 minutes.
*Apply an antiseptic: The application of an antiseptic solution can minimise wound infection risk.
*Stop bleeding: Bleeding should be stopped by applying gentle pressure to a clean cloth if the wound is bleeding.Advertisement
*Seek medical attention: Medical attention should be sought regardless of how insignificant the bite seems. An assessment of the wound is typically followed by the doctor’s decision on whether a tetanus shot is required.
*Report the bite: If the dog’s vaccination status is uncertain, report the bite to nearby animal control authorities.
Since rabies is a serious and potentially fatal viral infection, a rabies vaccination is necessary when the animal’s behaviour seems abnormal or rabies can’t be confirmed, regardless of the animal’s status.
In such a scenario, Dr Rajiv Chhabra, Chief, Paediatric, Artemis Hospital, Gurgaon suggests getting vaccinated immediately after the exposure. “The rabies vaccine consists of a series of shots that are typically given over a 14-day period. Completing the series is crucial to have effective protection,” he said.Advertisement
If you have been bitten or scratched by a potentially rabid animal or a pet animal, Dr Chhabra advises to get post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with rabies immune globulin and rabies vaccine to prevent the virus from progressing.
Like any vaccine, the rabies vaccine too has mild side effects which include pain or swelling at the injection site.
“Consider consulting your doctor if you think the side effects are bothering you a little too much with your ability to perform routine tasks efficiently,” he said, adding that make sure to consult a healthcare professional for guidance on rabies vaccination and treatment after potential exposure to rabies, as early intervention is vital in preventing this deadly disease.
Regardless of the risk for rabies, Dr Vinit Samdani, Pediatrician, Bhatia Hospital, Mumbai said that bite wounds can cause serious injury such as nerve or tendon laceration and infection. “Your doctor will determine the best way to care for your wound and will also consider how to treat the wound for the best possible cosmetic results.”Advertisement
Additionally, he noted that one should get a tetanus shot if they have not been immunised in ten years, and decisions regarding the use of antibiotics, and primary wound closure should be decided together with the doctor.
How to prevent dog bites

Dr Tulara noted that to prevent dog bites in children, one must ensure their safety through regular supervision of interactions between children and dogs, teaching children to respect the dog’s boundaries and personal space, encouraging petting approaches that are gentle, and educating kids about early warning signs of stress or aggression in dogs.

Moreover, it is crucial that children gain permission from their owners before petting or approaching, avoid dog teasing or taunting, and maintain dog’s privacy by not disturbing them when they are taking their meals, catching sleep or tending to their young.
Apart from this, Dr Samdani suggested that especially if you have pet dogs, then children should be kept in a separate area from the dog. Break your house into zones if you have young children, he said, adding that both child and dog should be well-vaccinated.Advertisement

Pediatric gingivitis: Expert-approved tips to prevent the dental ailmentPremium Story,"Dental hygiene is important for all, irrespective of age. But it is much more vital for babies and adolescents who are at higher risk of tooth decay, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
One of the most common dental ailments that affects children of all ages is pediatric gingivitis — the main cause of which is the build-up of plaque — a sticky film of bacteria that forms on teeth when food particles mix with saliva.
According to Dr Vishwas Patil, Head, Pediatric Dentistry, Surya Mother and Child Super Speciality Hospital, Pune, if plaque is not being removed regularly, it can harden and turn into tartar, which in turn irritates gums and causes them to become red, swollen and bleed easily.Advertisement
Sign and symptoms of pediatric gingivitis
Dr Patil noted that pediatric gingivitis often presents with mild symptoms that can easily go unnoticed, however, certain children may experience specific indications, including red and swollen gums, bleeding gums during oral care routines, gum tenderness, bad breath, and a sensation of loose teeth.
“If you notice any of these symptoms in your child, it is important to see a pediatric dentist right away. Early treatment can help prevent the condition from progressing to periodontitis, a more serious form of gum disease that can damage the bones and tissues that support the teeth,” he said.
Risk factors

There are several factors that can increase the risk of pediatric gingivitis. “Poor oral hygiene and multiple decayed teeth in children who do not brush their teeth regularly or thoroughly are prone to develop gingivitis,” Dr Patil said.
Additionally, thumb sucking, bottle feeding, especially at night, dry mouth, improper chewing habits like food pouching or retention in the mouth, and mouth breathing can make children more susceptible to gingivitis.Advertisement
Further, there are a host of medical conditions that can increase the risk of pediatric gingivitis, including diabetes, sickle cell anaemia, immune system disorders, certain medications such as steroids, and vitamin C deficiency.
“If your child has any of these medical conditions, it is important to talk to your pediatric dentist about how to prevent and treat gingivitis,” Dr Patil noted.
However, the good news is that pediatric gingivitis is a preventable condition. Here are some tips to prevent gingivitis in children, as per the expert:
*Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste daily to brush your child’s teeth.
*Floss your child’s teeth once a day.
*Take your child to the dentist for regular checkups and cleanings.
*Limit your child’s intake of sugary drinks and snacks in between meals.
*Instill in your child the habit of drinking plenty of water.
*Teach your child about the significance of good oral hygiene.
*If your child has a medical condition that increases their risk of gingivitis, talk to their doctor about ways to manage the condition.Advertisement

Kindergarten conduct problems may cost society later: Study,"For the first time, a new economic analysis has linked kindergarten students’ conduct problems to large societal costs in terms of criminality, associated medical expenses, and lost productivity when they become adults.
“Providing effective, evidence-based programming designed to address behavioral problems early on has the potential to improve students’ wellbeing in the long term,” said project collaborator Damon Jones, associate research professor in the Edna Bennett Pierce Prevention Research Center (PRC). “This study implies that there could be an additional benefit of reduced need for government services and lower costs related to crime, where conduct problems are reduced.”
Researchers reviewed teacher- and parent-reported data on conduct problems among more than 1,300 kindergarten students from two multi-site, longitudinal studies conducted in U.S. schools in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They used government and administrative data to determine the costs associated with crimes committed by the students through age 28. The team reported their results in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry.Advertisement
The researchers found that increased behavioral problems — such as oppositional or antisocial behavior — in kindergarten students were linked to more than $144,000 in costs, on average, per student related to crime and associated medical expenses and lost productivity as these children reached adolescence and adulthood.
“This study is the first to establish a connection between kindergarten students’ behavior and crime-related costs when the children became adults,” said Yoon Hur, assistant research professor at Penn State’s Evidence-to-Impact Collaborative. Hur collaborated with Natalie Goulter, lecturer at Newcastle University, on statistical analyses for the study.
Approximately 42% of the students with increased behavioral problems had costs related to crimes involving violence, substance use, public order or property. Further, 45% had costs related to government services use, 41% had costs related to medical services use and 58% had costs related to any of these categories.

“Data from studies such as these can be used by local, state and national governments to inform budget planning that could support prevention where early risk for conduct problems can be determined,” Jones said. “Many studies have demonstrated that investing in young children through effective intervention can lead to economic benefits for people and public services over time.Advertisement

How to get your child to sleep in their own roomPremium Story,"If you’re a parent who can’t get their child to sleep in their own bed at night, you’re not alone. Convincing your child to sleep in their own bed can be a challenge once they have gotten into the habit of sleeping in your bed.
They might want another bedtime story, feel scared alone or sneak into your bed at the middle of the night. While you may want to coddle them and let them sleep in your bed, this might encourage unwanted behaviour or could become a bad habit in the future. But every problem has a solution. So, we turned to actor-influencer Roshni Chopra, who recently shared a few tips to get kids to sleep in their own room and stop them from wanting to jump into your bed every night.
First, she advised to get them their own bed that will give them a sense of independence and pride. You can buy some comfortable bed sheets and pillow sets to make the space according to their liking.Advertisement
Second, make bedtime a ritual. “We love talking about our best and worst parts of the day and saying thank you for the simple things that make life beautiful. This helps them unwind and drift into slumber,” Chopra said.
Lastly, wait till they are just about to doze off, say goodnight and exit the room while they’re still awake, so they don’t wake up in the middle of the night trying to find you.

A post shared by Roshni Chopra (@roshnichopra) 


Concurring, Nishtha Grover, Child and Adolescent Psychologist said that Indian parenting is quite different from Western models of parenting as children here are often coddled for nourishment and nurturance for a significant period of time.
“Initially, sharing the same room while the child is an infant is easier for caregiving, however, as a child starts growing it’s essential for the parents to have personal space for a better spousal relationship and holistic development of the child,” she said.
To get your child to sleep in their own room, the expert advises to follow a gradually progressive pattern rather than an abrupt shift. Children are emotionally very perceptive of changes around them and making them comfortable will only smoothen the transition.Advertisement
“The parents can begin with allowing the child to feel safe in their space by spending some time with them in their room. Slowly, once familiarity with a personal space is established, the parents can set up bedtime routines like storytelling or sharing how their day looked like,” she said. “Research has shown that sharing personal anecdotes or stories at bedtime strengthens attachment and allows the child to be confident about their future as they derive a sense of safety from their guardian’s assurance.”

Additionally, Grover said it’s vital to understand the importance of consistency in sleep patterns. “Developing a set schedule for sleep automatically attunes the child’s memory to follow it strictly. It would be even more effective if you share the same bedtime with your child as children learn exceptionally well through modelling that is observing their role models (often the parents in childhood) exhibiting the same behaviour that is expected of the child.”
Grover recommends that the child sleeps with the parent at least for an year, after which a cot can be placed in the parent’s room. However, children above the age of 3 or 4 should be encouraged to sleep by themselves.

“Research published in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) concludes that when children develop the habit to sleep alone, they display higher self-worth, enhanced cognitive performance and decrease the likelihood of developing fears of sleeping alone,” she said.Advertisement

Try this beverage to keep your child hydratedPremium Story,"As the humidity peaks during monsoons, there is a need to stay hydrated, especially young children. While water is an obvious choice, natural foods also have an ability to cool down the body. As such, child nutritionist Mona Narula took to Instagram to suggest an age-old remedy to beat the heat.
Narula said that khus sharbat, made from dried khus roots, have several health benefits for children. “An excellent source of fibre, it is rich in vitamins A, B, C and minerals like zinc, iron, calcium, manganese along with antioxidants and omega-6 fatty acids.”
According to her, as a result of these antioxidants, it helps boost metabolism, strengthens bones, is great for gut health, heart functions and the nervous system among many other benefits.Advertisement

Understanding the negative impact of helicopter parentingPremium Story,"All parents want the best for their children. For this, many parents go to extremes to make their child’s life easier — either by paying too much attention to them or by being overly supportive of their needs.
This brings us to an important question — how much attention is too much? Should you ever ignore your child? Or can you overly engage with your kid? The answers to these queries are hotly debated among parents.
While we know that supportive parenting approaches are essential for a child’s development, a particular parenting style called ‘helicopter parenting’ does more harm than good.Advertisement
First used in Dr Haim Ginott’s 1969 book, ‘Between Parent and Teenager’, the term ‘helicopter parent‘ describes a parent who would hover over their child like a helicopter.
Similar to the terms ‘lawnmower parent’ or ‘bulldozer parent’, such parents not only hover but also mow down or bulldoze any obstacles in their child’s path. It is considered to be the opposite of free-range parenting where independence and thinking for oneself is encouraged.
What exactly is helicopter parenting?
According to Simrun Chopra, Deep Health Coach, Nutritionist and Founder of Nourish with Sim, a ‘helicopter parent‘ is heavily involved in every little aspect of their child’s life and they tend to take on too much responsibility for every success and failure their child endures.
She added: ‘It starts with good intentions of being involved in our children’s lives. While parents might believe this level of involvement is necessary for the well-being of their children, research shows that it has several negative aspects.”Advertisement
‘Helicopter parents’ usually go to extreme lengths to protect their children from negative outcomes like not qualifying to the sports team, receiving bad grades, and shelter them away from real-world problems. This could mean completing school projects for your child, choosing friends for them, or refusing to let your child solve problems on their own.
Due to societal pressure around spending more time with children and being extremely involved, ‘helicopter parenting’ is becoming more popular. However, Chopra pointed out that it can cause a lower level of confidence or coping skills in children. Similarly, a study published in the journal Frontiers of Psychology revealed that it may have negative implications on the child’s mental health such as anxiety and depression.
What is a better style of parenting?

There is no one good way of parenting, as per Chopra, but parents who help their children make independent choices and decisions from early childhood, allow their children to build a sense of confidence and make better decision on their own.
“The authoritative parenting technique is more collaborative in nature and is assumed to be one of the best,” she said, adding that it is focused on solving problems together, setting clear rules and expectations and having open and clear lines of communication.Advertisement
Such a parenting style teaches children to rise from failures, encourages them to make decisions and deal with the outcomes, and let them pick extra-curricular activities and fail at them.
For children to make independent decisions in critical situations, Chopra recommends parents to give them the right tools that will help them build resilience and understand self-reliance.

“With the level of exposure and access to information children of today have, it is imperative to give them the tools to be on their own while knowing their parents are there to back them without judgement,” she said.

Keep your child’s eyesight in check with these expert-approved tipsPremium Story,"Your child’s eyesight is of paramount importance. Good vision helps them take in the world around them and is essential for the optimal development of children. Parents and caregivers can ensure that their child’s vision remains nurtured and protected through various proactive measures.
Understanding the prevalent eye conditions faced by children and essential steps for safeguarding their eyesight can help a child’s overall growth and learning ability.
According to Dr Priyanka Singh, Consultant & Eye Surgeon, Neytra Eye Centre, New Delhi, eye diseases are very common in children as they are unable to tell the problems they are facing with their vision. If not treated on time, these gradually become a permanent disease, and the child has to carry it throughout their life.Advertisement
Some common eye diseases present in children, as per Dr Singh are:
*Refractive error and lazy eye: If a child has refractive error (near sightedness, far sightedness or both), they will be unable to see clearly. This error can be corrected with suitable spectacles, however, if not corrected on time, the brain senses this blurred vision as the final vision, which after a certain time can lead to lazy eye or amblyopia.
*Squint (crossed eyes): It occurs in about 1 to 4 per cent of children and mostly becomes evident within 3 to 4 years of age. In this, either one of both the eyes are turned inward or outward. This can occur due to refractive errors or non-refractive error reasons (due to muscles and nerve misalignment).
*Allergic conjunctivitis: There has been an increase in the incidence of eye allergies in children due to high levels of pollution, pollens and increased screen time. This causes itching and rubbing of eyes, leading to occasional redness and rise in the incidence of eyelid and eye infections.Advertisement
*Cataract: It is a rare condition in children leading to visual loss, which can be fully corrected by cataract surgery. If not done at the right time, it leads to amblyopia (lazy eye) and permanent blindness.
*Blocked tear duct: It is a condition present early in life (mostly just after birth, characterised by watering and discharge from eyes due to blockage of tear duct. At early stages, the blockage can be opened by eye massage only. In later stages, it needs surgical intervention to open the blockage. Thus, it is best to consult an oculoplastic surgeon as soon as possible for the best outcome.
Tips for protecting your child’s vision

Your child’s vision health affects how well they can see, learn and enjoy life. Here are some measures you can take to protect your child’s eyes and their developing vision, according to Dr Singh:
1. Eat healthy: A diet rich in vitamin A, D and antioxidants keeps most of eye problems at bay. So, children should be given lots of green and colourful veggies, fruits and nuts, in their diet.Advertisement
2. Limit screen time: Screen time should be minimised as follows: Children less than 2 years should have no screen time, 2 to 5 years should have maximum 1 hour of screen time daily, and 5 years and above should have maximum of 1.5 to 2 hours of screen time every day. Additionally, children should be encouraged to play outdoors.
3. Keep an eye on warning signs: If something does not appear right, then consult an ophthalmologist immediately.
4. Regular eye exams: Get your child’s first eye checkup before they start school (around 3 to 4 years) and routine eye checkups yearly thereafter.

Pain that heals and restoresPremium Story,"He is more of a mythical creature than a cat. At times he looks like a giraffe, at times a lemur, at times a rabbit. at times a dolphin and then so much more. So when he went missing, it was difficult for us to explain what he looks like to people. We printed pictures, we made posters, and we stuck them on the walls and poles all around our colony and beyond.
But how can pictures capture the spirit of this being that we were learning to understand in the past two years? When people asked his name, each one of us came up with a different one, confusing everyone even more. He never did have one name but it changed with time and as he grew into each one he found home in. Infantata, Taata, Taati, Baati, Baatu and many more and he would respond to each. Until he did not and we were only left echoing each other’s calls from different alleys, nooks and crannies. To return home and sob in our own corners so as to not inflict more pain on the others as carousels of heart-wrenching images spun in our heads at night.
Like all love stories, Taati’s story also has a history. Before he was born, his feral mother decided to adopt our daughter during the first year of the pandemic. No animal had lived with us after our dog’s death due to old age. Which was very unusual for a family that had housed dogs, fish, turtles and even nursed a tiny squirrel (a story for another time). We called her Cat and grew to love her and were bewitched by her strange ways. You have to live with cats to know how strange they are. She came and went as she pleased and would get us gifts of love every now and then – dead rats, the head of a pigeon, the feathery carcass of a bird. We retched but were touched by her random love.Advertisement
One day, she walked into our balcony with something in her mouth and as I prepared to face another morbid death, I came face to face with life. A tiny ball of fur perched in a corner who spat and snarled at us when we tried to get any closer. His mother left him with us for one night to test our love and his endurance. The first one, our Taati, let her know that we could be trusted and promptly she brought in the other three. Two stayed with us and two found another home and it has been more than two years since that night. We believe it was a miracle the way he found us and now we waited for another miracle to find him.
I write this piece with an appeal, an apology and appreciation. The appeal is to witness all the pains in the world and not to disenfranchise ones that do not fit our assumed definitions of loss. So many children I meet carry the pain of the loss of a pet that they were not allowed to grieve for as parents, sweep in with a brand new one with: “Now you can forget about him and love this one.” As a 13-year-old shared with me, “I am laughed at for still missing my dog who was my brother for 12 years.” When I shared my pain in a long message to a close friend, she replied, “So sorry” and then a silence spanning over two weeks. Otherwise, a loving person with an immensely generous heart she unwittingly dismissed the distress of the loss of an animal as not significant enough.
The apology or, I should say, sense of contrition is that people experience immense tragedies on everyday basis and what we went through does not seem to come anywhere close to that. And yet the grief was as real and palpable as the loss of a dearest family member. The kindness of strangers kept us going as they called us, messaging us pictures of lost and feral feline lookalikes. Their caring eyes and unhesitant invites soothed us as we marched to their terraces, combed their gardens and ledges and crooned in the heavy rains, “Taata…Taati…Baati…Baatu.” Making a range of offerings with the hope that he might be in the mood for one. Our hearts started living in our calls at night. It also woke up our neighbours but they responded with their offerings of water, assurance and food. The guards, the presswallas, the kudawallas and the army of roadside soldiers who stay invisible until we call out for help. Deep appreciation for witnessing our pain and standing by us.
It is the pain that has helped me step out of what Tagore described as, “dreary desert sand of dead habit,” and live a more uninhibited life even while I felt most raw. My introverted self has found itself stopping people on the road and sharing our story, walking into people’s homes with no hesitation, and taking any and every help that came our way. We got to know every cat, every dog, and the way trees, ledges and top of the cars find home for so many of these homeless souls. In the heart of Delhi, we chanced upon peacocks, hoopoes, owls, ibis, flame-backed woodpeckers, kingfishers and hornbills. We witnessed life when we stepped out of the comfort of our homes. We also learned to cry together, give each other long hugs and realise, how we persist against all odds due to what holds us together.Advertisement
Like all my favourite love stories, this one has a happy ending too. There was a chance encounter in one of our night rounds, our torch beam spotted a likeness and an immediate response to our call. For two nights we kept close track and a rescue campaign was planned with military precision by our son. Taata had been braving the urban wilderness for over 18 days and though he pined for home, his survival skills watched us work our way back to his heart again. After all, everything that we have loved and lost has to be wooed back.

Pain is testimony to all things we hold precious. As a young person reflected, “We have to live through grief to understand life.” The pain churns us in a way that we are never the same again. After Taata’s return, we are astonished at what we in jest refer to as his “Master Shifu spirit”. As if he has experienced all the pain and hardships and returned all the wiser, loving and at peace, making us wonder how life can grow around the cracks and heal. As long as we learn to keep the faith.

"New study suggests that Mediterranean diet during pregnancy improves 2-year-olds’ cognitive, social abilitiesPremium Story","Mothers who consumed the Mediterranean diet during pregnancy increased their children’s cognitive, social and emotional development at 2 years old, as compared to children whose mothers did not follow the diet, according to a new randomised clinical trial.
Similarly, children of mothers who took stress-reduction classes during pregnancy scored higher in social and emotional well-being as toddlers compared to children whose mothers did not receive the training, said the study published in JAMA Network Open.
The study followed children born to 1,221 high-risk mothers who were part of The Improving Mothers for a Better Prenatal Care Trial in Barcelona, conducted between February 2017 to March 2020.Advertisement
While one group of women was told to follow the Mediterranean diet, the other group was assigned to pregnancy yoga, meditation and mindfulness group sessions, which were focused on the relationship between the mother and foetus.
Approximately two years after the women gave birth, researchers found that there was a positive difference between children whose mothers ate a Mediterranean diet compared to those who did not. Stress-reduction training also increased scores of social and emotional development, but the Mediterranean diet intervention was more prominent.
What is a Mediterranean diet?
According to Richa Anand, Chief Dietician, Dr LH Hiranandani Hospital, Powai, Mumbai, the Mediterranean diet includes fresh juicy fruits, crispy veggies, whole grains, olive oil, lean meats like fish, herbs and spices.
Further, Neelima Bisht, Chief Clinical Nutrition, Dietetics department, Paras Health, Gurugram pointed out that red meat, processed meat and food, alcohol, sweets, sugary drinks and butter are strictly avoided in the Mediterranean diet.Advertisement
“As the name suggests, this diet pattern is inspired by the traditional eating habits of countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea such as Greece, Italy, Spain, Morocco, Egypt and Lebanon. This nutritious diet helps in managing weight, protects the heart, prevents diabetes and other chronic diseases,” she said.
Experts weigh in on the study

Concurring with the findings of the study, Dr Aparna Jha, Obstetrics & Gynecology, Apollo Cradle & Children’s Hospital, Marathahalli, Bangalore noted that chances of mothers developing gestational hypertension or diabetes are lesser if pregnant women follow the Mediterranean diet. If these health complications are lesser, it will in turn lead to fewer pre-term deliveries and more neurologically mature babies.
“A diet which includes nuts, olive oil, and fish is naturally rich in antioxidants, monounsaturated fatty acids, and omega-3 fatty acids, which has a positive impact on the neurological or cognitive function of babies. Additionally, a Mediterranean diet is a great source of B group vitamins, which prevent neurological defects in the early trimesters,” she added.
Explaining the mechanism behind this, Prachi Jain, Chief Clinical Nutritionist & HOD (Nutrition & Dietetics), CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram said that during pregnancy, a woman experiences a lot of physical, hormonal and emotional changes, thus her nutritional needs also increase for the proper growth and development of the foetus, so whatever a woman eats during her pregnancy directly affects the baby’s health.Advertisement
Agreeing with the above, Dr Milloni Gadoya, Gynecologist, Apollo Spectra, Mumbai said that embracing a Mediterranean-inspired lifestyle during pregnancy not only benefits the expectant mother but also sets her child on a path towards lifelong health. With its emphasis on whole foods rather than processed options, this dietary approach encourages nutrient-rich meals that provide essential vitamins and minerals for both mother and baby.
However, she added that it is essential to consult an expert who will guide you after taking your complete history and conducting an examination.

“Making informed dietary choices not only benefits pregnant women personally but also sets a solid foundation for their little one’s future health journey,” Dr Gadoya concluded.

Guidelines For Parents to deal with abdominal pain in childrenPremium Story,"Tummy pain is common in children of all ages. It could be due to hunger, excess intestinal gas or many simple causes. It can often be confusing for the parents when to seek medical attention. This article aims to help parents know what to do if their child complains of pain in their tummy.Register Now.

Why does my child have tummy pain?
The problem in finding out the exact cause for crying is confounded by the fact that babies cannot communicate. Some babies cry a lot without any apparent cause, but many have a clear pattern. In babies less than 6 months the most common cause is “Evening colic” or “Infantile colic”. These babies cry suddenly mostly in evenings, drawing up their legs to tummy with clenched fists. Babies with crying behaviour may have a highly active gut due to the excess gas swallowed during crying which in turn cause abdomen colic, discomfort and cry. Herbal remedies such as “gripe water”, “vasumbu” are not advisable which may aggravate or cause more trouble. These babies grow well and crying habit clears away after 3 months. In children more than 6 months the most common causes of abdomen pain is constipation. Passage of inordinately hard stools is defined as constipation. It is noted in 17% – 40% of cases; 95% cases of constipation are functional and only 5% are due to organic reasons. The pain could also be due to swollen lymph nodes in the abdomen, urinary tract infection, surgical conditions like appendicitis, intussusception, bowel ulcerations, bowel obstruction which in turn are commonly associated with constipation, rare intestinal anomalies, rarely renal stones, menstrual pain, rare medical conditions like pancreatitis, tuberculosis, food allergies like cow milk allergy or wheat allergy.
What causes constipation in children?
Sedentary lifestyle due to mobile phones, television and internet have significantly decreased outdoor playtime in recent years. The child thus tries to postpone defecation or does potty incompletely. In a child <1year it could result from changes in infant formula, early or late weaning and early (<1year) oral cow milk initiation. In toddlers, difficulty in toilet training or sickness, moving house, change in daily routine, starting schools, antacids and cold medications can cause constipation. In older children rushing to schools, inadequate time for morning potty habits, phobia to use school toilets and screen distractions can cause functional constipation. Organic causes could include Hirschprung’s disease, hypothyroidism, abnormal anal openings.
When should I think about talking my child to the doctor?
It is never unreasonable to seek medical attention if you are worried about your child. You should not delay seeing a doctor if you are concerned about your child, or if they:

Have severe pain
Have pain that lasts for several hours, or is repeated pain
Complain of pain to right side of tummy
Complains of pain below umbilicus and pain while passing urine
Have combination of fever (body temperature > 100 F ) or skin rash
Appear pale, tired or drowsy
Have prolonged vomiting or diarrhoea
Have blood in their vomit, poop or urine
Have any swelling or lumps in their tummy or groin or painful swelling of their genitals
Straining while passing urine or smelly urine with or without blood
Passing “Ribbon like stools” (more likely in child less than 1 year)

When should I take my child to the emergency department?
There are a small number of times when it is necessary to attend an emergency department, such as:

Your child experiencing tummy pain after trauma such a fall or ingestion of acid/alkali/foreign body.
Green vomiting.
Swollen testicles in boys.
Sudden groin swelling which is not reducing.

What care can be given at home before consulting my doctor?

Have your child lie down and rest.
Do not force your child to eat if they feel unwell.
Gently massage your child’s belly which can help with gas and indigestion.
Give small sips of water frequently to prevent dehydration.
Encourage sitting on the toilet in a proper position, sometimes emptying the bowel helps to ease the pain
It may be useful to record a video when your child is in pain to see the pattern or photo of vomiting/pee/poop to show your doctor.

What does a doctor look for when checking my child?
Doctors look at number of things including their response, complaints, general appearance, their heart rate, breathing rate, temperature, as well as taking into consideration information you have told us. They will examine their tummy. You will be surprised at how much information we get from simply laying a hand on their tummy. If the abdomen is soft when pressing and not sore, then a serious cause for their pain is much less likely. (if your child is in lot of pain when you touch their tummy you should seek a doctor without delay). Simple tests like checking the blood cells count, checking their blood and urine for infection, scan of abdomen and Xray of abdomen will be done. Finally, all the information is assessed and the cause is worked out.
What if no cause is found?
Often no cause is found, and this is quite confusing. This is referred to as functional abdominal pain and is quite common (affecting 10 – 15% of children). Some children may also have repeated abdominal pain when they are worried (about themselves, friends, family or school).
What is the outlook or future of these children?
Majority of the patients do well with appropriate dietary management, medical management and surgical management if they reach without delay. Recurrence depends  on patient’s long-term compliance with therapy. Post treatment, these patients often experience a greatly improved quality of life.
Advices to prevent abdomen pain in children?

Adequate fluids, fiber diet, avoid junk food.
Proper toilet training and undistracted morning potty habit.
Never give gripe water, vasumbu and castor oil to purge.
Prevent self-medication which can mask or worsen pain.
Glycerine suppository in constipation gives immediate relief. 
Find out trigger factors (like specific food, activity sometime even sun heat) and avoid.

Childhood inactivity is associated with cardiac disease in young adults: Study,"According to a study presented at ESC Congress 2023, hours of inactivity during childhood could be laying the groundwork for heart attacks and strokes later in life. Even in people with normal weights and blood pressure, the study found that sedentary time accumulated from childhood to young adulthood was linked to cardiac damage.
All those hours of screen time in young people add up to a heavier heart, which we know from studies in adults raises the likelihood of heart attack and stroke, said study author Dr Andrew Agbaje of the University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland. Children and teenagers need to move more to protect their long-term health. This was the first study to look into the connection between young people’s sedentary time as measured by smartwatches and later-life heart disease.
It was carried out as a part of the Children of the 1990s project, one of the largest cohorts with lifestyle assessments starting at birth and beginning in 1990/1991. 3 Children aged 11 used an activity tracker-equipped smartwatch for seven days. This happened once again at age 15 and once more at age 24.Advertisement
At 17 and 24 years of age, the weight of the left ventricle of the heart was measured by echocardiogram, a form of ultrasound examination, and expressed as grammes per cubic metre of height (g/m2.7).
After adjusting for variables that could affect the relationship, such as age, sex, blood pressure, body fat, smoking, physical activity, and socioeconomic status, the researchers examined the relationship between sedentary time between the ages of 11 and 24 and heart measurements between the ages of 17 and 24.
From 11 to 24 years of age, every additional minute spent sitting was linked to a 0.004 g/m2.7 rise in left ventricular mass between 17 and 24 years of age. This translates to a daily rise of 0.7 g/m2.7 or a 3-gramme increase in left ventricular mass between echocardiogram measurements at the average height gain when multiplied by the additional 169 minutes of inactivity.
A similar rise in left ventricular mass (1 g/m2.7) during a seven-year period was linked to a two-fold greater risk of heart disease, stroke, and mortality in adults, according to a prior study.Advertisement

Dr. Agbaje said, children were sedentary for more than six hours a day and this increased by nearly three hours a day by the time they reached young adulthood. Our study indicates that the accumulation of inactive time is related to heart damage regardless of body weight and blood pressure. Parents should encourage children and teenagers to move more by taking them out for a walk and limiting time spent on social media and video games. As Martin Luther King Jr. once said, if you can’t fly, run. If you can’t run, walk. If you can’t walk, crawl. But by all means, keep moving.

Do children get cancers?Premium Story,"Cancer is often thought to be a disease of adults. Unfortunately, cancers are also seen in children but what is fortunate is the treatment and outcomes.

Globally around 4 lakh children and adolescents (0-19 years old) are diagnosed with cancer. In India annually greater than 50 thousand children are diagnosed with cancer. This accounts to nearly 20% of the global childhood cancer burden, according to world health organization (WHO).
In high income countries 80% of the children with cancer are surviving whereas it is reverse in low- and middle-income countries including India where only 20% of children with cancer are surviving. This is because of lack of diagnosis, misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis and inadequate treatment/incomplete treatment.
Facts regarding childhood cancers
Cancers in children are completely different from the cancers seen in adults. They are treated by a specialist called Pediatric oncologist trained exclusively for treating the children with cancer.
Most common types of childhood cancers are Leukemias [Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)], brain cancers and solid tumors. Solid tumors include Wilms tumor (arising from kidney), Neuroblastoma (arising from adrenal gland), Retinoblastoma (Eye tumour), hepatic tumors, bone tumors, sarcoma etc.
Why do cancers occur in children? 
Unlike adults the reason for cancer in children is not known. About 90% of childhood cancers occur sporadically. Only 10% of children have genetic predisposition.
Some infections like hepatitis B (HBV) and human papilloma virus (HPV) have tendency to increase the child’s risk of developing cancer as an adult so it is important to get vaccinated against these viruses. Hepatitis B vaccine to protect from liver cancer and human papilloma virus vaccine to protect from cervical cancer.
When to suspect cancer in children?

Recurrent fever or prolonged fever not responding to antibiotics.
Severe bony pains associated with night cries.
Paleness of body/ bruising/bleeding episodes.
Unexpected weight loss.
Whitish pupil in the eye or sudden onset squint.
Lump or mass in arm, neck, chest, abdomen or pelvis.
Headache especially early morning headache relieved by vomiting.
Swelling or persistent pain in joint, bone, or back etc.

How to identify the cancer before it develops? 
There is no screening method to identify the cancer. The only way is to be aware of symptoms, timely evaluation and prompt treatment.
How is childhood cancer treated?
Treatment of childhood cancer has gone a long way over the decades. Modality of the treatment depends on the type of cancer and the stage of cancer.
Chemotherapy, surgery, radiation, immunotherapy, targeted therapy and bone marrow transplantation are the different modalities of treatment.  No two children would get similar treatment even if it is a same diagnosis. Treatment is tailored according to the risk status and response of the child so that neither the child is overtreated nor undertreated but adequately treated.
Apart from the actual therapy, the most important aspect of the treatment is the supportive care. Appropriate supportive care is the most essential part for the optimal outcomes in childhood cancers.
Children also need special attention to their nutrition, growth and development during the process of treatment. Another important part of the treatment is the psychological support to the family as they have to stay strong and support their child in this through various ways.
Is Childhood cancer curable?
Yes, cure is possible for more than 80% of children with cancer, in the setting of effective evidence-based treatment and adequate supportive care.
Children are not mini adults. Cancers seen in childhood are unique and require different kinds of care and Pediatric Oncologist services for better outcome, survival and long-term growth and development.

Mothers with depression more likely to experience parental stress: Researchers,"Researchers revealed that mothers with depression were more likely to experience parental stress and less likely to think they were competent parents compared to women who were not depressed.
Dr Dow-Fleisner’s findings, which were reported in the Journal of Family Issues, have important implications for the support that social workers, clinical professionals, families, and communities may be able to provide.
In contrast to the postpartum period, when mothers are most at risk for depression, Dr Dow-Fleisner wanted to focus on depression that strikes children later in life. Her team used data from a significant longitudinal US study to compare the characteristics of depressed and non-depressed mothers of nine-year-old children.Advertisement
They also acknowledged using more severe methods of punishment, such as denying the child of privileges or employing aggressive techniques like cursing or threatening them. If they had a child, they were less likely to take part in school activities like going to open houses. However, they were equally likely to assist with household duties like homework.
Being a mother with depression carries increased risks for a child’s physical and psychological health, said Dr Sarah Dow-Fleisner, Assistant Professor in the School of Social Work and Director of the Centre for the Study of Services to Children and Families at UBC Okanagan. But it’s not fated to be, especially if mothers have external supports. Furthermore, mothers with depression reported fewer interpersonal supports and community resources than mothers without depression, said Dr Dow-Fleisner. This is consistent with previous research. Interpersonal support referred to both emotional and material help from others, such as a relative providing advice or emergency childcare.
Community resources refer to safety and neighbourhood cohesion. Neighbourhood cohesion measures the willingness of neighbours to help and the shared values of the neighbourhood, among other social and trust factors.
Notably, those mothers with depression who reported higher levels of support and cohesion felt less stressed and more competent in their parenting, said Dr Dow-Fleisner. These positive perceptions translated to less psychological aggression-based discipline and more home and school involvement with their children. These findings fit with a resilience perspective, whereby mothers facing adversity like depression can still thrive as parents, especially when these protective factors are present.Advertisement
We want to help moms both address their depression and improve the child’s health and wellbeing this is known as a two-generation approach, said Dr Dow-Fleisner. As mothers may not seek out help for their depression alone, a child health check-up in a primary care setting is a good opportunity to screen for maternal depression and provide support in identifying interpersonal supports and community resources. Dr Dow-Fleisner added that capacity building should take precedence over just solving acute parenting issues in supporting programmes. A community-based parenting support group, for instance, might assist a woman in creating a network of individuals who could offer financial and emotional assistance when necessary.
One such community-based organisation is Mamas for Mamas, according to Dr Dow-Fleisner. Mamas for Mamas, which has locations in Kelowna and Vancouver, fosters a sense of community and offers moms and other carers material and other forms of help.

Further funding of programs that empower mothers including those experiencing mental health concerns would go a long way in improving the health and wellbeing of children, mothers and families, said Dr Dow-Fleisner.

Take Time: Teenage anger and how to manage itPremium Story,"Adolescents are growing and changing and the hormones that drive puberty can have a big impact on mood. When children seem like they’re overreacting, it’s important to remember that they are less able to manage big feelings, like anger than adults are. The stereotype of the eye-rolling, door slamming rebellious adolescent is often played for laughs, but for parents dealing with the real thing, it’s anything but funny. Bitter outbursts, unpredictable mood swings and frequent battles about everything from school to friends to clothes to who’s going to set the table can leave parents feeling like they’re walking on eggshells. The pandemic has caused two years of frustration and disruption. No school, no hangouts and no parties, endless time spent on screens and cooped up with family, stress about getting into college, add to that the greater issues adolescents are facing: The ongoing fight and uncertainty about what the future holds can add to this raging anger.

It’s okay to be angry
Parents should strive to see teenage anger not as something to be dispelled or overcome but as a normal part of being a person. Being angry doesn’t mean that there is something wrong, it just means that you have to find ways to deal with the feelings better. The goal shouldn’t be to stop teens from feeling anger, but to help them find safer, less harmful, and even productive ways of expressing it.
Finding healthy ways to process anger can be a challenge even for the most mature of adults, but for teenagers, biology creates an extra layer of difficulty. Though on the outside, teens may basically seem like grownups, their brains and bodies are still growing.

Decoding angerAdvertisement
Helping kids learn to talk about what’s causing their anger can be hugely important.  Irritability, mood swings, or outbursts may be symptoms of disorders like anxiety and depression. Reactions to trauma or negative experiences with which kids feel unable to cope can also surface as bursts of temper. Even less significant struggles, like trouble at school or college, or problems with friends or relationships can masquerade as anger, especially if kids lack the tools to investigate and articulate their feelings. So what should parents do?
Reach out
If you notice your teenager has been angrier or more irritable than usual, don’t skirt the issue. Instead, let them know you’ve noticed something is wrong and invite them to talk when they’re ready. “I can tell you’re feeling upset. I’d really like to help. Can we make time to talk?” If your child seems resistant, take a step back and wait it out for a couple of days. Saying this will keep the door open for future communication.
Validate and show respect
When your child is ready to talk, let them know you take their feelings seriously. When your child expresses anger about something, be careful not to minimise or dismiss it. Instead, acknowledge how they’re feeling and do your best to ask questions and listen without passing judgment or trying to “solve” the problem.
It can also be hard not to feel frustrated when your teenager is angry, as it may often be, and that anger is directed at you. But even when kids are being incredibly difficult, they are still relying on you to be the calmer influence and to let them know that how they are feeling matters to you. Taking a moment to really acknowledge their emotional experience can also help defuse the situation.
Check in with yourself
It is hard to be your best self under pressure. Nobody likes being yelled at or having a door slammed in their face. Parents are only human, and teenagers can be infuriating. It’s normal to feel frustrated, confused or furious. But kids (yes, even teenagers) look to parents for cues on how to behave. And, as with so much of parenting, helping children learn the skills they need to cope with anger, is more about showing, not telling. Checking in with yourself is key to responding effectively, especially when you’re already feeling frustrated.
Be conscious of your body language and tone. How you say things can matter just as much as what you’re saying. For example, “I’m sorry you’re feeling so frustrated” sounds good on paper, but if you’re saying it through gritted teeth, you’re unlikely to get a good response. Practise mindfulness skills, like deep breathing, counting to ten, or taking a walk to clear your head and let your teenager see you doing it.
Take a breakAdvertisement
It can be tempting to charge headlong into an argument, but realistically, no one is at their best when they are angry. If you or your teen are struggling to keep your temper during an exchange, don’t press it. Instead, model healthy coping skills by choosing to take a break until you’ve cooled off. Be open and clear about your reason for pausing the conversation. Come back to the conversation when you’re both feeling less upset. You’ll not only be giving yourself, and your teenager, a better chance at saying what you really mean, you’ll also be demonstrating the value of learning how to de-escalate.
When to seek help
Anger, frustration, irritation, even rage are all a normal part of being a person. Teenagers are prone to intense feelings, but if your teen’s anger is having an outsized, negative impact on their life, it may be time to seek some help.
Anytime that there’s consistent violence or consistent aggression that just can’t be stifled or doesn’t really necessarily correlate with the stimulus — for example, if the explosions are really out of proportion for what’s going on, those are red flags.
Everyone’s threshold is going to be different, but if a child’s anger is impacting their ability to function, or having a serious impact on the family at large, or there’s concern about physical harm, like getting into fights or hurting themselves or others, that’s when it’s time to seek outside help.Advertisement
Finding ways to give a little space and a little grace, and being intentional about acknowledging and enjoying good moments with your teenager will help you both feel more connected and give you both something to come back to when blow-ups inevitably do happen.

How to raise your kids in a junk food-free environmentPremium Story,"All kids love junk food, from French fries to burgers to pizza. And in all honesty, we adults love them too. But we all are well-aware that these ultra-processed foods are bad for our bodies, especially our children’s.
According to Dr Suresh Kumar Panuganti, Lead Consultant – Pediatric Critical Care and Pediatrics, Yashoda Hospitals, Somajiguda, Hyderabad, the most commonly used or available unhealthy foods that children eat are broadly categorised as JUNCS (junk foods, ultra-processed foods, nutritionally inappropriate foods, caffeinated/carbonated drinks/beverages, sugar-sweetened beverages).
“Children should try and avoid JUNCS as much as possible or limit consumption of these foods at home and outdoors to not more than one serving per week — serving not exceeding 50% of total daily calorie requirement for that age,” he added.Advertisement
Most of these junk foods are nutritionally inappropriate — it gives good taste but does not meet nutritional requirements. In addition to this, Dr Kumar noted that excessive salt can cause adverse effects on the kidney and heart, excessive sugar can cause obesity and diabetes as well, and the prolonged exposure of additives can cause cancer.
“High sugar content in carbonated and sweetened beverages can lead to dental caries, and contamination of these beverages can cause diarrhea, Typhoid fever, Hepatitis and also dreaded diseases like Leptospirosis, which cause liver and kidney failure. Over consumption of caffeinated drinks may cause psychiatric and sleep disturbances as well,” he said.
Here are some parenting tips to build a healthy diet for your children, according to Dr Kumar.

It all starts earlyAdvertisement
Exclusive breastfeeding till 6 months of age. Weaning should start and continue with home-based foods that are easily available, easy to digest, sustainable and culturally acceptable.
Be mindful of the nutrition portions
Total calories in a healthy meal should be divided as 15–30% from fats, 10–15% from proteins, and 55–75% from carbohydrates. Free sugars should be <5% and there should not be any trans fat.
Recommended salt intake up to 12 months is <1 g salt, 1–3 years <2 g, 4–6 years <3 g, 7–10 years <5 g, and for ≥11 years 6 g per day.

Psoriasis Awareness Month: How to manage psoriasis in childrenPremium Story,"Every year, August is marked as Psoriasis Awareness Month. Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune skin condition that can affect people of all ages, including children.
According to Dr Swapna Priya, Consultant Dermatologist, CARE Hospitals Hitech City Hyderabad, the exact cause of psoriasis is not fully understood, but genetics and immune system dysfunction play significant roles.
“Some children might be more susceptible due to a family history of psoriasis or other autoimmune disorders,” she said, noting that environmental factors, stress, infections, and certain medications can trigger or exacerbate psoriasis in children.
Symptoms of psoriasis in children Advertisement
According to Dr Priya, red, raised, and thickened patches of skin with silvery scales, itchy and painful skin, dry and cracked skin that can bleed are some common symptoms of psoriasis.
Less common symptoms that might be missed include nail changes, such as pitting, discolouration, and separation from the nail bed, joint pain and swelling (psoriatic arthritis), which can affect a subset of children with psoriasis’ scalp involvement, leading to flaking and scaling (scalp psoriasis).

What are the risk factors of children who may contract psoriasis?
Several factors can increase a child’s risk of developing psoriasis are as follows:Advertisement

Genetics: Family history of psoriasis significantly raises the risk.
Immune system: An overactive immune system triggers inflammation, leading to psoriasis symptoms.
Stress: Emotional stress can exacerbate symptoms.
Infections: Certain infections, especially streptococcal infections (such as strep throat), might trigger psoriasis or make existing symptoms worse.
Obesity: Excess weight can increase inflammation, worsening psoriasis symptoms.

"Babies almost all try crawling to get from Point A to Point B, but CDC says it’s not a useful developmental milestonePremium Story","Infant milestones can be a source both of pride and anxiety for a new parent. Baby’s firsts – first tooth, first steps, first word – are moments of joy that many parents immediately compare with charts listing “normal” age ranges for each achievement to occur.
For a pediatrician, these milestones are useful indicators of typical or atypical development. When they occur outside that normal range, it might be time to look for some underlying cause, which could enable early detection and intervention if something’s amiss.
Since 2004, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published a set of milestone checklists as part of its “Learn the Signs. Act Early” program. Important skills are listed for a series of ages, enabling anxious parents to know whether baby is developing typically.Advertisement
In early 2022, the CDC published a major update to the milestones. The new version has a much stronger basis in research evidence and has attempted to simplify language and help caregivers know when to contact a health care provider. Among all the changes, a major milestone was removed. Crawling no longer appears in the milestone checklists.
Crawling to get from here to there
As infants develop awareness of the world around them, they naturally start wanting to explore it. Mobility is the gateway to that exploration. Crawling is typically an infant’s first efficient strategy to get from Point A to Point B, and it often means that new parents must suddenly baby-proof their home and make sure all the Point Bs are safe.
Crawling is a transitional phase of mobility – children and adults are capable of crawling but choose to walk if they’re able to do so – and it often overlaps with precursors to walking such as pulling-to-stand and “cruising” while holding on to furniture.
Studies have indicated that over 80% of infants progress through hands-and-knees crawling during development of locomotion. Others use alternative crawling strategies like scooting along on their bottoms, or rolling.Advertisement
The World Health Organization studied hundreds of children around the world and found that, on average, children develop hands-and-knees crawling by 8.5 months of age. But that’s just an average. Of course babies each develop on their own schedule. The range for starting to crawl (the 1st percentile to the 99th) was 5.2 to 13.5 months. And 4.3% of the babies in the study skipped hands-and-knees crawling altogether.
Clinicians who work with children have long recognized the importance of motor development. Scientists have called motor behaviors the “raw material for perception, cognition, and social interaction.” In particular, crawling can be an early window to understanding a child’s problem-solving strategies. And researchers have used movement analysis at 4-6 months, when some babies are getting close to hands-and-knees crawling, for early diagnosis of disorders such as autism and cerebral palsy.
Therapists worry that removing crawling from the milestone list means it will be devalued and the important physical, sensory and cognitive benefits it affords for the baby will be missed when evaluating childhood development.
Off the evidence-based list of milestones
Much of the CDC’s reasoning for removing crawling from the milestone list is centered on data.Advertisement
Pediatricians have charts that say how fast children typically walk based on their age, but no such normative data exists for crawling. There are no clear, laboratory-based descriptions of the various types of crawling. We lack long-term studies that show when babies transition between patterns. And there are very few studies on the implications of skipping crawling and going straight to walking.
Despite these data gaps, crawling has been studied for nearly a century, and researchers have used it to understand the complex development of multiple neuromotor systems. Crawling is also important in understanding developmental continuity, or where new skills grow from.
Nonetheless, the CDC is correct: There are no age-based normative data charts for crawling as there are for walking.

As a biomedical engineer who specialises in pediatric locomotion biomechanics, I have firsthand knowledge of this lack of crawling data.Advertisement
I’ve used a technique called 3D motion analysis for decades to gather minute details on the walking of children with limb loss, cerebral palsy and other neuromotor conditions, all in an effort to help improve their mobility. My colleagues and I attach small markers to skeletal landmarks like hips and knees, and special cameras track the markers and reconstruct skeletal movement.
But among all my lab’s studies on walking, I’ve completed only one 3D motion analysis study on crawling. We examined the motion of very young children with limb loss in a new prosthetic treatment protocol developed here at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta – but it was really tricky to do.
We had to create new musculoskeletal models for our analysis system. We had to use tiny reflective markers, because babies make more contact with the ground than older kids, and a big marker might be uncomfortable. We had to position cameras at new angles to track those tiny markers. Diapers created a big challenge, given their movement relative to the baby’s skeleton.
And as any parent or caregiver can attest, babies can be a tough population to work with. They don’t follow directions well, they’re temperamental, and they’ll pull a reflective marker off their skin and pop it in their mouth in a second if you let them. We had to watch our study subjects like hawks.Advertisement
In short, crawling is just more difficult to study than walking.
Collecting crawling data
To address this challenge, my colleagues and I are now embarking on what we believe is the largest lab-based study of infant crawling development. We’re studying babies from their first crawling attempts all the way through their transition to walking.
This study relies on a new technique with a pressure-sensing pathway that avoids the complications of 3D motion capture. We’ll see 75 typically developing infants, and also study children with limb loss and cerebral palsy.
Our goal is to gain insights into how children transition from crawling to walking, with the hope they will one day help health care providers understand early motor development and spot neuromotor issues earlier.Advertisement

We’re also hopeful that these hundreds of visits to the lab will result in the first normative data set on crawling development, addressing some of the issues that prompted the CDC to remove crawling from the milestone list. So, while our lab stays full of toys, Cheerios and baby wipes for a few years, we’re generating data that might improve parents’ and clinicians’ understanding of early motor development.

Teach your kids the significance of Independence Day with these engaging activitiesPremium Story,"Independence Day is just around the corner! Every year, the day is celebrated on August 15 — a reminder of India’s struggle of freedom and independence from British rule that lasted for more than 200 years. Around the nation, the day is commemorated with great fervour and passion. Various cultural events, parades and flag hoisting activities that highlight the solidarity of the nation, take place on this special occasion.
However, young children may not realise the significance and historical context of this great day, thereby making it important for parents to introduce the concept of Independence Day and instill values of patriotism and historical awareness in their children.
Here are some engaging ways to teach kids about the importance of Independence Day:
StorytellingAdvertisement
One of the best ways to teach your children about the Indian Independence movement and freedom struggle is through stories, after all children of all age groups adore stories. You can start by organising a reading event in your home or locality and invite other neighbouring families to read stories aloud, highlighting the sacrifices of our great freedom fighters. This will deepen your child’s understanding towards the day and foster a great bond between family and friends.
Go for a historical walk
Nothing tells us more about our history than the places where the historical moments took place. There are several landmarks and monuments connected with India’s freedom struggle, including the Red Fort, Jallianwala Bagh, Gandhi Ashram and many others, that provide children with a deeper knowledge about India’s glorious history. You can visit museums as well since children are fascinated with age-old artefacts and manuscripts.
Get crafty

They can make tricolour badges, t-shirts, paper flowers and much more. This will add more thrill to your celebrations.
Sing patriotic songs
What could be more fun than organising a patriotic karaoke or a game of Antakshari at home with friends and relatives? Tune into the melodious songs that highlight the greatness of our nation such as Ae Mere Watan Ke Logon or Mere Desh Ki Dharti. Alongside, make your kid understand the real meaning behind every lyric.
Movie marathonAdvertisement
Independence Day is the best time to gather your loved ones to binge on some patriotic films lie Gandhi, Mangal Pandey, Chak de India, Border and more. Showing patriotic films to your child will help them understand the nuances of the day better and have a powerful impact on them.

6 tips for cutting costs on back-to-school shopping,"When Meghan Lakata’s kids return to school from summer break, they’ll have new (to them) clothes and supplies. But thanks to some creative shopping habits, the mother of two isn’t stressed over back-to-school spending.
Lakata, a pre-K teacher in Maryland, uses tools like state sales tax holidays, cash-back apps and buy-nothing groups to keep back-to-school costs down. Bulk purchases help, too.
“I have the two kids and there’s a lot of overlap in what they need,” Lakata says. “So, if I can get like a big 48-count of pencils, I’m going to do that.” If back-to-school spending forecasts for 2023 are correct, every little bit of savings might help. According to the National Retail Federation, families with children in kindergarten through 12th grade will spend a record $41.5 billion on back-to-school shopping this year. An additional $94 billion will be spent on back-to-college shopping. Those figures make the back-to-school season the second-largest spending period of the year, after holiday shopping.Advertisement
Here’s how to keep more money in your pocket this season.
1. SALES TAX HOLIDAYS
Search your state tax administrator’s website to see whether your state is one of several with a tax-free holiday. If so, in-person and online shopping for items like clothing, books, school supplies and electronics during the designated time frame could provide a 4%-7% pad to your budget.“I’m planning on getting the kids a couple of new items they want and school supplies that week,” Lakata said, adding that she’ll save 6% without sales tax.
These holidays generally run in July or August. Lakata says this is the time to buy supplies, not only for the tax exemption, but because items are cheaper.
“That box of crayons that’s 50 cents in August is going to be like $2.50 in December,” she says. “They drop the prices so much for back-to-school, but we feel like we can’t get the same deals if we restock midyear. You’re going to pay a lot more.”
2. STUDENT DISCOUNTS ON ELECTRONICSAdvertisement
Electronics top the planned back-to-school expenditure list in 2023, with an estimated $38 billion to be spent for K-12 and college students, according to the NRF survey.
College students can qualify for “education pricing” from companies like Apple, Microsoft, Samsung and Dell. This could lead to savings of 10%-20% or more on that new laptop, tablet, phone or monitor.
Plan to purchase directly through the manufacturer to get the discount; purchases at big box stores like Best Buy or Walmart generally won’t count.
3. BUY-NOTHING GROUPS
An estimated $25 billion will be spent on back-to-school and back-to-college clothing this season, the NRF says. But that could be an expense to offset with your local buy-nothing group.Advertisement
Buy-nothing groups offer a way for individuals to rehome and gift goods to one another, with no buying, selling or bartering. You can find your community on the Buy Nothing Project website.
“I try to get as much as I can on the buy-nothing Facebook page,” Lakata says. “I got an entire wardrobe of clothes for my kids. I don’t buy new clothes often for them, just because you can get them for free.”
4. CREDIT CARD BONUSES
Many new credit cards come with a sign-up offer that can earn you hundreds of dollars’ worth of cash-back or travel rewards. Since you’ll have to spend a certain amount of money in a specific window to earn those rewards, periods of high spending can be the perfect time to get a new card and offset some of your costs.
But aim to pay your statement in full each month. If you carry a balance, the interest can negate any rewards.
5. BUY IN BULKAdvertisement
Whether it’s lunch food or school supplies, buying in bulk can lead to big savings — but have a plan. Over purchasing can erode the savings you made elsewhere. Lakata says she looks at the school supply list and identifies things both her kids, in 4th and 5th grades, will use; then she buys those items in bulk at a discount. “Composition notebooks can often be cheaper in a multipack, and last year both kids needed them,” she said. “Or plastic folders. I can get a six-pack of those instead of buying them individually and save money.”
6. CASH-BACK APPS AND WEBSITES
Whether you shop in store or online, a few extra steps – or clicks – can get you a percentage back on your purchases.
Apps like Receipt Hog and Ibotta provide cash back for in-store purchases if you scan your receipt. Once the purchase is verified, cash back or rewards redeemable for gift cards will be deposited into your account.“After any shopping trip, I take a quick picture of my receipt using cash-back apps,” Lakata said. “Those little points add up.”

If you prefer shopping online, visit a cash-back portal like Top Cashback or Rakuten before you pay. Such portals offer percentages back at a multitude of websites, as long as you click through from the portal first. Your bank or credit card may also offer bonus rewards for shopping through their websites.Advertisement

‘From Struggles to Solutions: Himalaya Unveils ‘Happy Baby Zones’ Campaign during Breastfeeding WeekPremium Story,"Breastfeeding week was celebrated from 1st to 7th August 2023, shedding light on the pressing issue of inadequate spaces for nursing mothers in public areas. In India, women often find themselves struggling to breastfeed their babies comfortably and privately while on the move. A recent survey reveals that only 6% of mothers can find breastfeeding rooms while commuting or traveling*. As per recent studies, an overwhelming 81% of mothers feel uneasy about breastfeeding in public due to the absence of suitable spaces*. Additionally, 36% of babies in India are not exclusively breastfed for the recommended six months, according to the World Health Organization (WHO)**.
In a bid to address this concern, Himalaya BabyCare, a trusted name in baby care products, has unveiled its heartwarming ‘Happy Baby Zones’ campaign during Breastfeeding Week. Himalaya’s commitment to maternal and infant wellness has been well-known for years and that shines through the campaign as well. 
The campaign emphasizes on the urgent need to establish secure and private environments where mothers can breastfeed without feeling uncomfortable or exposed. In addition, Himalaya BabyCare has also undertaken an ambitious initiative, conducting 500 Nurses Education Programs across India, effectively training 5000 nurses in baby and maternal care. Furthermore,  they’ve collaborated with over 20,000 doctors to raise awareness about breastfeeding.Advertisement
The campaign video opens with the portrayal of mothers grappling with the task of soothing their crying babies in various public scenarios, which strikes a chord with the audience. The mothers fail in their attempt to make their babies quiet because of the absence of suitable facilities. The campaign takes a heartening turn as a caring hand extends toward these struggling mothers, guiding them toward a solution. In a moment that encapsulates the power of positive change, the mothers’ expressions transform from distress to surprise, relief, and pure happiness. The pivotal solution lies in Himalaya’s ‘Happy Baby Zones,’ sanctuaries designed exclusively for breastfeeding and strategically placed across Airports, Railway Stations, and Hospitals.
The ‘Happy Baby Zones,’ which were introduced by Himalaya in 2012, have served as a haven for over 12 lakh mothers across India. These zones provide a serene, hygienic, and private space where mothers can nurse their babies without any apprehension. The campaign’s ultimate goal is to support breastfeeding mothers, driven by the myriad advantages it offers for both infants and mothers. The importance of breastfeeding has never been a surprise. Breastfeeding not only supplies optimal nutrition and aids babies’ brain development but also reduces the risk of diseases. For mothers, it acts as a shield against ovarian and breast cancer, helps prevent depression, and even mitigates the risk of diabetes.
Watch the video here:

Commenting on the campaign, Mr. Chakravarthi N V, Director –BabyCare, Himalaya Wellness Company, said, “At Himalaya BabyCare, the well-being of mothers and babies is a top priority. With this campaign, we intend to break barriers and promote a breastfeeding-friendly society.

Rise of diabetes in adolescents: Nutritional advice to counter the problemPremium Story,"People with diabetes have blood sugar (glucose) levels that are too high. Over time, diabetes can damage the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves — causing chronic problems and early death.
The frequency of diabetes is rising around the world, and recent studies show that children are at increasing risk of developing the disease, according to the World Health Organization.
Explaining the rise of diabetes in adolescents, Dr Meghana Pasi, Nutrition Consultant, MyThali, Arogya World said that the age of onset of diabetes in India is 10 years earlier than in Western countries, posing a greater challenge as more individuals enter their productive working phase with this great risk.Advertisement
Additionally, she noted that with urbanisation and economic development, there has been a significant shift in the lifestyle of adolescents in India, which has led to greater prevalence of sedentary behaviour. “According to the WHO (Lancet 2019) study, 75 per cent of teens are inactive, leading to weight gain and obesity, which is a significant risk factor for type 2 diabetes.”
Sharing that there have demographic and social changes in the country, Dr Pasi said that the middle class is growing exponentially, and more people are migrating to the cities for livelihood — causing more exposure to processed and unhealthy foods, increased screen time, and inactivity.
Moreover, the aggressive marketing of unhealthy foods and sugary beverages to children and adolescents through social media and brand advertising has influenced dietary choices — a major contributor to diabetes.
She also explained that some adolescents may have a genetic predisposition to developing diabetes, have a lack of awareness about symptoms, or limited access to healthcare, which can hinder the timely diagnosis and management of diabetes.
Can diabetes be prevented in adolescents?Advertisement

Answering in the affirmative, Dr Pasi said that a lot of compelling research has revealed that diabetes can be prevented. “The WHO clearly states that three lifestyle changes — adopting a healthy diet, engaging in regular exercise, and avoiding tobacco use — can prevent a significant portion of diabetes (80 per cent), heart disease (80 per cent), and certain cancers (40 per cent).”
However, this requires a holistic approach that addresses their lifestyle choices, Dr Pasi said. Here are some dietary guidelines to help adolescents lead a diabetes-free life, according to the expert:
Dos
*Have a balanced diet: Encourage adolescents to follow a balanced diet that includes a variety of foods from all food groups. The diet should consist of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.
*Control portion sizes: Teach portion control to avoid overeating as excessive calorie intake can lead to weight gain and increase the risk of diabetes.Advertisement
*Have regular meals: Encourage adolescents to eat regular meals and healthy snacks. Skipping meals or long gaps between meals can lead to unhealthy bingeing on sugary foods and imbalances in blood sugar levels.
*Stay hydrated: Promote drinking plenty of water throughout the day and discourage sugary beverages like soft drinks and fruit juices.
*Increase the fibre intake: Encourage consumption of fibre-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts. Fibre helps regulate blood sugar levels and supports overall digestive health.
*Choose healthy fats: Replace saturated and trans fats obtained from processed and bakery foods with healthier options like monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats found in foods like avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fish.Advertisement
*Get on a regular exercise routine: Motivate adolescents to engage themselves in any physical activity (running, swimming, cycling, football, dancing) for at least 60 minutes every day. This can help maintain healthy body weight and improve insulin sensitivity.
*Manage stress: Help children learn to manage stress through activities like yoga or spending time with friends and family.
*Go for regular health check-ups: Keep a check on their body weight and overall health and take them for a check-up when required.
*Educate this group: Try to spread awareness of the risk factors of diabetes and the importance of a healthy lifestyle to prevent it.
Don’tsAdvertisement
*Limit sugary foods and beverages: Reduce the consumption of sugary foods and beverages such as sodas, energy drinks, candies, and sweets. These items can lead to a rapid increase in blood sugar levels and contribute to insulin resistance.
*Limit consumption of processed foods: Minimise the intake of processed and fast foods as they are often high in unhealthy fats, added sugars, and salt.
*Limit salt intake: Help adolescents reduce consumption of high-sodium foods like ready to eat, ultra-processed foods, and namkeens as excessive salt intake can contribute to high blood pressure, which is a risk factor for diabetes.
*Avoid FAD diets: Discourage them from following any FAD diets that may eliminate entire food groups or promote extreme restrictions. This can lead to micronutrient deficiencies.Advertisement
*Limit their screen time: Limit screen time for recreational activities and encourage outdoor play and social interactions.
*Keep them away from substance abuse: Make them aware of the health hazards of smoking, alcohol, and illicit substance use, and try to keep them away from it.

“Education on healthy eating habits, regular physical activity, and avoiding tobacco can happen at home, in their community, and in schools. By integrating health education into the school curriculum and fostering a supportive environment at home, we can empower adolescents to make healthier choices,” she concluded.

"A mother’s healthy diet can ensure good brain health of her grandchildren, genetic model study suggests","Mothers who eat apples and herbs during their early pregnancy could be protecting the brain health of their children and grandchildren, a Monash University study using genetic models has found.
The discovery is part of a project that found a mother’s diet can affect not just her child’s brain but also those of her grandchildren.
Published in Nature Cell Biology, the Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute study found that certain foods could help prevent the deterioration of brain function.Advertisement
This study used roundworms (Caenorhabditis elegans) as the genetic model because many of their genes are also found in humans, allowing insights into human cells.
The researchers found that a certain molecule present in apples and herbs such as basil, rosemary, thyme, oregano, and sage helped in reducing the breakdown of communication cables needed for the brain to work properly.
Senior professor Roger Pocock, with his team, investigated nerve cells in the brain that connect with each other through about 8,50,000 kilometres of cables called axons. For axons to function and survive, essential materials need to be transported along an internal structure that contains microtubules.
Pocock explained that a malfunction that caused the axons to become fragile can lead to brain dysfunction and neurodegeneration.Advertisement
He said his team used a genetic model with fragile axons that break as animals age. “We tried to find whether natural products found in the diet can stabilise these axons and prevent breakage,” he explained.
“We identified a molecule found in apples and herbs that reduces axon fragility — ursolic acid. How? We found that ursolic acid causes a gene to turn on that makes a specific type of fat. This particular fat also prevented axon fragility as animals age by improving axon transport and therefore its overall health.” Pocock said this type of fat, known as a sphingolipid, had to travel from the mother’s intestine, where food is digested, to eggs in the uterus for it to protect axons in the next generation. He said while the results were promising, they still need to be confirmed in humans.
“This is the first time that a lipid/fat has been shown to be inherited,” he said. “Further, feeding the mother the sphingolipid protects the axons of two subsequent generations. This means a mother’s diet can affect not just their offspring’s brain but potentially subsequent generations. Our work supports a healthy diet during pregnancy for optimal brain development and health,” Pocock said.

Simple and effective tips to keep your child’s dental health in checkPremium Story,"Every parent wants the best for their children, especially when it comes to nutrition and health. However, the oral health of kids is often neglected, leading to dental problems in young babies and adolescents.
Dental health for kids is an important part of their overall health and should be established early. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), tooth decay is one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood but is completely preventable. So, we turned to an expert to understand the common mistakes children make regarding their dental hygiene and how parents can take care of their kid’s oral health.
According to Dr Rajeev Chitguppi, Periodontologist, Head of Research & Innovations, ICPA Health Products Ltd, all parents want their children to have bright, healthy smiles that light up their faces but there are some common mistakes that children often make with their dental health.Advertisement
“These mistakes can have a significant impact on their oral well-being. One of the most common mistakes children make is irregular brushing or rushing through it which leaves harmful plaque and bacteria behind. Cleaning between teeth is another aspect often overlooked by kids. It is crucial to remove food particles stuck between teeth because this is the area most prone to dental problems. The risk is higher among kids that consume sugary treats and drinks frequently,” he said.
Additionally, Dr Chitguppi pointed out that parents should be aware of pacifier use. “A pacifier is a small, soft and rubbery object that parents often give the babies to suck on. It is a dummy or soother that helps calm and soothe babies. However, prolonged pacifier use can lead to misalignment of teeth.”
But every problem has a solution. Similarly, parents can take some simple steps to keep their child’s dental health in check. 
 Parents should schedule regular dental check-ups every six months to catch and address any potential issues early on. (Source: Freepik)
*Parents should establish a consistent brushing routine for their children, with a soft-bristled brush and fluoride toothpaste, making sure the kids brush at least twice a day.Advertisement
*To reduce the risk of cavities, parents must opt for nutritious snacks for their kids, instead of sugary treats.
*Parents should schedule regular dental check-ups every six months to catch and address any potential issues early on.
*Parents can make brushing a fun family activity by including stories, poems or reward systems, to encourage the child to maintain good dental health.
At the same time, to ensure your child’s optimal dental health, there are some things you should avoid.Advertisement
“Advise against using teeth as tools to open packages or crack nuts, as it can cause chipping or damage of tooth surfaces. If your child sucks their thumb or fingers, try to discourage prolonged thumb sucking to prevent potential misalignment of teeth,” Dr Chitguppi said adding that parents must not ignore dental concerns and address them promptly to prevent further complications.

7 conversations every parent must have with their teenagerPremium Story,"During the tumultuous and transformative phase of adolescence, teenagers undergo a multitude of changes as they embark on a journey to discover their unique identities and values. According to recent studies, the maturation of the neocortex happens around 24 years. This is the seat for cognitive functioning.
The process of self-discovery can be perplexing and demanding, requiring parental presence and understanding to serve as a stabilising anchor in the tempestuous sea of self-exploration.
According to Dr Harini Atturu, Consultant – Psychiatry, CARE Hospitals, Hi-Tec City, Hyderabad, fostering proper communication with teenagers becomes a crucial cornerstone in guiding them through this critical period of their lives.Advertisement
“When parents engage in open, sincere, and empathetic conversations with their adolescents, they create an atmosphere of reassurance, where the young minds find solace in knowing that their concerns, anxieties, and aspirations are met with genuine attention and support,” she said.
Regular and meaningful dialogue with adolescents allows parents to be well-informed guardians, better equipped to safeguard their children from harm and nurture responsible decision-making.
Dr Atturu explained that the first step for parents should be to not expect their teenager to behave in the right way. “Genuinely, they don’t understand the need or drive for such behaviour and the reason why they have to change from what they are to what is expected. So, educating them in an explorative way is important.”
Here are 7 non-negotiable conversations you must be having with your teenagers.Advertisement

Sex and relationships
Dr Atturu said embracing the gravity of discussing sexuality and relationships, irrespective of whether a teen is sexually active, empowers them with knowledge regarding consent, respect, and the potential risks involved, ensuring they make informed choices when navigating the complexities of intimate connections.
Drugs and alcohol
Addressing the sensitive issue of substance abuse becomes an essential parental responsibility as per Atturu. Conversations centred on the perils of drugs and alcohol, in light of potential family histories, serve as a potent deterrent and provide a sense of security by assuring adolescents of parental support during challenging times.
School and career
As adolescents approach adulthood, discussions about their academic aspirations, career goals, and the path they envision for themselves become paramount. “By offering guidance and assisting in the development of a comprehensive plan, parents become invaluable allies in their teens’ journey to achieve their dreams,” said Atturu.
Social media and online safetyAdvertisement
In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, parents must engage in ongoing conversations about social media and online safety. “Addressing topics such as online predators, cyberbullying, and appropriate digital behavior will help teenagers navigate this virtual realm responsibly,” added Atturu.

Mental health and well-being 
According to Atturu, recognising the significance of mental health, parents must converse openly with their teens about their emotional well-being. Ensuring adolescents feel supported and understood when facing mental health challenges is vital for promoting overall resilience and wellness.
Financial responsibility
While often evaded, discussions about financial literacy and responsibility are indispensable for teenagers’ future financial well-being. “Engaging in conversations about budgeting, saving, and avoiding debt equips adolescents with essential life skills as they embark on their financial journey,” said Atturu.

Exploring the depths of life’s meaning and purpose is a fundamental aspect of the human experience, as per Atturu. Parents can enrich their relationship with their teenagers by engaging in meaningful conversations about values, goals, and aspirations, fostering a sense of purpose and direction in their lives.
These non-negotiable conversations serve as the pillars of a robust parent-teen relationship. By nurturing an environment of open and honest communication, parents can instill a sense of trust, remain actively involved in their teenagers’ lives, and provide them with the tools necessary to make informed and responsible choices that will resonate throughout their journey into adulthood.

"‘Barbie’ is, at its core, a movie about the messy contradictions of motherhoodPremium Story","The wildly popular “Barbie” movie has been touted for its celebration – and critique – of femininity.
As a mother and a media scholar, I couldn’t help but see “Barbie” through an even narrower lens: as a film that, at its core, is about mothers and daughters.
The film’s plot centers on a life-size doll, known as “Stereotypical Barbie,” played by Margot Robbie, who begins to malfunction: Her feet go flat, and she can’t stop thinking about death. So she leaves her perfect plastic life to embark on a quest to restore the boundary between the real world and Barbieland. Along the way, she learns that the real world is nothing like her girl-power wonderland, where Barbies hold all the positions of power and influence and Kens are just accessories.Advertisement
But its thematic heart rests in the film’s examination of the tensions around being a mother – a role often taken for granted, even as the cultural fantasies of motherhood clash with the actual sacrifices that moms make.
Motherhood as mere drudgery?
I was immediately struck by the movie’s funny but chilling observations about motherhood.
“Since the beginning of time,” unseen narrator Helen Mirren intones sardonically in the film’s first line, “since the first little girl ever existed, there have been dolls.” (Cinephiles will immediately recognize this scene and its setting as an homage to Stanley Kubrick’s famous “dawn of man” opening from “2001: A Space Odyssey.”) Girls appear on screen, wearing drab, antiquated dresses and playing “house” with their dolls in a primitive setting, expressionless and practically drooping with boredom. The problem with these dolls is that girls “could only ever play at being mothers, which can be fun” – Mirren pauses meaningfully – “for a while.” Then, she adds, her tone turning cynical, “Ask your mother.” The appeal of motherhood, Mirren seems to suggest, eventually morphs into unwanted drudgery – a reality underscored moments later when the girls meet their first Barbie, who towers above them, larger than life, inspiring them to smash their mundane baby dolls.
Barbie – a doll of a young, beautiful woman – compels kids to leave the ennui of motherhood behind for the pink plastic sparkle of Barbieland, where all the Barbies live their best lives forever, embodying feminine perfection and possibility.Advertisement
The framing of motherhood as thankless and undesirable echoes mid-20th-century feminist critiques of child rearing and housework. These roles not only bound women to the home but also forced them to perform repetitive tasks that didn’t reflect their abilities and derailed their ambitions.
In her 1949 book “The Second Sex,” French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir argued that women, to empower themselves, needed to reject the myth that motherhood represented the pinnacle of feminine achievement. American writer Betty Friedan would echo this sentiment in her 1963 book “The Feminine Mystique,” railing against the image of the “happy housewife heroine” who finds fulfillment in being a wife and mother.
It’s no coincidence that these ideas overlapped with the invention of Barbie in 1959. While predating the women’s movement of the 1960s and 1970s, Barbie’s creator, Ruth Handler, did design the toy to allow girls to imagine their future adult selves, rather than simply play-acting as mothers using baby dolls.
The value in ‘motherwork’
And yet, not only do many women enjoy being mothers, but motherhood also plays an essential role in society and life.Advertisement
In her 1976 book “Of Woman Born,” feminist poet Adrienne Rich draws a distinction between the fulfilling relationship mothers can have with their children and the patriarchal institution of motherhood, which keeps women under men’s control.
Sociologist Patricia Hill Collins coined the term “motherwork” in the mid-1990s to highlight the experiences of women of color and working-class mothers, many of whom don’t have the resources to pursue their own ambitions over caring for their families and communities. When you’re just trying to navigate the day-to-day without wealth or other forms of privilege, options like hiring a nanny or paying for graduate school aren’t feasible or a priority.
For these mothers, the survival of their children is not a given. Instead of tedium and oppression, motherwork acknowledges that mothering can be a radically important labor of love and a source of empowerment in its own right.
In “Barbie,” the mother-daughter relationship between Gloria, played by America Ferrera, and her daughter Sasha, played by Ariana Greenblatt, contains these contradictions.Advertisement
After experiencing a vision of the person whose sadness seems to be the source of her malfunctions, Stereotypical Barbie initially assumes it’s Sasha’s tween angst that’s disturbed the perfection of Barbieland and drawn her into the real world. Instead, Barbie discovers it’s Gloria’s loneliness – and her nostalgia for a simpler time when she played Barbies with her daughter – that has caused the rift between reality and fantasy.
Sasha and Gloria’s adventure with Barbie – first escaping the Mattel executives who want to lock Barbie in a box and then journeying back to Barbieland to rescue the other Barbies from the Kens, who are trying to take over – repairs the relationship between mother and daughter.
Gloria remembers what it’s like to find joy in motherhood, and Sasha realizes that her mother isn’t just a bland set of values against which to rebel. Gloria is a fully fledged person with a rich inner life who, by her own estimation, is sometimes “weird and dark and crazy,” which Sasha admires.
Sasha – and all the Barbies – have something else to learn from Gloria, too.Advertisement
Stunned that even someone as perfect as Barbie feels like she’s not good enough, Gloria delivers a poignant monologue encapsulating, in Barbie’s words, “the cognitive dissonance required to be a woman under patriarchy.” Gloria, as a mom struggling to reconcile her deep love for her child with the fear that she’s constantly failing at motherhood, knows all too well how this cognitive dissonance wears women down.
Letting go
In her 2018 book “Mothers: An Essay on Love and Cruelty,” scholar Jacqueline Rose argues that motherhood is tied to notions of citizenship and nation and, for this reason, can become “the ultimate scapegoat for our personal and political failings.” The ending to “Barbie” rejects the notion that mothers are to blame for their children’s mistakes. Instead, the film offers another perspective through the character of Ruth Handler, Mattel’s founder, who’s played by Rhea Perlman. Handler helps Barbie see what awaits her if she chooses to become human.
Symbolically letting go of her creation and encouraging her to forge her own path, Ruth tells Barbie that she cannot control her any more than she could control her own daughter, and that mothers should pave the way for their children, not hinder them.
“We mothers,” she explains, “stand still so our daughters can look back to see how far they’ve come.” This sentimental and self-effacing message seems at odds with the film’s nuanced portrayal of motherhood through humor and critique.Advertisement
But, throughout, “Barbie” invites viewers to question even its own structure, tenets and messaging – and presents multiple perspectives on motherhood.
Mothering is hard work and sometimes may even be thankless labour. It may bore or disappoint. It can be affirming or heartbreaking or both. It involves leading and following, holding on and letting go.

Being a mother shouldn’t have to be about sacrifice or about fitting some impossible ideal. Instead, motherhood can highlight the possibilities of living in – and with – the contradictions.

Comforting Mothers On The Go: Himalaya Wellness Company Takes a Stand to Support a Mother’s JourneyPremium Story,"Breastfeeding offers a profoundly rewarding experience for both mother and child, fostering a natural and vital bond between them while providing numerous health benefits. However, as per the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5), the exclusive breastfeeding rate in India is 55.1% only. While breastfeeding is a crucial aspect of maternal and child health in India, it can be daunting for new mothers in India. One of the key challenges that mothers face is finding suitable spaces for comfortable public breastfeeding. 
Acknowledging this need, Himalaya BabyCare has proactively supported breastfeeding mothers with dedicated spaces driven by their commitment to ensuring the best care for babies and a hassle-free and worry-free experience for moms. Himalaya BabyCare has established 184 breastfeeding rooms across various locations in India. These feeding rooms have touched the lives of two million mothers so far, providing them with a safe and comfortable environment to nourish and care for their babies in public spaces. The initiative stems from the often-unacknowledged fact that breastfeeding on the move can be challenging for new mothers. 
According to WHO, breast milk plays a crucial role as the exclusive nutrient source for children up to 6 months, supplies over half of a child’s energy needs from 6 to 12 months, and about one-third between 12 and 24 months. Breastmilk holds significant importance as a vital source of energy and essential nutrients, particularly during illness, contributing to the reduction in mortality rates. Breastfeeding also benefits mothers, reducing the risk of ovarian and breast cancer. Advertisement
 Himalaya Wellness Company Takes a Stand to Support a Mother’s Journey
According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, breastfeeding serves as a source of comfort and normalcy for the baby, especially when their regular routines are disturbed while traveling. Breast milk provides perfect nutrition and hydration for infants, along with essential immune factors, and is the ideal food for babies. These facts highlight the natural and vital role of breastfeeding in promoting the health and well-being of both the baby and the mother. 
Despite it’s known significance, breastfeeding in public remains a challenge for many women worldwide. By creating designated nursing spaces, we can work towards promoting breastfeeding and ensuring a comfortable and relaxing experience for mothers and babies while commuting, traveling, or out of the home. Himalaya has taken significant steps in advocating for and supporting breastfeeding mothers by equipping 22 airports with 146 baby care rooms, 14 railway stations with 20 baby care rooms, 5 hospitals with 14 baby care rooms, and a mall with 4 baby care rooms. 
Himalaya Wellness Company continues to be the driving force in empowering and supporting breastfeeding mothers from all walks of life by providing essential resources for the well-being of their babies and themselves. Himalaya reinforces its commitment to the health and happiness of both mother and child, contributing to a healthier and more supportive breastfeeding environment in India. Himalaya provides strong support and encouragement to breastfeeding mothers in India by creating these nurturing spaces across country.",parenting
Little sleep can take toll on health of both mother and child: Study,"A new study has analyzed maternal and infant sleep patterns, identifying predictors and provided recommendations for instilling healthy habits. The study was published in the journal, “Journal of Developmental & Behavioral Pediatrics”.
The first two years is a really critical period where a lot of development is going on, and sleep is important for health. We wanted to look at the association of mother and infant sleep and whether it changes over time, said Tianying Cai, now a postdoctoral researcher at Northwestern University.
We identified two distinct groups, a low maternal sleep group where the mothers get 5 to 6 hours of sleep per night, and an average maternal sleep group, which meets the national recommended sleep guidelines with 7 to 8 hours per night. Children in the low maternal sleep group also slept less, although the difference was as large as for the mothers, Cai stated. The research team followed parents of 464 infants in the first two years of life. Mothers completed surveys about bedtime routines, their child’s sleep duration, nighttime waking, and sleep problems at 3, 12, 18, and 24 months of age.Advertisement
The families were part of STRONG Kids 2, a program at the U. of I. that promotes nutrition and healthy habits in families with young children. STRONG Kids 2 co-directors, Barbara Fiese, professor emerita of HDFS, and Sharon Donovan, professor of food science and human nutrition, also contributed to the study.
Mothers who fit the low maternal sleep profile got an average of 5.74 hours of sleep per night at 3 months and 5.9 hours at 12 to 24 months, while their children got 9.6 and 10.52 hours, respectively. In the average sleep profile, mothers got 7.31 hours at 3 months and 7.28 hours at 12 to 24 months, while child sleep averaged 9.99 hours at 3 months and 11 hours at 12 to 24 months.
The research team also identified factors that influence the amount of sleep a mother gets. Not surprisingly, one of the strongest predictors is infant-signaled nighttime waking, which means the infant is more likely to alert the parent at night. This could be either because these infants woke more frequently, or because the mothers were more likely to wake up when infants stirred, Cai noted.
Mothers who had longer employment hours were more likely to be in the low sleep group at 3 months, although that was no longer a factor by 12 months. Furthermore, those who breastfed their infant at 12 months were more likely to be in the average sleep group.Advertisement
Over time, many families transitioned from the low to the average sleep group as infant sleep patterns consolidated. At 3 months, 60 per cent were in the low maternal sleep group and 40 per cent were in the average group, while at 12 months the numbers were reversed. Most of those who were in the average sleep group at 3 months continued to be so throughout the study period.
The researchers found that an earlier bedtime and consistent routines were associated with better sleep patterns, corroborating a previous study from Fiese and Cai. If parents can establish early bedtime routines at three months, it improves sleep duration and reduces sleep problems, Fiese said. Parents may feel overwhelmed and don’t realize that they have this in their toolkit. Something as simple as setting a regular bedtime early on and having routines, like reading a story to your child before they go to bed. You may not think they’re understanding, but the rhythm of your voice establishes predictability, and you can expand this bedtime routine over the first few years of life. The researchers noted they did not observe any significant differences due to demographic characteristics in the sample.
Maternal education, income, or ethnicity did not predict sleep group memberships across 3 to 24 months; all parents were facing similar challenges. I think having a baby is a great equalizer for a lot of things, although moms who have to go back to work or work longer hours may have more pressures, Donovan said.
Even so, there are steps everyone can take to improve bedtime habits and sleep patterns.Advertisement

Getting kids to bed earlier and trying to meet the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines is really important because studies have shown that sleep is associated with a lot of neurocognitive outcomes and health in kids.

Common viruses which cause flu are influenza virus, parainfluenza viruses, Adenovirus, RSV etc.
Flu is very common in school going children, it spreads from one person to another by contact, droplet or aerosol methods. Commonly flu manifests as running nose high-grade fever, cough, eyes-redness, headache and body bodyache. Usually, it takes about 3 to 5 days for the child to recover from the Flu.
Sometimes it can lead to complications such as viral pneumonia or bronchiolitis, where the child can have fast breathing, low saturations, drowsiness, poor intake, may require hospital admission and sometimes ICU care.
Management of children with flu includes using paracetamol for fever, steam inhalation, rest, avoiding sending them to school, good hydration and nutritious food. If a child goes to school with Flu, he/she may infect other kids or he/she may get secondary viral or bacterial infection, so it is highly recommended to avoid schooling during flu.
It is also important to monitor for complications like if the child is not accepting orally, having fast breathing and drowsiness it is better to go to nearby hospital and consult a pediatrician.
It is always said that prevention is better than cure, so what are all the preventive steps we need to take against Flu?
First avoid sending to school when a child is having the Flu. Secondly, maintain good hand hygiene and wear a mask like in the Covid time. Thirdly, using appropriate medication during illness, avoid self-medication and self-antibiotic usage.
Fourth, take flu shots yearly as recommended by the pediatrician.
Let us address common myths regarding flu.

Giving milk increases chest congestion? No, in Flu milk can be given as the child will not accept other food so giving milk will maintain nutrition and hydration.
Fruits should not be given during the flu? No, all fruits can be given during the flu.
Should children not be given a bath during the flu? No, a bath can be given.
Flu can happen only once in a year? No, flu can happen more than once in a year, school going kids can have 5 to 6 episodes of flu in a year as each time infective agent may be different viruses.
Giving a yearly flu vaccine weakens the immunity of the child? No, giving flu vaccines yearly with new strains will boost immunity against the new strains.

Out of our heads and into our livesPremium Story,"“We are living too much in our heads and not really living our lives!” This remark by a young person has stayed with me as I deeply resonated with her words. Human suffering has stemmed so much from how we internalise the pressures and measures of our society and the vicious loop of overthinking. The pandemic has obviously cranked it a notch higher with the uncertainty of the 2020s, the spiralling death toll of 2021s, then a slow attempt at limping back in the 2022s and the coming to terms with our loss that still continues in the 2023s. Though many of us were not at the receiving end of its brutal impact, we carry the memories and images of the exodus of the migrant workers, the funeral pyres lining the roads, the relentless search for hospital beds and sleepless nights of the dreaded, “Who next?”
While we had been enduring this, our minds have been clocking it all in and trying to do what it is designed to do -– speeding up thinking as a way of survival. And getting us more knotted up than ever before, churning, chattering and chomping our peace of mind.
Through numerous conversations on overthinking, three themes have stood out:Advertisement
We cannot think our way out of it: Fifteen-year-old Shiv described overthinking as “hyper-buzz” which “started as a seed of an idea and the more I think, problem-solve or analyse it, the stronger it roots itself.” Shiv explained it as having a loud voice which constantly compared him to others, criticised him and attacked his worth: “You are so lazy and not good at anything!” It would also push certain dark predictions about his future: “You will fail your board exams and never get into any college. You are a total failure.”
It is not about us: The voice of “hyper buzz” had become so loud and convincing that when I met Shiv, he had internalised it and it had led him to believe “I am worthless”, alienating himself from his friends; “They are better off without me”, and robbing him of his sense of agency; “What’s the point? I am going to fail anyway.” He stopped attending school and would keep himself shut in his room where he would sit for hours trying to “numb the hyper buzz” with video games.If we pay attention to the workings of overthinking, one thing stands out – it inflicts society’s agenda of perfection, productivity and performance on us. We internalise this agenda, believe it as truth and beat ourselves for not measuring up.
The fight is futile: It is like being caught in a metaphorical quicksand and the more we get into trying to lash our way out of it, the more stuck we get. Suppose I asked you to sit quietly and not overthink the problem you have been struggling with recently. What would happen? You are right! In the next 10 minutes, there would be a battleground raging inside you, leaving you more exhausted and entrenched in overthinking. Shiv explained this “hyper buzz” as a well-meaning overworked teacher who has to make you follow society’s curriculum to protect you from shame, misery and failure. Telling the teacher to shut up will just crank up its voice even further.
People have found respite from overthinking through meditation, yoga, mindfulness etc. Here are some innovative, unconventional ideas children and young people have found as a way to dispel it:Advertisement
Curiosity: Next time overthinking shows up, observe it from all angles. Where does it show up in the body? How would you describe the sensation — hot, cold, heavy, piercing, front, back, left, right? What happens when you gently breathe into it until it feels lighter? After checking for the sensation, if overthinking does not step away, ask some questions to see through some of its tricks — what is it trying to convince me of? What is it pushing me to believe about myself, or the world? How is it comparing me to others? What predictions is it trying to make about the future? The more curious we get, the more we are able to distance ourselves from the overthinking swamp.
Compassion: One day Shiv came in with a smile and told me that he had started “hugging hyper-buzz demon.” He explained that he had learned to be alert to the earliest signs that it was creeping up on him, breathe out and turn to it with compassionate curiosity. Maybe you could try the ABC approach in your life: be Alert to the early signs of overthinking, Breathe in and out a few times deeply (maybe put a gentle hand on the sensation that is showing up) and invite Compassionate curiosity. How long has it been around for? How is it trying to serve you or protect you? What would look like if rather than taking an adversarial position, you could hug the overworked teacher, thank them for their relentless services but maybe let them know that they can retire now?
Playfulness: All Harry Potter fans know that Riddikulus is a spell used against boggarts. A boggart is a shape-shifter that feeds on fear and is dispelled by laughter. To get rid of it, the caster has to think of something outrageously funny and ridiculous. For example, Saanvi was struggling with what she called “brain churn”, which convinced her that she would be fired for messing up her work. So we tried a little experiment — Saanvi tried to visualise the “brain-churn” as a cartoon like figure, which would get up and start a full-on tantrum — flinging and kicking on the ground, changing colours, dancing to Bollywood music. Every time “brain-churn” tuned up, Saanvi was quick to add a dash of humour, laughter and playfulness into the mix and see it quickly dissolve. Now, it is your turn to give shape and voice to the overthinking that is pestering you. Amplify and make it as ridiculous as possible until it dissolves.
Humankind has been through immense hardships, pain, and losses in the last three years. My conversations with children have really helped me “get out of my head” through dollops of curiosity, compassion and playfulness. What a great recipe for living our lives!Advertisement

How to take care of your baby’s skin this monsoonPremium Story,"Monsoon is hard on everyone’s skin, especially babies. According to dermatologist Aanchal Panth, during this season, kids tend to develop fungal infections, so taking care of the skin is important. Sweat dermatitis can also be seen due to excessive sweat logging.
Dr Gauri Padmawar, Dermatologist at Ruby Hall Clinic, recommended avoiding standing in direct sunlight with your baby and smartly dressing them so that they feel well-ventilated. “Keep them well hydrated and use plenty of baby-safe sunscreen,” she said.
Panth advised against bathing them with hot water as that can strip their skin off its natural oils, instead use lukewarm water. She also suggested using thin clean cotton towels to wipe. “Dab, don’t rub.”Advertisement
Padmawar stressed the importance of investing in a wide-brimmed hat and planning your outdoor activities carefully.

Here are some tips to keep in mind to protect your baby’s skin.
Giving a bath each day is not recommended
According to Padmawar, it is not suggested to give your babies a bath every single day. Panth, too recommended, avoiding long baths if skin is dry.
Don’t forget to use warm water, but avoid water hot enough to burn, which will strip their skin. Additionally, remember to wipe their bodies‘ folds like armpits and groin properly after bath, Panth added.
Don’t forget to moisturiseAdvertisement
Panth advised applying a thin layer of moisture after bathing your babies to keep their skin healthy and moisturised. But she said to avoid oil massages in summertime, or even hot oil massages.
Consistently change diapers
It is always recommended to change your babies’ diapers consistently, according to Padmawar. Doing that will ensure hygiene and protect their skin, especially if you’ve moisturised it properly. Usage of tight diapers must be avoided, she added.
Don’t use scented products
Padmawar noted that scented products are dangerous for your babies’ skin and must be avoided. You can use unscented powders and moisturisers. But Panth said to remember that powders must be used sparingly, and you must make sure they are not inhaled.

MIND diet linked with better focus in school-aged children: StudyPremium Story,"A recent study suggests that a diet created to help prevent cognitive decline in adults may also increase attention in preadolescents. The findings may benefit future nutritional programmes aiming to enhance children’s cognition.
The latest research studied two dietary patterns–the heart-healthy Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet, which combines the Mediterranean diet with the heart-healthy Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, and the Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015), which is based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
“We assessed how adherence to these diets was associated with children’s attentional inhibition–the ability to resist distracting stimuli–and found that only the MIND diet was positively linked with children’s performance on a task assessing attentional inhibition,” said Shelby Keye, PhD, who performed the work as a doctoral student in the Department of Kinesiology and Community Health at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.Advertisement
“This suggests that the MIND diet could potentially improve children’s cognitive development, which is important for success in school,” she said.
Much like the Mediterranean and DASH diets on which it is based, the MIND diet includes recommendations for specific foods, such as fresh fruit, leafy greens and legumes, which promote brain health. Previously, the MIND diet has been shown to impact adults positively, but very few studies have been performed on children.
The new research used data collected by a previous cross-sectional study that observed 85 participants from 7 to 11 years of age who completed a seven-day diet record, from which HEI-2015 and the MIND diet scores were calculated.
To examine attentional inhibition, participants were also required to complete a task that needed spatial attention and executive control, with their reaction time and accuracy recorded. Children with neurological disorders were excluded to reduce confounding factors from the study.Advertisement
The researchers discovered that the MIND diet scores only positively correlated with study participants’ accuracy on the task, meaning that those who followed the MIND diet performed better. However, the researchers noted that an intervention study is necessary to make any causal inferences.
Next, the researchers would like to examine the relationship between the MIND diet and different age groups of children to determine if the developmental effect is involved.
What is MIND diet?

According to Dr Ajay Aggarwal, Director – Internal Medicine, Fortis Hospital, Noida, the MIND diet is a hybrid of the Mediterranean diet and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet (DASH). The diet recommends incorporating leafy green vegetables, non-starchy veggies, berries, nuts, olive oil, fish, poultry, eggs, beans and legumes in food.
The MIND diet has various health benefits. “It contributes to brain health through its food components that have antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Vitamin E and antioxidants found in green leafy vegetables and nuts protect neurons from damage related to oxidative stress caused by free radicals. In animal models, berries consumption has been shown to increase neurogenesis, insulin-like growth factor-1 signalling and reverse neuronal ageing by reducing oxidative stress,” Dr Aggarwal said.Advertisement
A cross-sectional study demonstrated that lower adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with increased atrophy on the specific brain regions for Alzheimer’s disease,” Dr Aggarwal added.
Although originally designed to help ward off cognitive decline in adults, the expert noted that it might also help improve attention in preadolescents. Adherence to the MIND diet is associated with children’s attentional inhibition — the ability to resist distracting stimuli.
However, Dr Aggarwal highlighted that the casual relationship between dietary patterns and children’s attention span required stronger evidence. Moreover, the lack of specific guidelines on applying the MIND diet in their daily lives makes it challenging for individuals in meal planning and adherence.
Additionally, the expert said you must modify the diet to accommodate your needs if you have allergies or intolerances to specific foods emphasised in the MIND diet, such as nuts, fish or dairy.Advertisement
“ALSO | “Healthy
“For example, individuals with kidney issues may need to limit their potassium intake, which is typically high in the MIND diet due to its emphasis on fruits and vegetables. Meanwhile, pregnant or breastfeeding women may need additional nutrients not fully covered by the MIND diet,” he said.

What is sustainable parenting? Here’s how to practice itPremium Story,"Sustainable parenting has gained popularity in recent years as individuals have become more aware of the negative impact of human activities on the environment. While it is important to undertake eco-friendly practices, it is also essential to raise our children with the same mindset.
Also referred to as green parenting, sustainable parenting is a conscious effort to raise children in an environmentally conscious manner. This means instilling values of sustainability in our kids, making them understand the importance of living sustainably and helping them develop eco-friendly habits.
What better way to teach your children to practice sustainability than doing it yourself? After all, children learn best when parents set a strong example in front of them.Advertisement
“As parents, we want to make the best choices for our children and the planet they inherit. At the heart of sustainable parenting lies a profound understanding of the interconnectedness between us, our children and the environment. It begins with conscious choices that reflect our commitment to preserving the delicate balance of nature,” Pallavi Utagi, CEO and Founder, SuperBottoms told indianexpress.com.
Here are 5 tips to be a sustainable parent, according to the expert:
Embrace conscious consumption
Sustainable parenting begins with mindful consumption and conscious choices. Instead of accumulating excessive toys and gadgets that have a limited life span — prioritise quality items that are built to last.
Look for products made from sustainable materials like organic cotton or eco-friendly plastics. When it comes to diapers, go the guilt-free diapering route by embracing cloth diapers as a conscious option, which are good for the baby and the planet — eliminating the need to dispose diapers.Advertisement
We impart valuable lessons to our children about the importance of thoughtful choices and their impact on the environment by making conscious decisions as consumers.
Reduce, reuse, recycle
The three Rs of sustainability hold immense power in parenting. Reduce waste by avoiding single-use items whenever possible. Opt for reusable alternatives like cloth diapers, which not only benefit your baby’s comfort but also minimise environmental impact. Reuse items creatively — from repurposing containers for storage to passing down clothes and toys to younger siblings or friends. Finally, recycle and upcycle diligently to ensure that materials are given a new life rather than ending up in landfills.
Go green in the kitchen
To promote sustainable parenting, it is essential to instill environmentally conscious habits in children — starting from the heart of the home — the kitchen.
Encourage the selection of organic and locally sourced food whenever possible — teaching your children the significance of sustainable agriculture and the advantages of consuming fresh, whole foods.Advertisement
Inculcate the practice of minimising food waste by planning meals efficiently, composting food scraps and finding creative ways to utilise leftovers. Promote the use of eco-friendly kitchenware such as reusable silicone food storage bags and stainless-steel lunch boxes as alternatives to disposable plastic spoons and straws.
Connect with nature

Encourage your children to care for plants and nurture their growth. Teach them about nature and sustainability by spending time outdoors and engaging in outdoor activities such as gardening and hiking.
Show them the importance of conserving biodiversity and how their actions can make a positive impact. By instilling a love for nature — we raise responsible stewards of the Earth who understand the value of sustainability.
Teach the power of conscious choices
Sustainable parenting involves educating our children about the impact of their choices. Discuss environmental issues such as climate change and pollution in an age-appropriate manner.Advertisement

Dengue fever is spread by the Aedes aegyptyi mosquito which breeds in stagnant water. During rainfall or floods, water accumulates in various (often innocuous) spaces, providing an ideal place for mosquitoes to breed. 
Delhi has already seen an uptick in the number of cases of dengue. As of July 8th, a total of 136 cases of dengue have been reported in Delhi, with a significant proportion affecting children.
Last year, a staggering 2,33,251 cases of dengue were reported from India according to the National Centre for Vector-borne Diseases Control (NVBVDC) 2022 report of which there were more than 303 deaths. Delhi itself recorded 10,183 cases and 9 fatalities in the same period
Children because of their delicate physiology are more prone to the dangerous effects of dengue and the disease can progress rapidly from fever to dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome which can have fatal consequences. 
Children often present with high fever, headache and body ache. With development of complications like low platelet counts, they can have bleeding from the nose, gums, intestines, breathing difficulty, swelling of the hands, face, feet and low blood pressure. These symptoms represent a critical situation and must be treated promptly. Any child with fever must be shown to a doctor well in time to ensure early diagnosis and intervention in case of complications. 
Do’s and don’ts:

Eliminate water logging in and around the house- water can stagnate in coolers, pots, receptacles, water tanks etc and provide the ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes. Their regular drainage and the use of larcvicidal chemicals will prevent mosquito breeding
Personal protection- use mosquito nets (preferably treated with insecticide) on beds
Use window and door screens to prevent entry of mosquitoes into the house
Reduce outdoor activity. The aedes mosquito is most active during the mornings and evenings. Avoid outdoor activities during these times.
Protect your skin from bites by using long sleeved clothes and use a proprietary mosquito repellant. Choose repellents that contain ingredients like DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus for effective protection.
A person who develops fever, particularly if it is high, and associated with body ache, headache, eyeball pain should immediately consult a doctor.  The use of certain fever medications can be associated with complications in dengue and should be taken only with the advice of the doctor
Take plenty of oral fluids like water, fresh juice, soups, ORS, coconut water to maintain adequate hydration 
Keep in mind certain serious danger signs like persistent vomiting, breathlessness, extreme lethargy, poor urine output, bleeding from any part of the body and unconsciousness which would necessitate immediate treatment.

Relieves stress
Music makes children feel calm and relaxed. Happy hormones are released when we play or listen to music.Advertisement
In a similar vein, Prakriti Poddar, Global Head, Mental Health & Wellbeing, RoundGlass Living said, “Playing musical instruments has been associated with feelings of self-expression, creativity, perseverance and higher confidence levels. Researchers have found that playing a musical instrument can switch off the stress response–improving physical and emotional health.”
Sense of achievement
Being able to play a piece of music all on their own will make them feel proud of themselves.
Additionally, Poddar said, “Possessing the skills to play an instrument gives them a social edge. They can play in bands, participate in school competitions or just liven up a birthday party. By being in a band, children learn teamwork, and this improves their social connections and skills.”
Teaches patience
Playing a musical instrument cultivates patience because it takes time to master the skill.Advertisement
Concurring, Poddar explained, “Learning to play a musical instrument takes time, patience and a lot of practice. This inculcates a sense of hard work, discipline and perseverance in children. Additionally, playing a musical instrument involves taking care of it. For example, tuning the guitar strings or tuning the piano keys. This helps nurture a sense of ownership in children, which makes them more responsible.”
Boosts memory and coordination
Playing an instrument requires multiple parts of the brain to function together and remember things.
“Learning a musical instrument can help children improve their motor skills, and mathematical skills (string instruments teach them division and fractions through chords, beats, octaves etc), and reading musical notes and playing them on an instrument can help improve their memory and listening skills,” said Poddar.
Encourages self-expression
Children who learn to play an instrument have an outlet for creativity and making their own choices.Advertisement

Adding, Poddar said, “Being able to play a musical instrument also makes children more self-aware. This means they are able to express themselves better and more creatively.”

Ayurvedic skincare for children: Things parents must keep in mindPremium Story,"There is no parent who does not want to offer the best to their children–whether it is in terms of their education, health or nutrition. As ancient wisdom, Ayurveda can help parents support their child’s health.
The benefits of Ayurveda extend to the skin as well. Ayurvedic skincare is based on ancient Indian medicine and addresses skin conditions by treating the underlying causes. According to Shreedha Singh, co-founder of The Ayurveda Co., Ayurvedic acharyas advise parents to start caring for their children’s skin from infancy.
Among these Ayurvedic practices, the Ayurvedic tradition of abhyanga or oil massage– holds great significance. “This practice is known for its vatahara properties, which help balance and pacify the vata dosha–closely associated with the nervous system. Regularly massaging the child’s body with particular attention given to areas like the head, ears and feet, is believed to increase the secretion of human growth hormone (HGH) that plays a vital role in normal growth and development. These massages are also said to reduce stress levels and improve sleep — supporting the proper secretion of hormones necessary for healthy growth,” Singh said.Advertisement
In addition to body massages, Ayurveda emphasises the importance of maintaining cleanliness and practicing appropriate skincare right from birth. “It is recommended to use specifically formulated mild and natural cleansers to keep the child’s skin clean and free from impurities. Furthermore, moisturising the skin with gentle and natural ingredients is encouraged to maintain hydration and nourishment,” Singh explained.

Parents should be mindful of age-appropriate products for their children– understanding that each stage of development requires tailored care, as per Singh. Here is an age-wise list of recommendations:
Infants
During this phase of life, the delicate nature of an infant’s skin demands the utmost care. Ayurveda emphasises the avoidance of products containing harsh chemicals and synthetic additives. Instead, parents are encouraged to opt for samskara shayya (herbal-infused bedding) to provide natural and gentle care for the infant’s skin. Natural cleansers like triphala or herbal decoctions can effectively cleanse the skin without causing any imbalance or irritation.Advertisement
Additionally, employing Ayurvedic oils such as bala tailam can nourish and moisturise the skin, thereby supporting its healthy development.
Toddlers and young children
As children transition into the toddler stage, Ayurvedic teachings emphasise avoiding products containing artificial fragrances, colours and harsh chemicals that may disturb the innate balance of the skin. Instead, incorporating herbal preparations like ubtan (a mixture of herbs and grains) can serve as a gentle cleanser and exfoliator.
Ayurvedic oils like balaashwagandhadi tailam and lakshadi tailam are recommended for moisturisation due to their natural nourishing properties. These oils help maintain skin hydration, impart a healthy glow and provide protection against environmental stressors.
Moreover, adding dashapushpadi (a combination of ten sacred flowers) in skincare preparations can offer soothing effects on the skin– enhancing its vitality and radiance.
Pre-teens and teensAdvertisement
In this age group, Ayurveda advises steering clear of skincare products that contain harsh chemicals, synthetic fragrances and artificial additives. Instead, herbal pastes or masks incorporating potent ingredients like chandan (sandalwood), nimba (neem), haridra (turmeric), and dashapushpadi (a combination of ten sacred flowers) can be introduced. These natural ingredients possess cooling, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and nourishing properties– promoting optimal skin health and radiance while preserving its integrity.
Dos and don’ts of children’s skincare

Singh highlighted that one must bear in mind that skincare routine of kids may vary from that of adults.
Dos:
*Use gentle cleansers: Opt for natural cleansers such as triphala or herbal decoctions to cleanse the skin without causing imbalance or irritation.
*Embrace herbal preparations: Incorporate ubtan— a mixture of herbs and grains as a gentle cleanser and exfoliator to remove impurities and promote healthy skin.
*Nourish with Ayurvedic oils: Moisturise the skin using Ayurvedic oils like lakshadi tailam and Balaashwagandhadi tailam to provide hydration, enhance skin radiance and protect against environmental stressors.

Don’ts:Advertisement
*Avoid harsh chemicals: Steer clear of skincare products that contain harsh chemicals, synthetic fragrances and artificial additives as they can disrupt the skin’s natural balance and potentially harm it.
*Minimise synthetic fragrances: Synthetic fragrances can irritate the skin and disturb its natural equilibrium. Opt for products with natural scents or choose fragrance-free options.
*Say no to artificial colours: Products with artificial colours should be avoided as they can adversely affect the skin — particularly for children with sensitive skin.
*Steer clear of harsh exfoliants: Avoid abrasive exfoliants that can damage children’s delicate skin. Opt for gentle exfoliation methods like ubtan to promote skin health without causing harm.

Take Time: Signs and symptoms of low self-esteem in your childPremium Story,"Low self-esteem is a terminology used when someone lacks confidence about who they are and what they can do. They often feel incompetent, unloved, or inadequate. People who struggle with low self-esteem are consistently afraid about making mistakes or letting other people down.
Having self-esteem issues can be detrimental to your health and negatively affect your personal and professional relationships. There are many reasons why you may have low self-esteem — your genes, how and where you grew up, and other life circumstances all play a role.
Poor Confidence
Being confident in yourself and your abilities allows you to know that you can rely on yourself to manage different situations. This self-trust means that you feel comfortable and confident navigating many different things you might encounter in life, which can play an important role in your being. Individuals with low self-esteem have less confidence in themselves.
Lack of ControlAdvertisement
People who have low self-esteem often feel that they have little control over their lives or what happens to them. This can be due to the feeling that they have little ability to create changes in themselves or in the world. Because they have an external locus of control, they feel powerless to do anything to fix their problems.
ALSO READ | Anxiety can look different in children. Here’s what to look for and some treatments to consider
Negative Social Comparison
Social comparison can sometimes serve a positive function and enhance a person’s sense of self. But comparing yourself to others can also damage self-esteem. People with low self-esteem may be more likely to engage in what is known as upward social comparison, or comparing themselves to people who they think are better than themselves.
Social media can also play a role in such comparisons, contributing to low self-esteem. If you often compare yourself unfavourably to people on social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram, your self-esteem may take a hit.
Problems Asking for What You NeedAdvertisement
When a person has low self-esteem, they may struggle to ask for what they need. This can come from a feeling of embarrassment. Or you may feel that a need for assistance and support is a sign that you are incompetent.
Worry and Self-Doubt
Even after making a decision, people who have low self-worth often worry that they have made the wrong choice. They doubt their own opinions and may defer to what others think instead of sticking to their choices. This can lead to a great deal of second-guessing and self-doubt. This makes it harder for people with low self-esteem to make decisions about their lives.
Trouble Accepting Positive Feedback
Positive feedback is often met with suspicion and distrust. Complimentary words do not align with their beliefs about themselves, so people with self-esteem issues may feel that the other person is being flippant or even cruel. As they don’t have a positive opinion about themselves, people who have low self-esteem find it difficult to accept compliments from others.
Negative Self-Talk
Low self-esteem causes people to focus on their flaws rather than their strengths. Rather than build themselves up with positive self-talk, they always seem to have something negative to say about themselves, engaging in negative self-talk instead. When things go wrong, people with low self-esteem often blame themselves. They find fault with some aspect of themselves, whether it is their appearance, their personality, or their abilities.
Fear of FailureAdvertisement
People with low self-esteem doubt their ability to achieve success as they fear failure, they tend to either avoid challenges or give up quickly without really trying. This fear of failure can be seen in behaviours such as acting out when things go wrong or looking for ways to hide feelings of inadequacy. People with low self-esteem might also make excuses, blame external factors, or try to downplay the importance of the task.

Poor Outlook
Low self-worth can cause people to feel that there is little chance that the future will be any better than the present. These feelings of hopelessness can make it hard for people with low self-esteem to engage in behaviours that will bring about positive changes in their lives. Self-sabotage is a common way of coping with such feelings. By finding obstacles to prevent success, people with low self-esteem are able to find something else to blame for not achieving their goals or finding greater levels of happiness in their lives.
Lack of Boundaries
The ability to set boundaries is often established early in life. Children with caregivers who show them that they are respected and valued are better able to create good boundaries in adult relationships. They are also more likely to have a more positive view of themselves in general.Advertisement
People with low self-esteem can have a difficult time setting boundaries with others. They may feel guilty or fear that people will stop liking them if they try to establish or maintain a boundary.
Trying to Please Others
People-pleasing is another common symptom of low self-esteem. In order to gain external validation, people who don’t feel good about themselves may go above and beyond to make sure that others are comfortable and happy. Pleasing others often involves neglecting their own needs.
A major factor of low self-esteem, however, comes from your own mental state. Your inner voice, or the thoughts in your head, can be constantly telling you that you are not good enough or worth anything, even if there is evidence to the contrary. Negative thinking in general is linked to low self-worth and low self-esteem.

Seizures in young kids: Things parents should keep in mindPremium Story,"There are various reasons why young children may experience seizures. According to Dr Sanjay Vhora, Neurosurgeon at Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune, any injuries during pregnancy or delivery would cause brain injury which will lead to convulsions or seizures in children. Any tumour in the young ones could also be the cause of convulsion.
Dr Bimal Prasad Padhy, Consultant – Neurology, CARE Hospitals, Nampally, Hyderabad, attributed seizures in young children to brain infections or inflammation, injuries or trauma, or epilepsy.
“Febrile seizures could also be the cause, which occur in association with a high fever, often seen in children between 6 months and 5 years of age. Though most febrile seizures are harmless and occur due to the rapid rise in body temperature,” Dr Padhy said.Advertisement
Signs and symptoms of seizures in young children
These symptoms may vary depending on the type of seizure, according to Dr Padhy. These include:
*Loss of consciousness or altered awareness
*Involuntary movements, such as jerking of limbs
*Staring spells or vacant episodes
*Rapid eye blinking or eye rolling
*Strange or repetitive behaviors
*Unusual sounds or vocalizations
*Loss of bladder or bowel control
*Fatigue or sleepiness after the seizure
*May have prodermal symptoms like burning smell or smell of different things, suggestive of aura before convulsion.
It’s important to note that not all episodes of altered behavior or movements are seizures, according to Dr Padhy. “Some children may exhibit behaviors that resemble seizures but have different causes, such as breath-holding spells or night terrors. Consulting a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis is crucial,” he added.
 During febrile seizures, focus on fever management by using appropriate antipyretic medications as recommended by a healthcare provider. (Source: Freepik)
How to prevent them?
Preventing seizures in young children depends on the underlying cause. Some preventive measures, according to Dr Padhy, that may help include:Advertisement
*Ensuring a safe environment: Minimize potential hazards and create a safe living environment for the child.
*Proper medical care: Follow regular check-ups and vaccinations recommended by healthcare professionals to prevent infections and other illnesses that may trigger seizures.
*Managing fever: During febrile seizures, focus on fever management by using appropriate antipyretic medications as recommended by a healthcare provider.

How to provide first aid?
If you witness a young child having a seizure, it’s important to stay calm, and take the following steps for first aid, as per Dr Padhy:
*Ensure the child’s safety: Clear the area around the child of any objects that may pose a risk of injury.
*Do not restrain the child: Allow the seizure to run its course and avoid holding the child down or trying to stop the movements.
*Protect the child’s head: If possible, cushion the child’s head with a soft object or pillow to prevent injury.
*Time the seizure: Note the time when the seizure starts and ends. If the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes or if it’s the child’s first seizure, seek emergency medical assistance.
*After the seizure ends: Gently roll the child onto their side to prevent choking on saliva or vomit. Do not put anything in the child’s mouth.
*Comfort the child: Stay with the child and provide reassurance as they recover from the seizure.
Remember, each child’s situation is unique, and treatment should be tailored to their specific needs. Consulting with healthcare professionals specializing in pediatric epilepsy is crucial for appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and ongoing management.Advertisement

Five-year survival rate for children with acute lymphatic leukemia has increased: Study,"In the Netherlands, the most frequent kind of pediatric cancer is acute lymphatic leukemia. Each year, around 110 children are diagnosed with this kind of cancer. The prognosis is bright for many children, but not for all. To enhance survival rates and quality of life for all children with leukemia, the treatment strategy is continually being revised based on new scientific discoveries.
The study results of the ALL-11 treatment protocol, led by researchers at the Princess Maxima Center, were published in the scientific Journal of Clinical Oncology.
The five-year survival rate for all children with acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL) has risen to 94 percent. A study of 800 Dutch youngsters demonstrates this. Modified treatment procedures for four subgroups were investigated in the research. The changes were discovered to have a favourable impact on survival and quality of life.Advertisement
For example, the risk of disease recurrence became as much as three times smaller for children with an aggressive form of leukemia. Said Prof. Dr. Rob Pieters: The five-year survival rate for children with acute lymphatic leukemia has increased dramatically since the 1960s, from zero to 94 percent, but the last steps are the most difficult.
Between April 2012 and July 2020, more than 800 children in the Netherlands were treated according to this protocol. The study looked at the effect of modified treatment in specific groups of children with leukemia, including those with a so-called Ikaros abnormality.
Prof. Dr. Rob Pieters, pediatric oncologist and medical director of the Princess Maxima Center led the clinical study. He says: There is broad interest worldwide in this research, because it was still unknown how to improve therapy for children with Ikaros leukemia. Children with an Ikaros abnormality in the DNA of their leukemia cells are more likely to have their disease return after treatment.
In this study, these children received an additional year of maintenance phase chemotherapy on top of the first two years of treatment. This modification led to a three times lower risk of cancer returning: it only happened in 9% of them, compared to 26% of children in the previous treatment protocol.Advertisement

In the ALL-11 protocol, doctors and researchers also looked at the effect of less intensive treatment for three other groups of children. These included children with a DNA abnormality in their leukemia cells that is associated with a very high cure rate, and children with Down syndrome who suffer a lot of side effects from therapy.
These children were given lower amounts of anthracyclines, a particular type of chemotherapy that increases the risk of heart damage and infections. The modification turned out to be a good choice: the children had the same or even better survival rate while their quality of life improved due to a lower risk of infections and less risk of heart damage.
Prof. Dr. Rob Pieters: The five-year survival rate for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia has increased tremendously since the 1960s, from zero to 94%, but the last steps are the hardest. We are now one step closer to curing all children with ALL. We have also been able to remove a drug that gives risk of heart damage largely from the treatment of children with less aggressive disease. So, the latest results for children with leukemia fit exactly with our mission: more cure, with fewer side effects.’

"Know more about hyperlactation syndrome, the condition that led to woman lactating record-breaking premature babiesPremium Story","A mother of two, Elisabeth Anderson-Sierra, holds the Guinness World record for the largest donation of breastmilk by any individual. The Aloha, Oregon, USA, native donated 1,599.68 litres to a milk bank between 20 February 2015 and 20 June 2018. In the endeavour, she has nourished thousands of children–even helping to save the lives of premature babies.
“This only accounts for milk that I donated to a milk bank between the years of 2015 and 2018,” Elisabeth told Guinness World Records.
Over the past nine years, she has not only donated to local families but has come out in support of recipients globally. Elisabeth estimated the total amount of breastmilk donated to be over 350,000 ounces.Advertisement
She donated to many recipients who have been labelled as “failure to thrive”. “Being able to turn that around and (have) that label removed in so many different stories has just been everything to me,” she said.

“These are the things that I focus on. These are the positives and why I continue doing what I do.”
In one instance, she had helped a premature baby in Puerto Rico. The baby had lost his mother due to childbirth complications and his father had been purchasing breastmilk from a milk bank.
“My husband is Puerto Rican and we had gone to Puerto Rico right after Hurricane Maria,” she said.Advertisement
Elisabeth shared that she has a medical condition known as hyperlactation syndrome, where breastmilk overflow occurs because of increased milk production. “My body creates a lot of the hormone called prolactin and that is what drives milk production,” she said.
According to Dr Ritu Sethi, Director, The Aura Speciality Clinic Gurgaon & Senior Consultant- Gynaecology, Cloud Nine Hospitals, Gurgaon, hyperlactation syndrome, also known as oversupply syndrome or hypergalactia, is a condition where a breastfeeding person produces an excessive amount of breast milk. It is characterised by an overabundance of milk production, which can lead to various challenges and difficulties for both the breastfeeding person and the baby.
 “My body creates a lot of the hormone called prolactin and that is what drives milk production,” she said. (Source: Guinness World Records)
ALSO READ | Breastfeeding is beneficial for both the mother and baby; here’s why
“Symptoms for the mother include breasts that may become uncomfortably full, swollen, and firm due to the overabundance of milk. The fast and forceful flow of milk can cause discomfort, pain, or a tingling sensation during breastfeeding or pumping sessions. Engorgement and frequent milk supply can increase the likelihood of developing mastitis (breast infection) or plugged ducts,” she said.
The causes of hyperlactation syndrome are not fully understood, but several factors contribute to this condition. “Hormonal imbalances, particularly in prolactin and oxytocin, can result in an overproduction of breast milk. Additionally, the principle of supply and demand plays a role, as frequent and prolonged breastfeeding sessions stimulate the breasts to produce more milk than necessary. The baby’s latch and feeding habits also influence milk supply, as an efficient latch and vigorous feeding can signal the breasts to produce more milk,” Dr. Prasannalatha, Senior Obstetrician & Gynecologist, Kamineni Hospitals, Hyderabad told indianexpress.com.Advertisement
Treatment and prevention strategies for hyperlactation syndrome focus on managing milk oversupply and addressing associated breastfeeding challenges. These include:
*Block feeding: This involves nursing or expressing milk from one breast per feeding session, allowing the baby to receive hindmilk, which is richer in fat and can help satisfy their hunger. Block feeding helps regulate milk production and slows down the flow of milk.
*Breast compression: During breastfeeding, using gentle pressure on the breast with your hand can help slow down the milk flow and allow the baby to manage the flow more easily.
*Laid-back nursing positions: Positions like laid-back or reclined breastfeeding can allow the baby more control over the flow of milk. In these positions, gravity helps slow down the flow, and the baby can adjust their latch and positioning, according to their comfort.
*Utilise breastfeeding tools: Using breastfeeding tools, like nipple shields or paced bottle feeding, can help slow down the milk flow and allow the baby to have more control during feeds.
*Expressing milk: Expressing or pumping milk before breastfeeding can help reduce breast fullness and excessive milk flow. Removing a small amount of milk, just until the initial forceful letdown subsides, can make breastfeeding more manageable for the baby.

Effective strategies for parents to tackle uncontrolled obesity in childrenPremium Story,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents aged 5-19 has risen dramatically from just 4 per cent in 1975 to just over 18 per cent in 2016. The problem is even more grievous in India with a predicted 27 million children to be diagnosed with obesity by 2030, as per UNICEF’s World Obesity Atlas 2022.
On the face of it, the numbers may seem small because of the size of the Indian population but is a major worry for health experts.
“The worldwide guidelines for bariatric surgery for childhood obesity have been revised and early intervention for morbid obesity in children has been recommended in view of the early onset of diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea, and fatty liver disease seen at an early age,” Dr Shashank Shah, Consultant, Bariatric Surgery, P D Hinduja Hospital & Medical Research Centre, Khar told indianexpress.com.

There are three main categories of causes for childhood obesity, explained Dr Uday Phadke, Director-Dept. of Endocrinology & Diabetes, Sahyadri Hospitals. “Firstly, genetic obesity stems from a genetic fault in the child, often associated with genetic disorders or syndromic conditions that lead to weight gain and other abnormalities,” he said.
The paramount cause of childhood obesity can be attributed to environmental factors, notably diet and exercise. “Factors such as the consumption of calorie-dense foods, the preference for formula diets over breastfeeding, and the powerful influence of enticing advertisements promoting high-calorie foods contribute to excessive eating habits,” Dr Phadke noted.
Furthermore, he explained that sedentary behaviours, such as excessive screen time and reduced outdoor play, significantly contribute to the prevalence of childhood obesity. Similarly, the impact of family behaviour cannot be ignored as parents’ busy schedules and the adoption of a Western lifestyle, often characterised by dining out and relying on fast food, exacerbate this issue.
Although less common, Dr Phadke said that hormone-related diseases such as growth hormone deficiency or excessive cortisol production can contribute to obesity in some cases. Additionally, factors such as excessive maternal weight gain during pregnancy and maternal diabetes can contribute to obesity in children.Advertisement
“By understanding and addressing these various causes, we can effectively tackle childhood obesity and promote healthier outcomes for our young patients,” he said.
Signs to look out for

Recognising signs that can indicate childhood obesity is very important. Primary indicators of childhood obesity are family history and the child’s growth patterns.
Explaining this, Dr Phadke said, “It is essential to assess syndromic factors or single gene disorders as they may contribute to mental abnormalities. Moreover, paying attention to the timing of weight gain is crucial.”
For example, he said that if a child who was previously within a normal weight range suddenly becomes overweight, it could signify an underlying disease or problem. Children with underlying diseases often exhibit a short and fat body shape, whereas those who are overweight due to overeating and lack of exercise may have a tall and fat physique. Additionally, certain medical conditions or the use of drugs like steroids can contribute to obesity and should be taken into consideration during the evaluation process.Advertisement
By recognising these signs and factors, one can effectively identify and address childhood obesity, leading to better outcomes for our young patients.

Precautions
Dr Shah recommended the following strategies to combat childhood obesity:
*Awareness about a healthy diet, excess calories, and activity among children and parents is extremely necessary.Advertisement
*Education about healthy diet and lifestyle is necessary in schools.
*Junk food should be an option to enjoy occasionally and not become a staple diet.
*A close watch on a child’s weight as a part of overall health is very important. A weight gain of just 5 to 10 kg should alert the parents.
Concluding, he said, “Childhood obesity is growing exponentially. It is time that the government declares childhood obesity a new pandemic and starts taking action.”Advertisement

"Engage, Educate and Empower: The 3 Es to discuss climate change with childrenPremium Story","The Canadian wildfires over the last few months serve as a stark reminder of the far-reaching consequences of climate change.
Children, especially those with asthma, face heightened health risks due to wildfire smoke. In some regions, concerns about decreased air quality have led to school closures and cancelled extracurricular activities. Distressing videos of smoke-filled cityscapes have gone viral on social media.
As climate change intensifies, wildfires, along with floods, droughts and extreme temperatures, will be increasingly common.Advertisement
As researchers in climate law and psychology, we believe that it is critical for parents, caregivers and educators to consider discussing climate change with children and youth.
A harmful legacy for future generations
All United Nations member states, along with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and over 99 per cent of climate scientists, accept that human activities cause climate change.
As climate change intensifies, future generations will inherit a profoundly altered planet. They will inhabit a planet with poorer air quality, heightened risk of illnesses like Lyme disease, and a myriad of other detrimental medical conditions.
Given its drastic effects, climate change can prompt understandable feelings of anxiety about the future. A recent worldwide study found that 84 per cent of 16- to 25-year-olds expressed at least moderate worries about climate change. In Canada, more than 78 per cent of young people have reported that climate change has impacted their mental health.Advertisement
Children with such anxious feelings are more likely to feel depressed, sad and less motivated in their lives.
Children and youth care about climate change
Since younger generations are likely to experience the more drastic effects of climate change, they also need to be part of the solution. Thankfully, young people have already emerged as trailblazers.
This is important because children concerned with the effects of climate change can inspire pro-environmental behaviours in themselves and others.
Young activists, including Australia’s Anjali Sharma, Canada’s Sophia Mathur, Germany’s Luisa Neubauer, Sweden’s Greta Thunberg and the United States’ Xiuhtezcatl Martinez, have led legal challenges urging governments to accelerate climate response efforts.Advertisement
These legal challenges show the increasing concerns about the effects of climate change on Generation Z and future generations.
We need to discuss climate change with children and youth
Given that children and youth suffer the consequences of climate change and are called to play a key role in mitigating its effects, it is important to engage in discussions about climate change with them, even when it’s hard.
Parents and caregivers may have different reasons for not discussing climate change with their children. Some may find it difficult to explain technical climate science facts, particularly to young children. Others may intuitively want to shield their children from the worrying effects of climate change, thus avoiding the topic.Advertisement
Despite these concerns, it is important to have open and honest discussions with children about climate change.
Climate change is having major consequences on our world, sparking conversations in classrooms and on social media. It is important for parents to join these discussions to help instill values and create an open space for children to discuss their thoughts and feelings about climate change.
Sometimes, this may mean having honest conversations about the upcoming challenges. At other times, this may mean providing comfort and reassurance about the future.
The three Es
In thinking about how to discuss climate change with children and youth, remember the three Es: Engage, Educate and Empower. This can help parents and caregivers instill hope and resilience in the next generation.
1. EngageAdvertisement
You can engage your kids through conversation. UNICEF advises initiating discussions about children’s understanding of climate change and their feelings towards it. The recent wildfires provide an easy example of how climate change affects our daily lives.
These conversations open avenues for parents and caregivers to delve into their child’s hopes and fears regarding our changing environment. They also provide space to explore our values and moral obligations.
By actively participating in these conversations, adults can gain valuable insights and broaden their own knowledge alongside their children.
The Australian Psychological Society provides a guide on age-appropriate conversation topics.Advertisement
For example, with young children, you can discuss the impact of small actions like reducing waste and respecting the environment. With school-going children, you can start exploring the basics of climate change. With preteens and teens, you can talk about climate action and how we should respond to climate change.
2. Educate
Often, climate change can be a topic of much confusion and division. To avoid perpetuating these effects on future generations, it is important to rely on trustworthy sources.
The 2023 IPCC policymakers report offers an accessible summary of the latest climate science. NASA also offers child-friendly resources explaining the science of climate change. Climate Kids offers games and quizzes for middle school children. Many books have also been released on climate change catering to school-aged children, preteens and high school students.
Practical education, like walking in green spaces, can provide an invaluable educational opportunity to reflect on how climate change has and will continue to change our surroundings.Advertisement
To guide this reflection, the Prairie Climate Centre offers an atlas of climate effects across Canada to help understand the direct effects of climate change on our surroundings.
3. Empower
The first step to empowering your kids for the future is to help them take on actions to help the environment. This can start right at home through actions like taking shorter showers, reducing food waste or conserving electricity. It can also be done by involving them in family decisions that use a climate-friendly lens to discuss topics like family vacation plans and gifts.
Young people can also build communities through local and global environmental organizations. Some organizations engage in local actions such as the creation and maintenance of community gardens.
Parents and caregivers can encourage the next generation to pursue careers in the green economy sectors including renewable energy, forestry and urban planning.Advertisement

Families with transgender kids are increasingly forced to travel out of state for the care they need,"On an early morning in June, Flower Nichols and her mother set off on an expedition to Chicago from their home in Indianapolis.
The family was determined to make it feel like an adventure in the city, though that wasn’t the primary purpose of the trip.
The following afternoon, Flower and Jennilyn Nichols would see a doctor at the University of Chicago to learn whether they could keep Flower, 11, on puberty blockers.Advertisement
They began to search for medical providers outside of Indiana after April 5, when Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb signed a law banning transgender minors from accessing puberty blockers and other hormone therapies, even after the approval of parents and the advice of doctors.
At least 20 states have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming care for trans minors, though several are embroiled in legal challenges.
For more than a decade prior, such treatments were available to children and teens across the U.S. and have been endorsed by major medical associations.
Opponents of gender-affirming care say there’s no solid proof of purported benefits, cite widely discredited research and say children shouldn’t make life-altering decisions they might regret.Advertisement
Advocates and families impacted by the recent laws say such care is vital for trans kids.On June 16, a federal judge blocked parts of Indiana’s law from going into effect on July 1.
But many patients still scrambled to continue receiving treatment. Jennilyn Nichols wanted their trip to Chicago to be defined by happy memories rather than a response to a law she called intrusive.
They would explore the Museum of Science and Industry and, on the way home, stop at a beloved candy store.Preserving a sense of normalcy and acceptance, she decided — well, that’s just what families do.
Families in Indiana, Mississippi and other states are navigating new laws that imply or sometimes directly accuse them of child abuse for supporting their kids in getting health care. Some trans children and teens say the recent bans on gender-affirming care in Republican-led states send the message that they are unwelcome and cannot be themselves in their home states.Advertisement
For parents, guiding their children through the usual difficulties of growing up can be challenging enough. But now they are dealing with the added pressure of finding out-of-state medical care they say allows their children to thrive.
In the Nichols family alone, support took many forms as they traveled to Chicago: a grandmother who pitched in to babysit Flower’s 7-year-old brother, Parker, while their father Kris worked; a community of other parents of trans kids who donated money to make the trip more comfortable.

“What transgender expansive young people need is what all young people need: They need love and support, and they need unconditional respect,” said Robert Marx, an assistant professor of child and adolescent development at San José State University.
Marx studies support systems for LGBTQ+ and trans people aged 13 to 25. “They need to feel included and part of a family.”Advertisement
In Indiana, rancorous legislative debates, agitated family relationships and exhaustive efforts to find care have drawn families to the support group GEKCO, founded by Krisztina Inskeep, whose adult son is transgender.
Attendance at monthly meetings spiked after the state legislature advanced bills targeting trans youth, she said.“I think most parents want to do best by their kids,” Inskeep said.
“It’s rather new to people, this idea that gender is not just a binary and that your kid is not just who they thought at birth.”The perceptions of most parents, Marx said, don’t align neatly with the extremes of full support or rejection of their kids’ identities.“Most parents exist in a kind of gray area,” Marx said.
“Most parents are going through some kind of developmental process themselves as they come to understand their child’s gender.”Advertisement
On June 13, Flower and Jennilyn set off on their trip, unsteady but hopeful.
They brought a care plan from Indiana University’s Riley Children’s Hospital, the Hoosier State’s only gender clinic.At the time, the pair worried whether Chicago providers could meet their request for full-time support or as a backup if Indiana’s ban went on hold.
They considered whether they could make the drive every three months, the necessary interval between Flower’s puberty blockers.
The decision for Flower to start puberty blockers two years ago wasn’t one the family took lightly.Jennilyn recalled asking early on whether her daughter’s gender expression was permanent.Advertisement
She wondered if she had failed as a mom, especially while pregnant — was it an incorrect food? A missed vitamin?Ultimately she and Kris dismissed those theories, ungrounded in science, and listened to their daughter, who recalled the euphoria of wearing princess dresses at an early age.
Flower cherished a Little Red Riding Hood cape and felt certain of her identity from the start.“I remember that I really disliked my name,” Flower said of her birth name. “This is just like who I am. It’s all that I have a memory of.”Conversations between Flower and her mother are often marked by uncommon candor, as when discussing early memories together at an Indianapolis park.
“Before I knew you and before I walked this journey with you,” Jennilyn told her, “I would not have thought that a kid would know they were trans or that a kid would just come out wired that way.
I always thought that that was something adults figured out, and so there were times that it was really scary because I didn’t know how the world would accept you. I didn’t know how to keep you safe.”Now, Jennilyn said, her worries have shifted to Flower’s spelling skills and how she’ll navigate crushes.Advertisement
Flower, for her part, appreciates being heard. She said she and her parents make medical decisions together because, “of course, they can’t decide on a medicine for me to take.”“At the same time, you can’t pick a medicine that we can’t afford to pay for or that, you know, might harm you,” Jennilyn responded.“That’s what I really like about her,” Flower said, of her mother. “She leaves a lot of my life up to me.
In Mississippi, a ban on gender-affirming care became law in the state on Feb. 28 — prompting a father and his trans son to leave the state at the end of July for Virginia. There, he can keep his health care and continue to see doctors.
“We are essentially escaping up north,” said Ray Walker, 17.Walker lives with his mother, Katie Rives, in a suburb of Jackson, the state capital. His parents are divorced, but his father also lived in the area.
Halfway through high school, Walker is an honors student with an interest in theater and cooking. He has a supportive group of friends. When Mississippi Republican Gov.Advertisement
Tate Reeves signed the bill banning hormone therapy for anyone younger than 18, he accused “radical activists” of pushing a “sick and twisted ideology that seeks to convince our kids they’re in the wrong body.”

The state’s largest hospital halted hormone treatments for trans minors months before Reeves signed the ban. That hospital later closed its LGBTQ+ clinic.
After that clinic stopped offering its services, Walker and other teenagers received treatment at a smaller facility in another city, but those services ended once the ban took effect.
\As access to gender-affirming dwindled and was later outlawed, Walker’s father, who declined to be interviewed, accepted a job in Virginia, where his son could keep his health care. Walker plans to move in with his father this month. Rives, however, is staying in Mississippi with her two younger children.
Walker’s memories of the anguished period when he started puberty at 12 still haunt him.
“My body couldn’t handle what was happening to it,” he said. After a yearslong process of evaluations, then puberty blockers and hormone injections, Walker said his self-image improved. Then the broad effort in conservative states to restrict gender-affirming care set its sights on Mississippi.
The path toward stability that Walker and his family forged had narrowed. It soon became impassable.“I was born this way. It’s who I am. I can’t not exist this way,” Walker said. “We were under the impression that I still had two years left to live here. The law just ripped all of that up. They’re ripping our lives apart.” The family sees no alternative.
“Mississippi is my home, but there are a lot of conflicting feelings when your home is actively telling you that it doesn’t want you in it,” Walker said.
As Walker’s moving date approaches, Rives savors the moments the family shares together. She braces for the physical distance that will soon be between them.
Her two younger sons will lose Ray’s brotherly presence in their daily lives. She still feels lucky.“We know that’s an incredibly privileged position to be in,” Rives said of her son moving to Virginia.
“Most people in Mississippi cannot afford to just move to another state or even go to another state for care.”

Flower, initially dispirited by the debates at the Indiana Statehouse, brightened after her parents took her to her first Pride march on June 10 in Indianapolis. She tied a transgender pride flag around her shoulders and covered her pink shirt in every rainbow heart-shaped sticker she could find. She gripped a sign that read: “She belongs.”
Her favorite activities are often less inflected with politics than her status as a soon-to-be teenager. She’s a Girl Scout who enjoys catching Pokemon with her brother.
Before the trip, she zipped around an Indianapolis park on a pink scooter, her hair tangled by the wind.Prior to entering Chicago’s Museum of Science and Industry, Flower used a women’s bathroom.
At a diner in the city, she ordered a mint chocolate chip milkshake and a vegan grilled cheese. Jennilyn created an itinerary to make their experience as joyful and uncomplicated as possible.“First of all, we’re going be able to chill at the hotel in the morning,” Flower said. “Second of all, there’s a park nearby that we can have a lot of fun in.
Third of all, we might have a backup plan, which is really exciting. And fourth of all: Candy store!”The doctor’s appointment the following day, initially intimidating, soon gave them another reason to celebrate: If care was not available in Indiana, they could get it in Chicago.
“Indiana could do whatever the hell they’re going to do,” Jennilyn said, “and we can just come here.

Things parents should never say in front of kidsPremium Story,"The formative years of a child’s life shapes the way they act and think later on in life. But since children learn the most from their parents, the onus of building their child’s character also lies in the parents’ hands. Thus, it is crucial to be careful about what experiences they subject their child to. This also entails being cautious about what you say and do in front of your child.
Talking about the same, Himani, a parenting coach took to Instagram to share three things you should never discuss in front of your kids.
Have a look.

1) Never say negative about your family members in front of them
When you talk negatively about your own family members in front of your children, they don’t respect them.Advertisement
Concurring, Dr Rahul Chandhok, Head-Mental Health & Behavioral Science, Artemis Hospital, Gurgaon said, “It can contribute to the development of a negative and biased mindset. Children often look up to their parents as role models and when parents engage in negative talk, it normalises and perpetuates a culture of gossip and disrespect. Moreover, it can harm the child’s relationships with those being spoken about and can create tension and conflict within social circles. Encouraging kindness, empathy, and constructive communication helps children develop healthy and respectful relationships with others.”
2) Don’t argue or fight with your partner in front of them
Always solve your own personal issues in private.
Dr Chandhok said that witnessing parental conflict can cause significant emotional distress and anxiety in children. They may feel scared, helpless, or responsible for the arguments.
“It can undermine the stability and security of the family environment, affecting the child’s sense of safety and trust. Children often model their behaviour after their parents, so witnessing frequent conflicts may normalise aggressive or unhealthy communication patterns. By resolving conflicts privately, parents provide a more nurturing and harmonious environment, promoting emotional resilience, healthy relationship skills, and overall well-being for their children,” he said.Advertisement
However, Shravani Bongu, Psychologist & PhD Scholar said it is healthy for children to see parents having constructive discussions and arguments which are followed by reconciliation. This acts as a model in conflict resolution for children and they see arguments and making up as a healthy part of a relationship. “But if the argument is explosive and not constructive, it can be highly distressing for children. It creates feelings of fear, anxiety, and insecurity. Children may perceive the conflict as a threat to their family’s stability and well-being. They might also blame themselves leading to guilt and shame.”
3) Never say anything bad about school and their teacher
Don’t share your viewpoints about school and teachers as they can lose interest.
What other topics should parents avoid discussing in front of their children?

Parents should exercise discretion and avoid discussing certain sensitive topics in front of their children. “These topics include explicit details about their intimate relationships, financial problems, marital conflicts, discussions about divorce or separation, adult-oriented content such as violence or explicit language, and personal criticisms of family members or friends,” Dr Chandhok said.Advertisement
Additionally, he said that topics related to complex adult issues like politics, religion, and controversial social matters should be approached with caution, considering the child’s age and maturity level.
ALSO READ | Can parents give their children too much attention?
“Talking about such things might interfere with a child’s world view and perception of people around them. Parents might pass on their cognitive distortions and beliefs. It might encourage switchboard communication, which is not a healthy style of communication and force children to inadvertently handle adult emotions too early,” Dr Dhanya Chandran, Consultant, Clinical Psychology, Amrita Hospital, Kochi told indianexpress.com.
On the other hand, she said parents should talk to their children about their values and value-based actions, reflections on behaviours, normalising apologising and feeling vulnerable, death, grief and confusing emotions.

Sex education 101: Tips for talking to your kids about the subjectPremium Story,"Till date, sex is a taboo subject in our society. With minimum to no sex education given in schools and other institutions, it becomes vital for parents to take charge and have healthy conversations about sex and sexuality with their children. Afterall, research indicates that kids and teens who have regular discussions with their parents and caregivers about sex and relationships are less likely to take risks with their sexual health and more likely to be healthy and safe.
While its vital to have these conversations, it is also essential to keep it age appropriate. This might seem like a difficult task, but it’s all about the details you include. So, if you’re wondering how to teach your child about sex, we have got you covered.

*Build a foundation of trust
*Add layers upon layers of knowledge–not too fast not too slow
*Let them feel and see what you teach is true to trust you better
*Hear them intently with their curiosities
According to Shravani Bongu, Psychologist and PhD Scholar, children are extremely curious by nature, and if parents do not give them the answers, they will find other, perhaps more unreliable sources, to clear their questions. 
“Always have an open line of communication with your child and explicitly state that they can come to you regarding any queries they have. Never shame a child or get angry when they ask you something. If any question or topic is asked suddenly or takes you aback, you can always tell them that you will get back to them. Take the time you need to process the question and frame the answer in an age-appropriate way. Be direct and clear in your answers. If you are unsure, let them know that you will get back to them with more information,” she advised.Advertisement
Apart from the topics mentioned above, Bongu mentioned that it is also critical to address internet safety and media literacy in the digital age. Teach youngsters about appropriate internet use, the dangers of revealing personal information online, and how to critically analyse online sex and relationship content.
“Frame your answers based on the child’s age, level of comprehension, and nature of question they ask. Let them know that there are no wrong questions, and they can always come to you no matter what. If you want to initiate the conversation yourself, make sure the environment is comfortable and create a safe space between you and your child,” the psychologist concluded.

Are you a working parent? Here are some expert-approved tips to establish a work-life balancePremium Story,"If you often feel like a circus artiste, although a bad one, juggling balls constantly, hoping and praying none of them will drop and take your entire life with you, then you are not alone. Between laundry cycles, kitchen duties, house chores, childcare and countless other things, it might feel like you’re getting buried under a mountain of tasks, especially if you’re also someone who has a demanding work life.
Psychologist Dr Nisha Khanna said parents are the role models for their children. “Your kids learn and observe self-care, discipline, effective communication, conflict-resolution, basically everything from you.”
When you’re the blueprint on which your child’s building is going to be built, it is important you set the right example for them. The first step in doing that is striking a work-life balance. Yes, we know it sounds elusive, but we’re here to help.Advertisement
Khanna said establishing a work-life balance will not only help in the holistic growth of your children but also yourself. “You’ll be able to handle things better; the quality of your relationships will be better too.”
Here are some ways she suggests you can create a balance your work and home life as a working parent.
 Khanna puts this first on the list as when you identify your priorities. (Source: Getty Images)
Identify your priorities
Khanna puts this first on the list as when you identify your priorities, it is easier to do the other things on this list. “Recognise what is important for you, what isn’t. This will help you declutter your life easily,” she said.
Set boundaries Advertisement
Learn how to say no, Khanna advises, as that will make your life much easier. “Work is a part of life, not your life. Give it designated time. This will also ensure better productivity,” she said.

While you’re taking of the family, don’t forget to take care of yourself, Khanna strongly highlighted. Parenting can be exhausting so you’re allowed to let off some steam every now and then. Indulge in things you like doing. Take out time just to relax.
Ask for support when you need it
Khanna advised delegating work to others, especially when you need all the help you can get. “Understand your weaknesses and strengths so that you can work around them and ask others to fill, both at home and work,” she said.Advertisement

"Diabetes in children: Symptoms, treatment and precautionsPremium Story","Diabetes is a common health condition around the world. After COVID-19, there has been an unusual spike in the number of children and teenagers around the world being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Recent research published in the journal JAMA Network showed that India topped the list of counties with the most cases and fatalities from childhood diabetes in 2019. The highest disability-adjusted life years (DALY) are also found in the country.
According to a report in the BBC, rise in diabetes cases in India, can be attributed to “changing lifestyles, improved standards of living, migrations to cities, erratic working hours, sedentary habits, stress, pollution, change in food habits and easy availability of fast food are some of the reasons why diabetes is rising in India”.
Symptoms of diabetes in children
Type 1 diabetes in children can present various symptoms. Dr Navneet Agrawal, Chief Clinical Officer, BeatO said, “Children with type 1 diabetes often experience severe hyperglycemia, resulting from insufficient insulin production. This can lead to a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Severe abdominal pain or repeated vomiting may also indicate the presence of diabetic ketoacidosis.”Advertisement
Additionally, symptoms can include excessive urination (polyuria), increased hunger (polyphagia), excessive thirst (polydipsia) and significant weight loss, the expert said.
He recommends parents to seek medical attention when they observe their child not gaining weight, experiencing rapid weight loss or noticing ants attracted to the child’s urine. “It is crucial for parents to be aware of these symptoms and consult a doctor promptly if they observe any early signs of type 1 diabetes in their child,” Dr Agrawal said.
How to manage blood sugar levels in children

The primary and recommended treatment for managing type 1 diabetes in children is insulin therapy. Dr Agrawal advises to consult a healthcare professional, such as a diabetologist or an endocrinologist, to initiate insulin therapy.
“The specific type and dosage of insulin will be determined based on the child’s individual blood glucose levels. Once insulin therapy is initiated, regular monitoring of blood glucose levels becomes essential. Monitoring blood glucose levels and making appropriate insulin dosage changes are important aspects of managing type 1 diabetes in children,” he added.Advertisement
While at present, there is no known preventive therapy for type 1 diabetes as it is an autoimmune condition, Dr Agrawal said that it is worth noting that the growing prevalence of obesity among teenagers and adolescents has been connected to the later development of type 2 diabetes in adulthood.

“Parents have a vital role in motivating children to engage in regular physical activity, advocating for a balanced and nutritious diet, and cultivating healthy habits. These proactive measures can substantially decrease the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes in the future. If an adolescent is overweight or obese, working towards weight loss under the guidance of healthcare professionals can be beneficial in reducing the vulnerabilities to type 2 diabetes,” he concluded.

Breastfeeding is beneficial for both the mother and baby; here’s whyPremium Story,"Motherhood is one of the most glorious periods of a woman’s life. However, it can be equally daunting and terrifying as it comes with its own challenges. Among them is the struggle of breastfeeding their newborn baby which can cause sleepless nights and extreme worry if the lactation supply is not enough.
But did you know that many health organisations including the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of a baby’s life. After this duration, breastfeeding should continue alongside the introduction of complementary foods until at least two years of age.
Calling breastfeeding the natural way of nourishing babies, Dr Ritu Sethi, Director, The Aura Speciality Clinic Gurgaon and Senior Consultant- Gynaecology, Cloud Nine Hospitals, Gurgaon told indianexpress.com, “Breast milk contains a perfect balance of nutrients that are essential for the baby’s growth and development, and it also contains antibodies that help protect the baby against various infections and diseases.”Advertisement
Adding, Sushma Jethmalania, Humm Care Childbirth and Lactation educator said, “Babies can be fed directly from the mother’s breast, or breast milk can be pumped and then fed to the baby from a bottle. Breast milk contains calories, vitamins, minerals, and other important nutrients that help an infant grow and develop. It helps your baby fight off sickness and disease.”
Similarly, Dr Amina Khalid, Obstetrician-Gynaecologist took to Instagram to share the various benefits of breastfeeding. Have a look.

Safest food for baby
Besides having the convenience of no prep being required for feeding– the washing and sterilising the bottles, breastfeeding makes sure that the milk reaches your baby directly without any contamination or without the milk getting spoilt.
Concurring, Dr Sethi said, “Breast milk is produced by the mother’s body and is naturally sterile. It does not require any preparation or handling, reducing the risk of contamination from external sources.”
Good for baby’s tummyAdvertisement
The breastmilk has proteins that are more nutritious and easily digestible than the formula milks. Which is why the breastfed babies rarely have diarrhoea or constipation. Healthy tummy, healthy babies.
In a similar vein, Dr Sethi explained that breast milk contains specific antibodies and other substances that can inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria in the babies’ digestive system. This protection helps reduce the risk of gastrointestinal infections, such as diarrhea and necrotizing enterocolitis.
Increase in child’s IQ
A few studies suggest that breastfed babies appear to have a higher IQ. But even if this may not be certain, you can be sure that it definitely develops them intellectually because of the mother-baby close contact and interaction while being breastfed.
Prevents allergies and infections
Breastmilk is full of nutritious vitamins, minerals, antibodies and immunoglobulins which protects the baby against allergic conditions like asthma/skin allergies as well as against various infections.Advertisement
Agreeing to this, Jethmalania said, “Breastfed babies have a lower risk of asthma, obesity, type 1 diabetes, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). They are also less likely to have ear infections and stomach bugs. Breast milk shares antibodies from the mother with her baby. These antibodies help babies develop a strong immune system and protect them from illnesses.”
Develops the tastebuds
Want babies who fuss less over food later in life? Breastmilk kind of passes over a slight flavour of whatever you eat, so you are at liberty of helping your babies develop their taste and likings to whatever food you may like!

How breastfeeding is beneficial for mommies?
Apart from numerous benefits to the baby, breastfeeding is equally important for a new mother’s health. Dr Sethi said that breastfeeding stimulates the release of oxytocin or happy hormone, which helps the uterus contract and return to its pre-pregnancy size. “This can aid in postpartum recovery and reduce postpartum bleeding,” she continued.Advertisement
Additionally, she mentioned that long-term breastfeeding has been associated with a reduced risk of breast and ovarian cancers in mothers.

It also promotes bonding between the mother and baby. “Skin-to-skin contact and the act of nursing create a strong emotional connection, fostering a sense of security and comfort for both,” Dr Sethi concluded.

Monsoon health: Follow these expert-approved tips to protect your child from skin conditions this seasonPremium Story,"As much as children may love getting wet in the rain, their parents hate it. Other than the obvious risk of developing a fever or cold, dirt-streaked clothes and faces, your kids may also develop some skin conditions that are common during the monsoon.
Dr Aanchal Panth, Consultant Dermatologist and Hair Transplant Surgeon, Dermafollix Hair Transplant and Skin Clinic said, “Children are prone to develop skin infections in monsoon due to a damaged skin barrier.”
Explaining that during the monsoon, children are likely to get wet, Dr Kritu Bhandari M.D. in Dermatology & Cosmetology, Co-founder of Orijine Clinic said, “It can make them susceptible to fungal infections. Also, given the higher humidity levels, atopic dermatitis flare-ups are common, and can lead to other bacterial infections as well.”Advertisement
They might also contract heat rashes and insect bite hypersensitivity, Panth added.
The focus should be on building robust immunity of the child by following a balanced diet, keeping them hydrated and maintaining overall hygiene. But there are some skincare tips you must follow when it comes to protecting them from monsoon-borne skin issues.
 Avoid synthetics – breathable cottons are the best option. (Source: Unsplash)
Avoid letting them sit in wet clothes
Panth recommended bathing them immediately and never letting them sit in wet clothes.Advertisement
On the other hand, Bhandari suggested keeping clothes dry in this humid climate, and ironing them lightly to keep the fabric dry and comfortable. “Avoid synthetics – breathable cottons are the best option, and it is suggested to rinse clothes with an antiseptic solution to prevent fungal build-up in clothes,” she added.
Keep their skin dry but moisturised 
Ensure the skin remains dry, especially in areas prone to sweating using well-dried soft microfibre towels. Bhandari advised against sharing personal items like towels, that can spread an infection. “Applying anti-fungal powders can also help keep the skin dry,” she said.
Panth said applying a thin layer of moisturiser on their whole body after bathing is crucial as it will help restore the lipid barrier on their skin. “Use calamine lotion on areas of rash. Wipe and put powder in body folds so there is no moisture left after bathing.”

Bathe them with lukewarm waterAdvertisement
Avoid hot-water baths as that may strip the skin from its inherent moisture.
“Clean the skin using gentle soaps and lukewarm water. Do look out for the soap ingredients, and make sure they are suitable for your child’s delicate skin, and are mild and paraben-free,” Bhandari said.
Moisture and sweat tend to clog pores, so Bhandari recommended washing your child’s head with a pH balance gentle shampoo two to three times a week.
Make use of mosquito repellants
Use mosquito repellents to keep your child safe from common mosquito borne diseases, Bhandari said.Advertisement
Meanwhile, Panth recommended applying a soothing lotion to avoid excessive scratching of mosquito bites. “Use mosquito repellent patches or bands when they play outdoors,” she said.
Despite all your care, if your child develops any skin issues during the monsoon season, seek timely medical advice and appropriate treatment from your dermatologist.

"Parents, follow these techniques to prevent cell phone addiction in your kidsPremium Story","The easiest babysitting hack known to modern adults is to give their child a smartphone, keeping them completely engrossed with no need for supervision. From doom-scrolling and group texts with friends to YouTube videos, kids can’t seem to put down their phones. This unhealthy addiction to phones can have a negative effect on overall well-being.
Depression, anxiety, isolation, aggression, poor grades, loss of interest in activities, weight gain and lack of sleep are just some warning signs associated with cell phone addiction.
Now, you must be wondering what exactly makes kids addicted to their phones. Talking about the issue, Pankaj Kumar Singh, the Managing Director of Cambridge Montessori Preschool and Daycare, said that phones provide easy access to various entertainment and engaging content such as games, videos and social media.Advertisement
“The instant gratification and constant stimulation provided by these platforms can be highly captivating for young minds. Moreover, children often imitate their parents’ phone usage habits, leading to increased dependency. Additionally, some games and apps are designed to be addictive, employing psychological tactics like rewards and notifications to keep children engaged for extended periods,” he added.
Cell phone addiction, however, is highly preventable. Parents play a pivotal role in preventing phone addiction in children. According to Singh, here are some techniques parents can use to decrease phone addiction in children:
 Engage children in outdoor play, reading books together, participating in arts and crafts, or organising family activities. (Source: Freepik)
*Establish clear rules and boundaries regarding phone usage. Communicate and enforce these rules consistently to create a sense of structure.
*Set limits on screen time and specific usage hours, ensuring that children have a balanced approach to technology.Advertisement
*Encourage alternative activities that promote physical, intellectual, and social development.
*Engage children in outdoor play, reading books together, participating in arts and crafts, or organising family activities. Creating a diverse range of experiences helps reduce reliance on phones for entertainment.
While excessive phone usage is harmful, these devices can be used constructively as well. Parents can leverage the benefits of phones in several ways.
“Parents can use educational apps and games that promote learning, problem-solving, and creativity. These apps can teach various subjects, enhance critical thinking skills, and introduce new concepts. Additionally, parents can utilise phones as tools for interactive learning,” said Singh.Advertisement
Adding, he said, “Children can explore educational videos, audiobooks, virtual tours, or engage in language learning apps. It is crucial to select age-appropriate and high-quality content to ensure the constructive use of phones.”

Can parents give their children too much attention?Premium Story,"Parents today spend more time with their children than ever before. Yet, at the same time, they worry more than previous generations about doing enough – believing a lack of engagement may harm their child’s future success and wellbeing.
This can have negative impacts. Increased social pressures on mothers to be engaged with their children, compared to fathers, is negatively affecting maternal wellbeing. The COVID-19 pandemic and home schooling intensified this.
This raises an important question: how much attention is enough? Is it harmful to leave your child to their own devices? Should you ever ignore a child? Or conversely, can you overly engage with your child? As is usually the case with child development, the answer is somewhere in the middle (and most parents, reassuringly, are doing “enough”).Advertisement
We know that a supportive parenting approach is important for child development. Attachment theory states that when a baby has its needs met by a parent or primary caregiver in an appropriate and consistent way, they are more likely to go on to develop a secure attachment to that person.
This helps them to feel more confident in themselves and the world, leading to more positive cognitive, social and emotional development.
However, while secure attachment is important, ever rising levels of attention won’t necessarily increase it proportionally.
Instead, it is important to carefully consider the degree of engagement and balance this with supporting children to reach appropriate stages of resilience and independence.Advertisement
One piece of evidence which gets dragged up a lot when attachment is discussed is research on the outcomes of children placed in Romanian orphanages.
These children were typically significantly deprived of interaction, affection and care and did not have opportunity to develop a secure attachment.
Studies of their later development found that they had poorer physical, cognitive and social developmental outcomes.
These studies are important, but a world away from the spectrum of parental engagement that most parents worry about today.Advertisement
Research examining more typical parent-child relationships finds that, yes, when mothers and fathers are more connected to and involved with their children, social and emotional outcomes improve.
Talking and reading to children in their early years is particularly important for language and literacy skills.
Listening to, and supporting, children to understand and learn to regulate their own emotions is also important for later emotional and social wellbeing.
Curiosity, confidence and narcissism
On the other hand, children also need room to take the lead in their own growth and development.Advertisement
Overly intensive or “helicopter” parenting, where parents are reluctant to leave their child to experience activities alone (obviously sometimes this is impossible, for example if the child has additional learning needs), can actually increase risk of anxiety and poorer coping skills in the children when they become teenagers and young adults.
That’s because children learn through having the opportunity to make mistakes, taking small, age-appropriate risks during play and having the chance to decide which activity they will engage in.
This builds feelings of competence, agency and autonomy. Boredom, in moderation, also encourages active and creative play which has many positive outcomes for physical, cognitive and social development, and has also been linked to increased curiosity.
Conversely, when a child’s day is controlled for them and their path always smoothed, they can struggle to develop the coping skills and resilience needed for everyday life.Advertisement
And while it may seem attention will ultimately boost confidence, there is some evidence showing that when parents are overly focused on their children – living their lives through them, constantly validating them and putting intense pressure on them to perform – this can increase narcissistic traits in children when they reach young adulthood.
Changing and adapting
How much engagement a child needs also naturally changes over time. Babies and children develop physically and emotionally as they grow, and parenting that adapts to these changes is typically associated with better outcomes.
It doesn’t make sense to leave a young baby who has no ability to support themselves alone for long periods to “encourage their independence”.
That will instead likely increase stress hormone levels in their young, developing brains. But telling your pre-teen that they need to entertain themselves for the afternoon (at home) is supporting their growth.Advertisement
This brings us the concept of a happy medium and one of my favourite 20th century paediatricians – Donald Winnicott and his concept of “good enough mothering”. Winnicott spent many years watching mothers and babies and concluded that sometimes not being able to meet a baby’s needs immediately and perfectly was a good thing.
Although he believed that responding to a baby’s needs was important, he also believed that sometimes, having to wait a little because you are finishing something else, helped a baby learn that although they are loved and cared for, the world is not a perfect place.
This theory has been explored over the years and written about extensively in terms of broader “good enough parenting”, which is essentially supporting a happy medium.
Finally, one fascinating study looked at how much parents felt pressure to spend more time engaging with their children, and how much time they actually spent reading, doing sports, or watching television with them.Advertisement
Surprisingly, there was no significant relationship between the parents who felt the most and least pressure, suggesting that no matter how much time you spend engaging with your child, those feelings never really go away.
Perhaps that is the most important lesson. The vast majority of parents do enough (and if you’re worrying about it, it’s likely you do).

Instead, those feelings are driven by social judgement of all things parenting related. Let’s challenge that, instead of spending all that energy on worrying whether our children get enough attention.

Navigating Monsoon Season: Common Diseases and Precautions for ChildrenPremium Story,"During the monsoon season in India, there is an increased risk of gastrointestinal infections in children due to factors such as contaminated water, improper sanitation, and the spread of waterborne diseases. Some common gastrointestinal infections in children during this time include:

 Acute Diarrhea: This is one of the most common gastrointestinal infections during the monsoon season. It can be caused by various bacteria (such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella), viruses (such as rotavirus, norovirus), and parasites. Contaminated water and food are the primary sources of infection.
 Cholera: Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It is transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated water or food. During the monsoon, there is an increased risk of cholera outbreaks due to flooding and poor sanitation.
 Typhoid Fever: Typhoid fever is caused by the bacterium Salmonella typhi. It spreads through contaminated food and water.
 Hepatitis A: Hepatitis A is a viral infection that affects the liver and can cause jaundice and Acute Liver Failure. It spreads through the consumption of contaminated food or water.
 E. coli Infections: Escherichia coli (E. coli) infections can cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Certain strains of E. coli, such as enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), can cause severe symptoms. Contaminated water and food are common sources of E. coli infections during the monsoon season.

Prevention and proper hygiene practices are essential to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal infections during the monsoon season. If a child experiences symptoms of gastrointestinal infection, it is important to seek medical attention promptly.
These infections can be prevented if you follow certain preventive measures. Here are some steps you can take:

 Safe Drinking Water: Ensure that your child drinks clean, safe water. Boil water before consumption or use a reliable water purifier to eliminate harmful bacteria and viruses. Avoid giving your child tap water or water from unknown sources.
 Proper Hygiene Practices: Teach and encourage your child to practice good hand hygiene. Make sure they wash their hands thoroughly with soap and clean water before meals, after using the toilet, and after outdoor activities. If soap and water are not available, use alcohol-based hand sanitizers.
 Food Safety: Pay attention to food hygiene. Avoid giving your child raw or undercooked food items, especially seafood, meat, and eggs. Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly with clean water before consumption. It is also advisable to consume freshly prepared meals and avoid leftover or street food.
 Sanitation: Maintain good sanitation practices in and around your home. Keep the kitchen and dining areas clean and free from pests. Dispose of garbage properly and ensure that it is covered to prevent contamination. Use clean and sanitized utensils and food storage containers.
 Avoid Stagnant Water: Remove any stagnant water sources near your home, as they can become breeding grounds for mosquitoes and other disease-causing organisms. Mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and malaria are prevalent during the monsoon season.
 Vaccinations: Ensure that your child is up to date with all necessary vaccinations, including those for diseases such as rotavirus and hepatitis A. Consult with your pediatrician to determine the appropriate immunizations for your child.
 Personal Protection: During heavy rainfall or flooding, ensure that your child wears appropriate footwear and protective clothing to prevent contact with contaminated water and soil.
 Adequate Nutrition: Maintain a healthy and balanced diet for your child to boost their immune system. A well-nourished body is better equipped to fight off infections.
 Seek Medical Attention: If your child develops symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or fever, seek medical attention promptly. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent complications and spread of the infection.

By following these preventive measures, you can reduce the risk of gastrointestinal infections in children during the monsoon season and promote their overall health and well-being.

Study reveals poverty negatively affects structural wiring in children’s brains,"Growing up in poverty may impact the wiring of a child’s brain, according to a new study from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.
The study, published in JAMA Network Open, indicates a link between both neighborhood and household poverty and the brain’s white matter tracts, which allow for communication between brain regions. White matter plays a critical role in helping the brain process information.
The findings stem from the largest long-term study of brain development and child health conducted in the U.S. — the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, which was launched by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 2015. Washington University is a national leader in studies of the developing brain and is one of 21 study sites around the country participating in the ABCD Study, which is following nearly 12,000 children, beginning at ages 9 to 10, for at least a decade.Advertisement
“White matter integrity is very important in brain development,” said first author Zhaolong (Adrian) Li, a neuroimaging research technician in the Department of Psychiatry. “For example, weaknesses in white matter are linked to visuospatial and mental health challenges in children. If we can capture how socioeconomic status affects white matter early on in a child’s life, the hope is we can, one day, translate these findings to preventive measures.” The researchers also found that childhood obesity and lower cognitive function may explain, at least partially, poverty’s influence on white matter differences. Generally, children who grow up in poverty have a higher risk of obesity and score lower on tests of cognitive function than their peers in higher income neighborhoods and households. The latter could be due, in part, to limited access to enriching sensory, social and cognitive stimulation.
“Our finding that obesity and cognitive enrichment may be relevant mediators, if confirmed, would provide strong support for managing healthy weight and encouraging cognitively stimulating activities to support brain health in disadvantaged children,” said Tamara Hershey, PhD, the James S. McDonnell Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience and a professor of psychiatry and of radiology.
The research was conducted in the Neuroimaging Labs Research Center in the university’s Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology.
White matter, the densely packed nerve fibers deep in the brain, gets its white color from the fatty substance that surrounds nerve fibers. The fatty coating is responsible for the rapid transmission of information along nerve cell tracts. The organization and connectivity between these tracts support learning and proper communication across brain regions. Disruption in these communication pathways has been linked to physical challenges as well as worse mental health outcomes.Advertisement
The scientists used the publicly available ABCD Study database, through which they were able to model water movement as an indicator of white matter integrity in the brain scans of 8,842 children ages 9 to 11. Just like rocks, pebbles and boulders impact the flow of water in a river, diverse brain cell structures create barriers that hinder water diffusion. The researchers found less directional movement of water molecules in the brains of children living in poverty, signifying structural changes in white matter regions. They also found higher water content in spherical spaces in the brain, which hinted at possible neuroinflammation in children who live in poverty.
A child’s environment is complex, involving both neighborhood and family influences. Disadvantaged neighborhoods suffer disproportionately from unemployment, poverty, and income disparity. Single-parent homes are more common, and residents are typically less educated, earn a lower income, and own less property.
“Our analysis revealed that neighborhood poverty is linked to white matter differences and putative immune cell presence. We found a similar link when looking at household socioeconomic status, taking into account annual income and parental education,” Li said.
“Wealth and income inequality are accelerating in the U.S.,” said co-corresponding author Scott Marek, PhD, an assistant professor of radiology and of psychiatry. “We and others are starting to scratch the surface of how inequality may harm the developing brain and affect mental health outcomes. Our findings emphasize shifting away from the thinking that socioeconomics is a unitary construct. It’s not schools or parenting alone that matter for brain health. It’s likely the collection of many neighborhood and familial life factors.” Hershey, who directs the Neuroimaging Labs Research Center and is a co-corresponding author, cautioned that the study only looked at one time point. Therefore, it is too soon to know if poverty triggered the brain differences seen in the study, she said. However, the ABCD Study continues to track enrolled children through brain scans and cognitive testing with the potential for future long-term brain development studies in disadvantaged children.Advertisement

“We hope this work encourages future studies to examine modifiable health risk factors in large and longitudinal samples that would one day translate to intervention,” Hershey said.

A new study of Warlpiri language shows how ‘baby talk’ helps little kids learn to speakPremium Story,"Parents and other caregivers typically modify their speech when they talk to babies and young children.
They use simple sentences and special words, like “nana” for banana. They also speak slowly, use a higher pitch, and exaggerate the ups and downs of the “tune” of their speech.
In many languages, caregivers also exaggerate their vowels in a process called “hyperarticulation”.Advertisement
Researchers refer to all these things as “child or infant-directed speech”. But it is also commonly known as “motherese” or “baby talk”.
Baby talk is used around the world. A 2022 study involving people from 187 countries showed adults can tell whether speech is intended for children or adults, even when they have no familiarity with the language being used.
Our new research looks at how baby talk works in the Australian Indigenous language Warlpiri.
Why do we use baby talk?
Simplifying speech and using baby talk modifications makes it easier for children to understand. But it also helps children regulate their emotions because it sounds more positive.Advertisement
On top of this, the enhanced “tune” is thought to attract and maintain children’s attention to speech and the exaggerated vowels help babies learn the sounds of languages.
However, almost all we know about the shape and purpose of baby talk is based on studies of a few European languages, Mandarin and Japanese.
These are languages spoken in predominantly western, educated, industrialised, rich, democratic cultures. This excludes thousands of other languages spoken in the world.
For example, where most of the world’s languages have just five to seven vowel sounds, many European languages, including English, have more than double that number, making those languages rather unusual. This raises the question of what modifications speakers use in other types of languages and cultures.Advertisement
Do they use the same speech modifications to children? And if so, why?
Our research
Our research, published this month, investigates the use and purpose of child-directed speech in Warlpiri. Warlpiri is spoken in Central Australia by more than 3,000 people and has three vowel sounds: “i”, “a”, and “u”, which correspond loosely to the vowels in “bee”, “bah”, and “boo” in English.
To compare vowels in words spoken to children to words spoken to adults, we videoed four Warlpiri-speaking caregivers in conversation with other familiar adults and four young children (aged between two and three) at their homes.
Our approach deliberately considers the real-life social contexts in which conversations are had. Most previous work has recorded interactions with children in lab settings, and then recorded caregiver-adult interactions separately, typically with an unfamiliar researcher.Advertisement
Warlpiri baby talk helps children learn new words Our study showed Warlpiri speakers, with just three vowels, also use pitch and vowel modifications in their speech to young children.
It is the first time a finding like this has been established.
This is similar to what English speakers do. But there are also important differences.
Firstly, Warlpiri speakers raise their pitch and change the quality of their vowels so that they sound more like vowels produced by children. This modification likely enhances the children’s attention to speech. As other research has shown children prefer to listen to the voices of other children over adults.Advertisement
Secondly, Warlpiri speakers use vowel modifications for a special teaching purpose.
Walpiri caregivers pronounce nouns with very clear and exaggerated vowels. This is different from how they pronounce vowels in other parts of speech, such as verbs.
It is also very different from the way adult Walpiri speakers speak to each other. This helps little children learn new words by ensuring the names for things (often “toys” or “food”) stand out in speech.
Adults are probably not aware of how their vowels sound, or how they are changing them. But they are aware of other aspects of how they change their speech in baby talk style. As Alice Nelson Napurrurla also told us: “When we are sitting and talking with the little ones, we must always use their words […] like when we say ‘mangarri’ [food], ‘miyi’ [vegetable food], they say ‘nyanya’ [food]. Or when we say ‘jinta-kari’, ‘jinta-kari’ means ‘another one’, but the little ones they use ‘jija-jayi’ [another one] […] we’ve got to use their language.” Our study is the first to observe that caregivers use vowel and pitch modifications to achieve two different goals at the same time: to hold child attention and to teach the names for things.Advertisement
We believe they are able to do this because Warlpiri has only three vowels. By contrast, a new study of Danish, which has more than 20 vowels, revealed Danish caregivers make their speech slower and exaggerate the “tune” but do not hyperarticulate their vowels.
This shows us while baby talk might be a universal phenomenon, the vowel inventory of each language plays an important role in determining what strategies caregivers can use.
What next?
Our research shows again how baby talk is not an affectation or a silly thing adults do. It helps little children learn language.

Can children make you happy?
Children can have a positive impact on a parent’s mental health, but the relationship between parenthood and mental well-being is complex and multifaceted. “While raising children can bring joy and fulfillment, it also comes with various stressors and challenges that can potentially affect mental health,” Dr Mazher Ali – Consultant, Psychiatry, CARE Hospitals, Banjara Hills, Hyderabad told indianexpress.com.
On one hand, the presence of children can promote happiness and mental well-being. “Caring for and nurturing a child can provide a sense of purpose, meaning, and fulfillment. Parent-child interactions, such as playing, laughing, and bonding, can boost positive emotions and contribute to overall mental well-being. Additionally, the unconditional love and affection shared between parents and children can provide emotional support and a sense of connectedness, which can positively impact mental health,” he explained.

However, it is important to acknowledge that parenting can also be demanding and stressful. “Sleep deprivation, financial pressures, and the constant responsibilities of child-rearing can create challenges that may impact a parent’s mental health. It is crucial for parents to prioritise self-care, seek support from their social network or professionals when needed, and maintain a healthy work-life balance to ensure their own well-being,” added Dr Ali.

Plant-based meal packages associated with lower BMI in children: Study,"Taking a “food is medicine” approach, according to a new study undertaken by experts at the Mass General Brigham hospital system, could increase nutrition security for families while simultaneously lowering children’s body mass index (BMI). Researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital and Boston Children’s Hospital explored if providing weekly plant-based snacks to families seeking food assistance during the epidemic affected children’s weight.
The team found an association between increasing receipt of food packages and decreased BMI. The findings, published in the journal Preventing Chronic Disease, add to a growing body of evidence that providing plant-based foods could be a useful strategy to prevent childhood obesity in children from food-insecure families.
“It’s important to encourage healthy eating habits during childhood to help prevent co-morbidities associated with obesity later in life, but many families to do not have access to expensive healthy foods, such as produce,” said senior author Lauren Fiechtner, MD, MPH, Director of the Pediatric Nutrition Center at Mass General for Children and Health and Research Advisor at The Greater Boston Food Bank. “Food pantries like MGH Revere that can provide families with healthy foods are a huge help in making sure that kids have a long, healthy future and have the best cardiovascular and metabolic health possible from a young age.” Food insecurity increased by 55% percent in the United States in 2020, affecting 42% of households with children. This increase was driven by a variety of factors, such as the economic impacts of the pandemic, the closure of schools, and disruption of food supply chains. As food insecurity increased, so did the prevalence of childhood obesity, rising from 19.3% to 22.4% between August 2019 and August 2020.Advertisement
For families dealing with food insecurity, the challenge is usually one of food quality as much as food quantity.
“Children in families with food insecurity are frequently skipping meals or skipping food for a whole day because their family does not have enough money for food,” said Fiechtner. “One way for parents to stretch a tight food budget and make sure their children are at least eating something is to buy the cheapest foods available, which are often not nutritious and contribute to obesity and other health problems.” To help mitigate the impacts of pandemic-related food insecurity on childhood obesity, the MGH Revere Food Pantry provided weekly plant-based food packages to families seeking food assistance. The packages contained fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts, and whole grains, and were adjusted to family size to provide enough for three meals per day for each member of the household. Between January 1, 2021, and February 1, 2022, 107 children from 93 families, received weekly food packages, averaging about 27 packages per family for the whole study period.
The food packages were provided by the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Revere Food Pantry, a partnership between MGH and The Greater Boston Food Bank. The MGH Revere Food Pantry has provided healthy food and nutritional education to families in the greater Boston area since it opened its doors in 2020.
“For dozens of families, the MGH Revere Food Pantry was a literal lifeline during the pandemic by providing free weekly packages of healthy food for the entire household,” said study co-author Jacob Mirsky, MD, MA, DipABLM, Medical Director of the MGH Revere Food Pantry.Advertisement
The researchers examined BMI during a baseline period prior to receiving food packages and then during a follow-up period using the Mass General Brigham electronic health record. At the start of the study, 57% of children in the study aged 2-18 years had a BMI at or above the 85th percentile. At follow-up, this number was reduced to 49%. The researchers also saw a decrease in BMI with each additional food family package received and estimated that children in households who received 27 weeks or more of packages may have had a BMI decrease of 1.08 kg/m2 or more.
While the study focused specifically on the pandemic, the research suggests that these findings could carry over into strategies to address broader issues of food insecurity in the future.

“There was an immediate value to providing these food packages to support families during the pandemic, but we also enabled families and children to make healthier food choices, which we know is important to introduce when children are young,” said first author Allison Wu, MD MPH, Attending Physician in Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Nutrition at Boston Children’s Hospital. Wu is a research collaborator and former research fellow in the Harvard-Wide Pediatric Health Services Research Program. “This kind of support is not only important for their BMI in childhood, but also in informing how they choose foods and influencing what foods their families are preparing for them to promote overall health.”
This research, as well as the MGH Revere food pantry, are part of a larger Mass General Brigham ‘food as medicine’ strategy. In collaboration with the 2022 White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, Mass General Brigham committed $8.4 million to promote nutrition equity and security, support food as medicine programs to tackle diet-related diseases, and fund food-related programming at local community-based organizations across Massachusetts.Advertisement

Jonas Brothers and sweet advice for their daughters,"While just one of the Jonas Brothers has children of school age, the three siblings have already planned what they would tell their little girls on the first day of school. Speaking to People about teaming up with The Children’s Place for their 2023 Back-to-School campaign, Nick, Joe and Kevin Jonas share the sweet messages they plan to tell their daughters when it’s time to return to the classroom.
Kevin, 35, who shares daughters Valentina, 6, and Alena, 9, with wife Danielle Jonas, says he reminds his girls to “take it slow and day by day.” “Try to do your best. That’s all we can ask. We don’t ask for perfection, we just ask for them to try,” adds Kevin. “We’re here to support them.”
While Nick’s daughter Malti Marie is just 17 months old and has yet to start school, the “Sucker” singer, 30, has some timeless advice for his child: “Just be yourself.” “There’s a lot of factors when it comes to just coming into your own skin and figuring out who you are,” says Nick, who shares Malti with wife Priyanka Chopra Jonas. “And if you just take one step at a time and do your best not to get overwhelmed, I think that that’s the best path forward,” reported People.

“I want them to be themselves,” echoes Joe, 33, who is dad to daughters Willa, 2, and an 11-month-old baby, with wife Sophie Turner. “I really don’t need them to think that their dad or their uncles are the coolest in the world,” he adds. “That’s not what it’s all about.”Advertisement
While the artists have plenty of wisdom to pass on to their girls, they strive to avoid offering each other parenting advice. “I think to each his own and more so than ever, we definitely don’t give any advice to each other in regards to parenting,” says Kevin.
As per People, “that’s a big golden rule that we’ve had, unintentionally, but it’s worked out so far. We’re definitely going to keep it going,” he continues. “I think that’s what is so nice about parenting is you can, and no one can tell you differently.”
Nick adds, “We live pretty public lives and so much of our life is on display and that’s going to be our reality for a while now.” “But we do our best to keep our circle pretty tight and to make sure that we’ve got our private moments and especially with our kids and all that. Because they didn’t sign up for this, it’s just what their parents do.”

As Kevin FaceTimes Alena to encourage her, her uncles Joe and Nick join in to tell her to dream big. The campaign jumps through scenes from Alena’s “Best School Day Ever,” culminating with a performance by the Jonas Brothers.Advertisement
“It was so fun working with Alena and Valentina, they’re superstars,” says Kevin. Nick adds, “They killed it.” “They stole the show,” continues Kevin. “It’s their commercial, not ours.” “It’s really fun for me. Where I would traditionally be on set by myself, now I’m doing it with my family and it’s a really great way to spend a little extra time together.”
“It’s great to find these partnerships that celebrate our fans and that next generation of young fans and it’s just the perfect fit for us,” Joe tells People. “And a household name like The Children’s Place, also Jersey founded, like us.

From authoritarian to permissive: Unraveling four major parenting stylesPremium Story,"When it comes to parenting, there are no rules. But there are different parenting styles that can affect your relationship with your kids. It is vital to consistently reevaluate your parenting style to ensure that it’s fostering healthy growth and development.
Talking about the same, Dr Vishnu Priya Bhagirath, a counselling psychologist said, “Parenting style is the overall approach, attitude, and patterns of behavior that parents exhibit in raising and nurturing their children. It includes the mix of strategies, beliefs and values that guide parenting. Parenting styles are influenced by cultural background, personal experiences and individual beliefs.”
Similarly, Dr Foram Matalia, Psychologist, Bhatia Hospital, Mumbai said that these styles influence feelings of security, the personal meaning given to experiences, and the ability to develop and maintain intimacy with others.Advertisement
Recently, Dr Santosh Yadav, a paediatrician took to Instagram to share various parenting styles. “Did you know that your parenting style reflects on your child’s behaviour? If your child is stubborn, angry, loves everyone, listens to you or is a well-behaved child, it depends on your parenting style,” he said in the post.
Take a look.

Further, he added that there are 4 types of parenting styles. First is authoritative, in which you are very responsive, you listen to the child, you ask questions, and you activate the left brain. This is best.
“Authoritative parent follow what is widely understood as the preferred approach. Such parents are more pragmatic and flexible. They set clear boundaries. but also encourage children’s independence within those limits. Discipline in such families may be more supportive than punitive, and as children get older, their independence increases. Children of authoritative parents may have more highly developed self-control and self-reliance,” noted Dr Matalia.
Second is authoritarian, where you are the boss and you expect the child to do everything you say. This is not good.
“An authoritarian parent seeks to maintain a high level of control over their children. They may set and adhere to a strict set of rules and are more likely to support and take part in corporal punishment such as spanking. Children of highly authoritarian parents may struggle socially and may be likely to become authoritarian parents themselves,” said Dr Matalia.Advertisement
Third is permissive in which you do whatever the child says. You listen to everything the child says. That is also not good.

“Indulgent (or permissive) parents may be attentive and warm but may not set many rules for their children. They may prioritise being their child’s friend over being their parent. Research suggests that the children of permissive parents may show higher levels of creativity but may also feel entitled and be more interested in taking rather than giving in their own relationships,” shared Dr Matalia.
Fourth is uninvolved or neglectful. This is very rare in India.
“Neglectful parents (also known as uninvolved or disengaged) take on a limited parenting role. They may not spend as much time as other parents in conversation, play, or other activities, and may not bother to set many house rules. Some children of neglectful parents may resist rules outside of the home and struggle with self-control,” explained Dr Matalia.
How do parenting styles affect a child’s behaviour?Advertisement
For children, parents are the “all powerful” center of their universe. Parenting styles have a deep impact on a child’s behavior. They shape the child’s understanding of themselves, social relations, and the world around them. Children internalise parents’ negative opinion and incorporate it into their view of themselves.
Explaining this, Bhagirath said, “An authoritative parenting style, characterised by warmth, clear expectations, and consistent discipline, tends to foster children who exhibit self-control, confidence, and a healthy level of independence. But permissive parenting styles, with minimal structure and few limits, can lead to children displaying impulsivity, difficulty following rules, and challenges with self-regulation. Authoritarian parenting, which emphasises strict rules and punishment, may result in children displaying lower self-esteem, rebellion, or even aggression. Neglectful parenting, where parental involvement and attention are lacking, can contribute to feelings of insecurity, emotional withdrawal, and behavioral problems.”

As for the best parenting approach, she said that there is no universally best parenting style. Effectiveness of a parenting style depends on various factors, including the child’s temperament, cultural context and individual needs. “However, an authoritative parenting style tends to promote positive outcomes. The main reason being that it allows a healthy balance between nurturing and setting clear expectations, fostering self-esteem, self-control and positive social skills,” the expert concluded.

Monsoon health: How to maintain a nutrient-rich diet for your kids this seasonPremium Story,"Monsoon season brings fun and relief from the hot summer heat. However, they are a time to be more cautious with the kids as they are more vulnerable to seasonal health problems such as cough, cold, flu, diarrhoea, and mosquito-borne infections such as dengue, malaria, and chikungunya when exposed to rain.
Maintaining a nutrient-rich diet for kids during the monsoon season is essential to keep them healthy and protected from common ailments. 
Talking about the same, Samiksha Kalra, Head Clinical Nutritionist, Rosewalk Healthcare said that parents should incorporate a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables into their child’s diet as it provides essential vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that boost immunity. Advertisement
“Include citrus fruits, Indian gooseberries (amla), bell peppers, mushrooms, nuts, seeds and yoghurt in a child’s diet. Keep children hydrated by encouraging them to drink plenty of water throughout the day. Opt for whole grains like brown rice, oats, and millet as they are rich in fibre, vitamins, and minerals and provide sustained energy. Prepare warm, nourishing soups using seasonal vegetables, lentils, and herbs. These soups are not only comforting but also provide essential nutrients and hydration. Ensure adequate protein in the child’s diet as it is essential for growth, development, and immunity,” she informed.
During the monsoon, there is an increased risk of food contamination. “Ensuring proper hygiene and food safety practices is a must, such as washing fruits and vegetables thoroughly, cooking food thoroughly, and minimising the consumption of processed and packaged foods as they are often low in nutrients and high in unhealthy fats, sugar and additives,” said Kalra.

Adding to this, Trupti Padhi, Dietician and Clinical Nutritionist, consults on Practo said that during the monsoon season, it is crucial to prioritise nutrient-rich foods for children, particularly those containing carbohydrates, fibre and essential vitamins. Advertisement
“These dietary elements help enhance their immunity and protect against stomach infections, cold, and cough. Since many children can be selective eaters, it is essential to provide them with a variety of food options. For instance, if a child dislikes plain rice, substitutions and modifications can be made by incorporating a mix of vegetables, paneer, chicken, or eggs. This ensures that they receive a well-balanced meal with the correct proportion of fibre, protein, carbohydrates and other nutrition on a daily basis. Another critical aspect to remember is hydration as it can flush out toxins from the body, warm water especially will be very beneficial for kids as it can also help with digestion,” she noted.

*Make sure you are feeding your baby in a comfortable time slot, so that you do not have to rush things and dedicate that time only to feeding your baby without a rush.Advertisement
*You should make sure that your baby is sitting straight on a firm surface; the baby should not be laying down or sitting in an inclined position. For example, on mother’s lap, floor or chairs.
*Before feeding make sure your baby is not too full nor hungry. For instance, you can offer solids to your baby after 30-40 minutes of breastfeeding.
*Try to feed your baby with different varieties of food; do not just feed the same food every day to the child.

Uptick in number of adenovirus cases among childrenPremium Story,"Adenoviruses are known to invite eye, stomach, and respiratory infections. There is a significant rise in child admissions with respiratory ailments due to a new strain of adenovirus that is more transmissible and is behind the spike in cases.
It is a highly contagious virus leading to illnesses such as the common cold, bronchitis, and pneumonia. These infections cause symptoms such as fever, cough, runny nose, and pink eye. Adenovirus infections lead to mild to moderate symptoms in children. Those children with weak immune systems are more prone to it.
Explaining the same, Dr Suresh Birajdar, Neonatologist & Paediatrician, Motherhood Hospital, Kharghar, said, “Adenovirus is a common virus causing infection of respiratory tract (nose, throat, trachea and lungs). The symptoms consist of fever, cough and cold. These symptoms are at times similar to influenza or even Covid,” however, he stressed that the differentiating symptoms in case of adenovirus are presence of conjunctivitis (red eye) and enlarged lymph nodes. The fever may last longer than a week in adenovirus infection.Advertisement
For diagnosis, a special test (PCR) can be done to confirm adenovirus, however, the diagnosis based on clinical symptoms is adequate for treating most of the patients, said Dr Birajdar. “There is no specific course of treatment. Children get better with supportive treatment such as paracetamol for fever control, hydration and rest. There is no specific vaccine available for dealing with adenovirus. To keep infection at bay, children should avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with contaminated hands and regularly use soap or sanitizer to wash their hands. Also, do not go to crowded places, or come in contact with sick people,” he added.
Further, Dr Sheetal Radia, ENT & Head, and Neck Onco Surgeon, Wockhardt Hospitals, Mira Road said, “Adenovirus is commonly seen in children of age group 3-10 years post-pandemic. We all are nose breathers, but many children have mouth breathing. This child may have adenoid enlargement, which is known as Adenodigest. It may be due to an infection that is adenovirus. These children repeatedly fall sick with cough cold breathlessness episodes. Approximately 60% of children are having repeated cold and cough infections and are not getting cured despite prescribing medications.”

3 simple ways to increase your child’s social IQPremium Story,"The social IQ of toddlers and preschoolers during this stage refers to their ability to understand and navigate their social interactions effectively. During the developmental stage, children are actively learning and try acquiring social skills, which help the children form the foundations of their future relationships. Though social IQ is not a standardised measure like intelligence quotient (IQ), it needs to encompass various aspects of social competence and emotional intelligence.
Toddlers typically begin to exhibit social behaviours such as sharing, taking turns and showing empathy towards others during this time. Children learn to recognise facial expressions, interpret emotions and engage in basic communication. As they progress into the preschool years, their social IQ continues to develop as they refine their social skills.
Preschoolers expand their social horizons by engaging in more complex play, cooperative activities, and peer interactions. They start to understand social norms, rules and expectations, while also learning to resolve conflicts and negotiate with their peers. Preschool years are crucial for building essential social competencies like empathy, perspective-taking, and understanding social hierarchies.Advertisement

Teach your children about the power of choice.
During toddlerhood, teach and regularly reinforce the concept of choices to them
To have any choice means:
*Several options to review and choose from
*In a short time, the goal should be to choose the most responsible and helpful choice
*You do not need to be perfect, try and practice to give your best
*Depending on the choice that you take, will have certain consequences, it can be good or bad
Ways to teach these skills:Advertisement
*Try to give your toddler some simple choices to make to practice this skill
*You should try to point out other’s choices and its consequence for your child
*Always try to share the thought process of your choices with your child
*Read books to your child which teach such concept
Teach your child ‘why’ certain people make certain choices
Certain choices taken by some people have a negative impact on your child, start expanding the conversation by helping your toddler understand why someone might have made the choices.  In the meantime, it does not excuse that person’s behaviour (even if the speculation is true), but it eventually helps your child to expand their understanding of others.
It also helps the child to prevent personalising other’s behaviour.
For example, if someone at your child’s school calls your toddler a mean word.
After listening and understanding their feelings, help them expand the conversation by asking questions like:Advertisement
“I wonder what they might have been feeling when they say this word…”
“I wonder their perspective of the story…”
Also, try to teach them about others’ feelings when they feel low. They might not have the skills needed to communicate those feelings, so they often lash out. There are many different possible reasons why people make certain choices. Unfortunately, what they did might be unkind to others and no one deserves to be called such names.

*Take your time and listen to your child, try to understand their perspective
*Acknowledging their feelings and choices
*Point out their body language
The fact is relationships are complicated and understanding the nuance takes teaching and experience.

Soha Ali Khan opens up about the ‘unconditional love’ between Sharmila Tagore and Inaaya; expert shares the importance of grandparents in a child’s lifePremium Story,"Grandparents play a significant role in the lives of their grandchildren, offering a unique and valuable bond that enhances their upbringing. The importance of grandparents in a child’s life can be highlighted in several ways.
Actor Soha Ali Khan recently took the Instagram to share “the most unconditional love” between her mother Sharmila Tagore and daughter Inaaya. “Time with grandparents is so precious ❤️ the chance to learn from someone so far apart in years from you (and this works both ways), a second chance at parenting, the most unconditional love and the purest fun – and a chance for me to put my feet up and finally get that pedicure!!” the caption read.

The role of grandparents in a child’s life
Grandparents serve as a bridge between generations, passing on the family traditions, values, and cultural heritage to their grandchildren. They provide a link to the past–sharing stories, experiences and wisdom that enrich the lives of the children. This cross-generational connection fosters a deeper understanding of family roots in the children which helps for strengthening family bonds.Advertisement
Moreover, grandparents often try to spend time with their grandchildren, whenever possible. The activities that they engage in like reading, storytelling or gardening, not only help to create long-lasting memories but also enhance the child’s intellectual, creative and social development.

They also act as role models, imparting life lessons and guidance based on their own experiences to their grandchildren. They offer a different perspective and alternative sources of advice, helping children navigate challenges and make informed decisions.
In an interview with indianexpress.com, Vishnu Priya Bhagirath, a psychologist said, “The absence of grandparents in a child’s life can potentially have a negative impact on their development, particularly in certain situations or circumstances. When grandparents are absent, children may miss out on the emotional support, unconditional love, and guidance they provide. This absence can create a void in the child’s life, potentially leading to feelings of loneliness, insecurity or a lack of belonging.”
 Additionally, she said that the absence of intergenerational connections may limit the child’s exposure to cultural heritage, family traditions and the sense of continuity that grandparents bring. “A close relationship with grandparents brings numerous benefits to grandchildren, fostering their holistic development and well-being,” she informed.Advertisement

How to manage conflicts between parent and grandparent
Bhagirath explained that it is important for grandparents to recognise the significance of their presence and the unique contributions they can make. “Grandparents act as living links to the past, offering valuable insights into societal changes and personal growth. But one common source of tension is differing parenting styles and expectations between grandparents and parents. It can be solved through effective communication and respectful dialogue, which is vital in navigating these differences, ensuring open discussions and shared understandings of boundaries and roles.”
Additionally, conflicts may emerge due to generational gaps or lifestyle disparities, where conflicting views on technology, cultural norms or values may arise. During such instances encouraging open-mindedness and acknowledging diverse perspectives can bridge these gaps and facilitate mutual respect.”
Concluding, she noted that grandparents serve as mentors, sharing their life experiences and offering valuable guidance, which helps children develop resilience and navigate life’s challenges.Advertisement

Study reveals conflict in marriage less harmful for kids when dad keeps it constructive,"Conflict is unavoidable in marriages. When it erupts in families with children, anxious or angry parents might take their pain out on the kids, projecting their anger or withdrawing emotionally or physically. Children’s socioemotional development might suffer in the worst-case scenario. However, how parents, particularly men, cope with marital disputes can have an impact on their children, according to a recent study by researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
“In the past, marital conflict has always been considered a negative thing in reference to various aspects of child development. But what’s more important than having conflict is how people deal with it. Our study looked at whether constructive conflict resolution could buffer some of the negative influence of marital conflict on parenting practices,” said lead author Qiujie Gong, a doctoral student in the Department of Human Development and Family Studies (HDFS) in the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences at Illinois.
Some studies have shown father-child relationships may be more impacted by conflict than mother-child relationships and can lead to negative development for kids. That’s why the authors chose to focus on fathers in their study.Advertisement
“We wanted to pay more attention to fathers, because while mothers have always been considered the main caregiver, fathers can also significantly influence children’s development,” Gong said.
The authors, including HDFS professors Karen Kramer and Kelly Tu, accessed a longitudinal dataset from the U.S. Department of Education tracing children’s experiences from 9 months to kindergarten. Recognizing the importance of the preschool years for learning socioemotional skills, they analyzed the subset of data for families with 4-year-olds and, controlling for mother’s parenting styles, honed in on fathers’ responses to survey questions about marital conflict and resolution strategies. Building links in a chain, they connected fathers’ reports of conflict to their parenting practices, then to the socioemotional impacts of those practices on children.
“Beyond looking separately at mothers, fathers, and conflict, as previous studies have done, we put it all together in one model, not only to see the family as an interconnected system but also to not forget the father: How his perceptions of conflict and approaches to resolution affect child socioemotional development,” said Kramer. “That’s the uniqueness of this study.” Analyzing a diverse sample of 3,955 heterosexual families with resident fathers, the authors found when fathers reported more frequent marital conflict, it increased their parenting stress and decreased their warmth toward their child. According to the analysis, those factors then decreased the child’s socioemotional skills reported by mothers in the surveys.
Gong emphasizes preschool-age children are at a crucial stage for developing socioemotional skills. These early experiences set the stage for later peer relationships, mental health, and more, so parents of small children should consider how their interactions may spill over to their kids, she says.
Next, Gong factored in how fathers resolved conflict.Advertisement
“We found fathers who reported using more constructive conflict resolution – like open communication and reaching compromise, as opposed to hitting, criticizing, or throwing things – showed more involvement and warmth toward their kids, compared to their counterparts,” she said.
Not surprisingly, children benefited from these warmer interactions with their dads.
“Fathers using constructive conflict resolution led to more parental involvement, which led to more positive child development,” Kramer said. “Destructive conflict has the opposite effect on kids.” In the end, Gong says parents shouldn’t shy away from conflict. Instead, what’s more important is to find constructive resolution strategies that minimize stress and maintain a father’s ability to interact warmly with his children.
“If we could have more clinical or educational programs that teach parents how to openly communicate with each other, how to listen to each other, and maintain good relationships with family members, it might be effective in promoting healthier family and child development,” Gong said. “It’s also important to not only consider the amount of parenting, but the quality of parenting. Even if fathers have a lot of involvement, if their warmth is super low, that might not be beneficial for the child.” Kramer adds that although the study focused exclusively on married couples, fathers in other family arrangements can still learn from the study.Advertisement

“These lessons don’t only apply to married couples. In fact, I would say they are even more important when you are not living together, or you’re separated or divorced,” she said. “You might have even more conflict in those cases, so the process of solving it might be even more important to the development of the child.”

Are your child airway’s swollen and narrow? Here’s what you need to knowPremium Story,"Parents with children who have asthma face unique challenges as they strive to provide a safe and healthy environment for their little ones. They not only witness their children struggling to breathe during asthma attacks but also constantly monitor potential triggers that may worsen their condition.
Pediatric asthma is a condition in which a child’s airways become swollen and narrow, making it difficult for children to breathe properly. It is a chronic lung condition that affects a significant number of children worldwide.
According to World Health Organization (WHO), asthma affected an estimated 262 million people in 2019 and caused 455,000 deaths. Children who are suffering from asthma are usually exposed to triggers like pollen, dust, or cold air, and that makes their airways become even more inflamed, causing symptoms like wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.Advertisement
These symptoms in children can vary in severity, from mild to severe, and can affect a child’s daily activities and sleep. With proper management, including medications and avoiding triggers, children with asthma can lead normal and active lives.

What causes asthma in children?
Dr Poonam Sidana, Director Neonatology and Pediatrics at C K Birla Hospital, Delhi told indianexpress.com, “A child can suffer from different kinds of allergies like outside exposure to dust mites, pet dander, pollen, mould, and cockroach droppings, which can cause harm to children who are sensitive. These allergens can be threatening and can increase symptoms asthma well. Children exposed to these allergens are at the risk of developing asthma.”
She further explained that if a child is suffering from respiratory infections, it can lead to asthma episodes in children, including the common cold, the flu, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). “These can make asthma symptom aggravate by inflaming the airways and making them more hyperresponsive.”Advertisement
Moreover, children exposed to tobacco smoke, both during pregnancy and after birth, have a higher chance of getting asthma. Air pollution can also cause asthma in children, including particulate matter, industrial pollutants, and automobile emissions. Poor air quality can also inflame the airways and trigger asthma symptoms, Dr Sidana says.

Dr Sidana also shared that statistics suggest that around 1 in 10 children have asthma. “The most frequent kind of asthma management for kids is inhalation therapy using nebuliser or spacer is very safe and quick acting. It delivers smaller doses as compared to oral medicine and fewer side effects. It is regarded as the gold standard for asthma care. This treatment includes inhaling medicine into the child’s lungs, which can quickly and effectively relieve the symptoms of asthma. The two common drugs that are used in inhalers are Corticosteroids and bronchodilators. In an emergency, such as an asthma attack, bronchodilators are typically utilised because they offer immediate relief,” she informed.
She suggests that it is essential to create an asthma-friendly environment by keeping indoor spaces clean, dust-free, and well-ventilated. “Mosquito repellents are also an important trigger. Avoid carpets, soft toys, wall hanging etc. which can gather dust and mould. Avoid dry dusting, use a vacuum cleaner or wet mopping. She further recommends parents to make appointments with your child’s doctor on a frequent basis to monitor lung function. This makes it possible to identify any change in the symptoms of asthma early and to manage the condition appropriately to avoid exacerbations,” she added.
Here are ways to prevent asthma in your child, according to the expert:Advertisement

Here is the simple 3-step formula:
Step 1: Connect (Give lots of positive attention)
Parents’ attention is the most important and critical part of parenting, which is often misplaced. Giving your child (if not all) attention when your child is misbehaving is a common parenting mistake. The problem with this is your child comes to learn they get the most control, attention and recognition following misbehaviour, not appropriate behaviour.
Step 2: Regulate emotions (yours then theirs)Advertisement
Harsh truth- A parent cannot help their child regulate their emotions, if they themselves do not know how to control their emotions in the first place. No one can be perfect at this; one needs to be with their children in this journey. A child can then be taught this skill through emotional coaching.

*Help your child learn to label their emotions: With words like “I feel sad, I feel mad, I feel happy.”
*Explore solutions together: Help them problem solve
Step 3: Guide behaviour
*Plan consequence ahead of time
*Communicate consequences to your child when everyone is calm and connected

Take Time: Game on or game over?Premium Story,"Everyone of all ages enjoys playing video games on their computers. Children and teenagers, in particular, spend more time indoors playing video games than engaging in outdoor activities. Even while some video games are instructional, there is a growing market for games that may emphasise unfavourable themes like violence, crime and disdain for law and authority. Cooperative, competitive, or violent video games are the three general subcategories of computer games. As a result, given the appeal of the latter two, there are worries about the potential impact that these digital game genres may have on a child’s psychosocial development.
Positive and negative effects
Children and adults alike get addicted to these video games. It has become the favourite pastime for everybody. Getting addicted to video games is not restricted to children alone, even adults get drawn to it. But video games has its own positive and negative impacts on children. It improves the reflexes and skills of a child. Puzzle-solving video games raise the level of dexterity in children. It keeps the child skillfully busy, making him more confident and gadget-friendly.
The negative effects of video games include negligence of other responsibilities such as schoolwork and other activities which results in poor academic and social performance. Staying glued to a screen, computer, mobile phone etc. to play video games for a longer duration of time results in health problems like obesity and poor or weak eyesight. Playing video games for a long time can cause aggressive behaviour and thoughts and other psychological problems in a child. The role of parents and elders is very important in monitoring the duration of playtime and the types of video games being played.
How can a parent help?Advertisement
This doesn’t necessarily imply that your child shouldn’t play video games, but there are certain things you can do as a parent to encourage a positive gaming relationship for your child:

Establish boundaries and keep computers and video-game consoles out of your child’s bedroom.
Make a timetable for the permitted game time. Giving timely reminders during playtime is suggested. For instance, “You have 15 more minutes till game time is done.”
If you are a parent having trouble with your child’s videogames addiction, be sure to give them the proper punishments and rewards when they comply.
Before allowing your children to play video games, take into account the game’s rating. Some games are improper for children and can exacerbate troublesome behaviour.
Use parental control tools that let you set passwords on your children’s accounts to restrict and control what they are exposed to online.
Explain to your children how to keep their technology and personal information safe by being cautious when opening files that are linked to emails or instant chats.
Make and employ secure passwords.
Use antivirus and anti-spyware software. As a parent, guard the administrator password and monitor your child’s online gaming time.
It’s crucial to set an example for your children when playing video games if you are a parent who enjoys doing so.
The key is consistency — to encourage your child to behave more appropriately while playing games, try to maintain consistency in your rules and their enforcement.

ALSO READ | Is your child addicted to video games? Here’s how you can tell
While competitive and violent video games have been shown to encourage aggressive behaviour in children and adolescents, cooperative games have been linked to positive effects. Long-term gaming has also been linked to a rise in addictive behaviour and a decline in psychological health. As a result, it will be crucial for parents to keep an eye on how much time their children spend playing video games and what kinds of games they play in order to prevent addiction and internalising problems in children. Psychosocial development as a whole refers to the development of an individual’s personality, which involves changes in and the acquisition of social skills and psychosocial behaviour, as influenced by environmental and social factors.

Moderated screen time or none at all? Which is better for kids? Find outPremium Story,"In today’s modern world, with digital devices widely prevalent, screen time has increased for everyone. But is it healthy for kids? Excessiveness is never healthy. When given too much access to screen time, kids may become dependent on it and even obsessed with it. However, the solution to deprive them of screen time altogether may not be a good one. 
Aditi Murarkar, parenting expert, shared on Instagram her views about blocking screen time completely from kids – and she disapproves, with reason. Murarka gives a balanced argument which looks at multiple sides before coming to a conclusion–why screen time is bad for children, why parents think cutting them off from it might help and why it does not.

A post shared by Aditi Murarka | Parenting Support (@spectra_mom)


Why would one want screen time for kids above two years?
Screen time not only impacts the cognitive development of a child but also interferes with their sleeping patterns. Moreover, children often lose interest in other aspects of their lives such as independent play and allow screen times to be their default nannies. For parents, it becomes very difficult to monitor what content is being consumed by their children, often leading to the children being introduced to inappropriate content. Finally, all of this may amalgamate into overall irritability, tantrums, or behavioural issues in the kids. Advertisement

Despite this, Murarkar suggests not cutting kids off their screen time privileges completely. She says that it might not have the desired effect. Moreover, doing that might not even be entirely possible as screens are everywhere. Children will remain curious and through hidden means will ultimately access screen time without your knowledge, approval or monitoring. As such these might lead to greater power struggles in the household– the children feeling cut off from the world at school or elsewhere, and finally the kids rebelling against you under peer pressure.
So, what can you do instead?

Murarkar suggests allowing children to develop a healthy bond with screen time. She says each parent should harness the positive possibilities screen time offers. Using screen time correctly and with a positive attitude can boost your child’s concentration, creativity, imagination and help with learning processes as well. 
Dr Gautami Nagabhirava, Senior Neuropsychiatrist, Kamineni Hospitals, Hyderabad agreed that by
implementing responsible screen time guidelines and being mindful of potential risks, parents can help mitigate long-term negative effects. She said, “Regular communication, adaptability and finding the right balance between screen use and other activities are key to supporting children’s healthy development in the digital age.”
Dr. Nagabhirava suggested that a good way to deal with children’s screen time is to change the restrictions with time. Moreover, she said priotising quality content over quantity is more important for children. “Choose educational and age-appropriate content that stimulates learning, creativity, and social skills. Seek trusted sources like educational websites and interactive apps,” she informed.Advertisement
In addition to these two, Dr. Nagabhirava advises that you co-view and co-play with your children while they are on the digital device. “Engage in screen time together, actively participating and discussing what they watch or play. This enhances learning and encourages healthy media habits.”
Some other suggestions the doctor has are establishing screen-free zones in the house and emphasising offline activity and be mutually inclusive. She said, “Designate specific areas or periods where screens are not allowed, such as mealtimes, bedrooms, and family gatherings. This promotes social interaction and maintains a balance between screen time and other activities.”
She further said that modelling healthy screen habits to your children so they can learn from you is an active step you yourself can take. “Set a positive example by limiting your own screen time and engaging in non-screen activities. Children learn from observation, so be mindful of your own technology use,” she concluded.

Busting potty-training mythsPremium Story,"One of the major challenges for new parents is to teach their child to potty train. Every child is unique, their development is different, and their habits vary. As such, not every child can be potty trained in the same ways, with the same drills. If you have read books, watched guides, and asked friends and family for help and it still is not working out for you, there is nothing to worry about. Potty training might be a hard task, but it is not impossible, and your child will certainly learn it.
Dr Mona, pediatrician and toddler mom, has some tips and tricks in an Instagram post she shared about busting potty-training misconceptions.

A post shared by Dr. Mona | Baby+Toddler Health✨Development✨Parenting (@pedsdoctalk) 


First and foremost, she says that there is not one single age where a child can get ready for potty training, and it is important for the child to be ready. While you can start reading up on it and discussing it with your kid from 18 months to two years old, if the process starts later or takes longer, it is absolutely normal. Sometimes, if your child is not taking to the training as you might have expected, you might want to ruminate on whether they are still too young for it, or if they need a different method.
The biggest myth, the doctor says, is that every child can be potty trained in three days. Though she agrees that this might work on some kids, it is a stressful method, and it is not uncommon for kids to take longer. Ideally, it can take from three days to two weeks and parents should not allow the three days drill to backfire on them. Advertisement
Additionally, Dr Mona suggests that contrary to popular belief, rewards systems can actually help with the potty-training process. People believe that the reward system might make the child dependent on a reward to use the toilet; however, the expert says that it can instead, help with getting the ball rolling. However, she also says that if you use this system, you must phase it out. “It is important to understand your child’s vibe to know if a reward system is right for them (and for you).”
Commenting on the method of training children during nights as well as days, Dr Mona says that it might not be such a good idea. “Many children don’t have the bladder maturity to stay dry overnight until five years of age. So, if you’re training a child younger than this, you can focus on days first and then nights.” She says that it is easier to potty train a child who is awake than a child who is half asleep.

Finally, she goes to the most questionable myth: once potty trained, there will be no accidents. She strongly suggests that there can, and it is absolutely normal for that to happen. She says that accidents or regressions for any toddler is normal, and something all parents should expect rather than be surprised by. “Accidents can happen if they are occupied or distracted…regressions can happen with major life changes.” Dr Mona says that both are common and can be corrected with positive reinforcement and consistency.
Dr Kanchan S Channawar, Senior Pediatrician & Pediatric Intensivist, Kamineni Hospitals, Hyderabad while agreeing to all of the above, also said that establishing a routine with your child might further help the process. She said, “Establish a consistent routine around using the potty. Encourage your child to sit on the potty at regular intervals, such as after meals or upon waking from naps.”Advertisement
While dealing with accidents, she suggested that parents’ response is very important for the method to be successful. “Respond calmly and avoid scolding or shaming your child. Instead, guide them in understanding what happened and reinforce the proper use of the potty.”

When should salt be given to babies (and how much)?Premium Story,"Baby food–a truly challenging subject for all new parents. What should you put in it, what should you not put in it, how you can prepare it, and when to prepare; all of it might confuse you and leave you hopeless. But the biggest question can be about salt. A staple for all dishes prepared, we can hardly imagine our lives without salt. However, can you feed it to your baby whenever?
Baby digestive systems are not like our own. They are much more complex and sensitive. You must have heard doctors and older parents constantly nagging you about being careful with what you put into your baby’s food. Salt is one such ingredient that you must be cautious of. Though a wonder to our dishes, it can have long term effects on the digestive systems of babies. Therefore, before you add even a pinch of it to your baby’s meals, you must know when, how and what to do.
Dr. Santosh Yadav, in a reel shared on Instagram, helps out with this exact problem. He explains why salt can be harmful and how it can be so. Moreover, he also talks about alternatives to salt for baby food.

A post shared by Dr.Santosh Yadav | (MD,FIAP,DASII) (@parentingtips_surat) 


In the reel Dr Yadav says that babies up to 12 months should not consume any salt at all. This is because a baby’s kidneys are not as strong as adults and will not be able to process it out. Therefore, this may lead to kidney damage which can be a lifelong problem. Moreover, he says that the child, in the future, might suffer from hypertension if he consumes too much salt in infancy. Advertisement
He further says that babies’ taste buds are automatically more inclined towards neutral taste or sweetness. So, if a baby is introduced to salt too early in infancy, it might make the child more inclined to saltiness later in life which can, again, lead to hypertension. 
Dr Kanchan S Channawar, Senior Pediatrician and Pediatric Intensivist, Kamineni Hospitals, Hyderabad added some other problems consuming excessive salt for infants might have. “The intake of excessive salt can result in increased thirst and dehydration. In the long term, high salt consumption may contribute to the onset of high blood pressure in adulthood.

Instead, Dr Yadav recommends that babies from 0 to 12 months should avoid salt altogether, while babies from one to four years only consume half a teaspoon of salt per day. “Babies from one to four years old only require half a teaspoon of salt each day,” he added.
Dr Channawar though agrees that babies below one year should not consume salt at all, she also says that babies from two to four years should have less salt than recommended by Dr. Yadav. She said, “For children between the ages of 2 and 4 years old, the recommended daily intake of salt is about 2-3 grams (less than half a teaspoon). It’s important to note that this recommendation includes both the salt naturally present in foods and any added salt.”Advertisement
She explained, “At this age, children are still developing their taste preferences and habits, so it’s beneficial to limit their intake of salt. Excessive salt consumption can lead to health issues, such as increased blood pressure and a preference for salty foods.”
Dr. Yadav suggests you use other ingredients like garlic, onion, cumin, pepper or thyme to add taste to your baby’s food. “You can use all of these ingredients to bring taste to your baby’s food. Please don’t add salt to your baby’s meals before 12 months of age,” concluded the doctor. 
In addition, Dr. Channawar suggested using different kinds of herbs and spices in baby food as well. “When preparing baby food, there are numerous alternatives to salt that can enhance its taste. One option is to incorporate various herbs and spices, such as cinnamon, ginger, thyme, oregano, and basil. It’s important to introduce these flavors gradually to monitor for any potential allergies or adverse reactions. Moreover, since babies’ tastebuds prefer sweetness, ingredients like mashed bananas or applesauce with natural sweetness are also good for baby meals,” she concluded.

Vitamin D deficiency more common in children with TB: Study,"Vitamin D deficiency is more common in children with tuberculosis (TB) than those not infected by the bacterial disease, according to a study conducted in hospitalised patients in Telangana.
The study, recently published in the journal Cureus, also found that a severe form of vitamin D deficiency — less than 10 nanogrammes per millilitre (ng/mL) — was higher among children with TB.
The team, including researchers from Osmania Medical College (OMC) and Government Medical College, Siddipet, carried out the study in a tertiary care centre at Niloufer Hospital, Telangana over a period of one year and five months.Advertisement
A total of 70 children with TB between the ages of 6 months and 12 years were included in the study.
The participants were divided into three groups according to age: 1-4 years, 5-8 years, and 9-12 years.
“The mean vitamin D level in our study was 10.43 ng/ml among the cases and 22.84 ng/mL among the controls,” the authors of the study noted.
“The study found that prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) was high among children with TB than with controls. In addition, the severe form of VDD was higher among children with TB,” they added.
The researchers noted that clinicians should be aware of associated malnutrition and low socioeconomic status as risk factors for severe vitamin D deficiencies among them.
Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most devastating and widespread infections in the world. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in developing countries, the researchers said.Advertisement
TB is caused by mycobacteria. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the most frequently found organism, and to a lesser extent, so are M. bovis and M. africanum.

Is talcum powder your go-to product for your baby? Think again!Premium Story,"Talcum powder has been an age-old solution to all problems caused by heat–sweating, rashes and more. It is one of the most common items used especially on babies for a number of reasons. However, it might interest you to know that it is not all safe and secure as you might think. Of course, we think that baby products are the safest in the world, so how can talcum powder (of all things) be harmful? It is!
Doctor and mom blogger Parul Upreti Saili shares in an Instagram reel the harmful effects of talcum powder and recommends to strictly avoid it. In addition, Dr Saili suggests various alternatives to using talcum powder for baby skin issues such as sweating, nappy rashes and prickly heat.

A post shared by DR. Parul Upreti Saili | Millennial Doctor-Mom Blogger (@themillennialdoc)


She explains that talcum powder consists of the clay mineral talc. This mineral is comprised of magnesium, silica and oxygen. Talc is mined in close proximity to asbestos which has carcinogenic (cancer-causing) potential. Therefore, there always remains a risk that during mining, the talc mineral may get contaminated with asbestos. If so, using talcum powder regularly may cause cancer like genital or ovarian cancer, especially if parents use talcum powder to keep baby’s genitals dry. 
Dr. Saili gives another pertinent reason to avoid talcum powder – inhaling bits of talc can lead to respiratory irritation and problems. If you or your baby accidentally inhale talcum powder, you and your baby might suffer from wheezing, shortness of breath, chest congestion or chronic cough.  Advertisement
Yes, it is worrisome. All those talcum powder packages you had needs to be put away. But what can you do in place of it? What can you use otherwise? You might be wondering this. Dr Saili has some ideas about this as well. 
Sweat
To keep your baby’s skin dry, instead of using talcum powder, you can use a soft towel or cotton cloth. You can also keep your baby in loose fitting clothes, keep her in a cool area, give her a bath or remove a layer of clothing. Dr Saili explains that powder, including talcum powder, does not prevent sweating. Therefore, it is never a long-term solution.
Nappy rashes
Nappy rashes happen if a baby is in a soiled or wet nappy for long hours or is sweating through the nappy bands for long periods of time. Instead of using talcum powder to calm the irritation, you can make sure to frequently change the nappy. You can also apply zinc oxide creams or petroleum jelly as a barrier cream.

Prickly heatAdvertisement
Prickly heat rashes are caused if sweat is allowed to stay on the skin for too long. In order to prevent this without using talcum powder, you can dry your baby’s folds with a soft absorbent towel. Remember that no type of powder prevents sweating, therefore, there can be several alternatives to using talcum powder. 
Dr. Ramdas, Senior Dermatologist at Kamineni Hospitals, Hyderabad recommended using other powders instead of talcum powder. He said, “There are a number of safe and effective alternatives to baby powder that can be used to keep babies’ skin dry and prevent rashes. These include cornstarch, baking soda, arrowroot powder, kaolin clay, rice flour or oat flour. These powders are all safe for babies and do not contain any harmful ingredients. They are also just as effective as baby powder at keeping skin dry and preventing rashes.”
In addition, he said that we can use zinc oxide cream, petroleum jelly, oatmeal baths. “These products are all safe for babies and can be effective in treating diaper rash and chafing,” he concluded.

Doctors urge parents to prioritise children’s gut health to prevent digestive problems,"Paediatricians have urged parents to prioritise children’s gut health to check the prevalence of common digestive problems among the young.
The commonly observed problems of the gut in children are constipation, hyperacidity and diarrhoea, doctors said.
Constipation affects up to 30 per cent of children. This is the most common cause of stomach pain in children and is often overlooked, said Dr Arun Wadhwa, visiting consultant, Paediatrics, Rainbow Children Hospital, New Delhi.Advertisement
Hyperacidity affects 22-25 per cent of infants in India, while diarrhoea kills an estimated 3,00,000 under-five children in the country each year, he said.
Elaborating on the importance of digestive health in children, Wadhwa said, “Diarrhoea is a very common problem in the early years and it is not necessarily related to teething. You should immediately start WHO’s ORS, probiotics and Zinc if not given in the last three months. It may take five to seven days to settle and do not be in a rush to start antibiotics – unless there is blood in stools.” It is also important that children are properly vaccinated with rotavirus and measles vaccines, he said.
This greatly helps in preventing diarrhoea. On observing any symptoms of digestive problems or for information related to vaccination, immediate consultation with a paediatrician is required, he asserted. “Hyperacidity and reflux in infants below nine months of age are also common problems. Most of them will settle with age and proper diet, though, rarely we may need a course of appropriate antacid medication,” he said.
Trillions of bacteria live inside our gut. For those who think bacteria is only of the bad kind, think again! In our gut thrives an ecosystem of bacteria that is very important for our health, especially for our developing children.Advertisement
Elaborating on how to take care of gut health in children, Dr M S Ajit, paediatrician, Modern Hospital Kodungallur, Kerala, said, “Mothers are always happy if the gut of their children is normal. And if the gut of the children is healthy, they can eat good food and maintain a level of nutrition. Gut health is most important for all of us to stay healthy.
The gut is the second brain. Common gut problems in children are loose motion, pain in abdomen, constipation and nausea. The healthy gut of children gives mothers the reason to smile.”
Uncomfortable digestion, stomach aches, poor nutrient absorption, poor immunity and sleep, mood fluctuations and general fatigue and tiredness are commonly observed symptoms of a poorly functioning gut. All these can have a detrimental impact on the overall well-being of any individual, especially children, Ajit stated.
There are many ways to boost children’s gut health such as breastfeeding, including more fibre in their diet, cutting down on fatty foods and opting for probiotics, he said.Advertisement

“Giving children small and frequent meals, ensuring adequate water intake and encouraging them to go out and play, and providing safe outdoor exposure, are very useful for their gut health. Avoiding unnecessary use of antibiotics is very important as these cause serious problems to their gut,” Ajit added.

"Pandemic babies’ developmental milestones: Not as bad as we feared, but not as good as beforePremium Story","The COVID-19 pandemic created conditions that threatened children‘s healthy development. Scientists and physicians raised concerns early in the pandemic, pointing out that increased parental stress, COVID infections, reduced interactions with other babies and adults and changes to health care could affect child development. Furthermore, some children could be especially vulnerable to the pandemic circumstances. With these concerns in mind, we started a longitudinal study of pregnant Canadians to understand how pandemic stressors might influence later child development.
Our initial findings were alarming: the rates of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals were two to four times higher during the early phase of the pandemic compared to numerous pregnancy studies prior to the pandemic. This worrisome increase in mental health problems was seen worldwide.
Impact on children’s development
To determine how the pandemic might be affecting children’s development, we measured developmental milestones in 3,742 12-month-old infants born during the first 18 months of the pandemic. We then compared these infants to a similar group of 2,898 Canadian infants born between 2015 and 2018.Advertisement
The study evaluated developmental milestones using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire-3. The ASQ-3 is a parent report of child behaviour that can help identify children at risk of developmental delays in five separate domains: Communication, Gross Motor, Fine Motor, Personal-Social and Problem Solving.
In a study to be published in the Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, we found that most children born during the pandemic were doing fine, with almost 90 per cent meeting their key developmental milestones in each area. This should be reassuring for parents, caregivers and communities, because it suggests that most children are developing normally despite adverse early circumstances.
However, a slightly higher proportion of children born during the pandemic were at risk of developmental delay in Communication, Gross Motor and Personal-Social domains, compared to children born before the pandemic. Our findings are consistent with prior smaller studies showing only small increases in the risk for poor verbal, motor and cognitive performance among 12-month-old infants born during the pandemic.
The largest effects we observed were in the Communication and Personal-Social domains. Infants born during the pandemic were almost twice as likely to score below cutoffs compared to pre-pandemic infants.
This represents an increase of about one to two additional children in 100 who are at risk, but highlights some potentially concerning effects of the pandemic on early child development. Across Canada, this could result in service demands for 20,000-40,000 additional preschool children.Advertisement
Although small in absolute terms, these increases have important implications, since already limited resources will need to increase to meet the needs of more children. Certainly, it will be important to continue monitoring infants/children born during the pandemic to determine how long-lasting these effects are.
Reassuringly, early interventions can be highly effective for children who are struggling.

Concerns about child development
Parents should be mostly reassured by these findings. Despite the disruptions to nearly every aspect of life during the pandemic, the majority of children continue to show healthy development. Parents with concerns about their child’s development may find these suggestions helpful: Provide your child with many opportunities for one-on-one interaction with a caring and responsive adult. The Harvard Center on the Developing Child describes the back-and-forth interactions that form the key processes of child development as “serve and return.” Believe in “ordinary magic.” This is the phrase that child development expert Ann Masten uses to describe how resilience emerges from ordinary, everyday processes and interactions. Children develop resilience when they have access to the right environments, the right relationships and the right chances to be able to safely explore themselves and the world around them.

Talk and sing with your child. Engaging an infant in conversation or song (even a pre-verbal infant) is a powerful way to encourage language learning.
There is a wide range of development that is considered “normal.” It is okay for your child to be at a different stage than other children their age, as long as your child is still showing signs of development. If you are concerned about your child’s development after some time of monitoring, discuss your concerns with a qualified health professional to determine if further investigation is needed. Overall, the findings of our study (and others) suggest that the effects of the pandemic on infant development (at least to one year of age) have not been as bad as we feared. However, a greater number of children will likely require further evaluation and support compared to pre-pandemic.Advertisement

Make sure your baby is sleeping in the right position with these simple tipsPremium Story,"Newborn babies are always a challenge. For most new parents, their only solace is putting their babies to sleep for some hours of respite. However, even though it might seem like that’s where parents can relax and let their guard down – it’s not.
Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in babies has haunted many parents across the world. Though the phenomenon is less common in Asian families or countries, it is always better to be safe than sorry. SIDS is a relative mystery in the medical sciences – very little is known about what causes it and how to prevent it. 
Despite this, there have been certain parenting habits which have been termed as better than others in terms of this rare phenomenon. Monitoring and correcting sleeping habits of the infant is one of the most important ones. Advertisement
In a reel shared on Instagram, Dr Santosh Yadav talks about the various sleeping positions infants have, and how they may or may not be related to sudden infant death syndrome. Dr Yadav answers the question “How should I put my baby to sleep?” with several illustrated examples of do’s and don’ts.

A post shared by Dr.Santosh Yadav | (MD,FIAP,DASII) (@parentingtips_surat)


The position he recommends as best is putting your baby on their back with a pillow for head support. The other positions he recommends are putting your infant on either side. Additionally, Dr Yadav strongly advises against is putting your baby on their stomachs. He says that this is not advisable until babies reach six months of age. Dr Yadav explains that, until six months, babies don’t get any support or control in their necks. Therefore, putting them on their stomachs for sleep can suffocate them and cause sudden infant death syndrome.

Dr Kanchan S Channawar, Senior Pediatrician & Pediatric Intensivist at Kamineni Hospitals, Hyderabad, however, advised against letting babies sleep sideways. She said, “This position is not as dangerous as stomach sleeping, but it still increases the risk of SIDS. Sleeping with the head turned to one side can cause the baby to develop a flat spot on the head.”
She further advised against allowing your baby to sleep with objects in the crib as it might lead to suffocation. “The best sleeping position for babies is on their backs, on a firm mattress, in a crib that is free of any objects.”
Dr. Channawar has some advice so you can make sure your baby does not turn on the stomach while sleeping. She said, “There are a few things that parents can do to prevent babies from turning on their stomachs in their sleep. These include placing the baby in the crib on their back. Making sure the crib is free of any objects that the baby could use to turn over such as blankets, pillows or stuffed animals, swaddling the baby loosely and placing the baby’s head at the foot of the crib.”Advertisement
In the reel, Dr. Yadav further said that newborn babies sleep up to 16 to 18 hours. If newborn babies sleep in that position for that long, “They will be flat due to pressure.” Therefore, he suggested putting them sideways for some time. 
Another position the doctor talks about is the “arching position”. “Some babies sleep in the arching position. It is normal if the baby’s weight is gaining, baby’s activity is good, and baby doesn’t milk a lot,” he concluded.

New research indicates possible cause for sudden infant death syndromePremium Story,"For new parents, their baby’s safety is of utmost importance. First priority and sometimes the only obsession for years, new parents are always on the lookout for their infant’s security. However, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDs) has been a constant source of despair among parents. With very little known about the phenomenon, a new study has attempted to explain it a bit further. 
The study published on May 25 in the Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology, attributes a specific chemical receptor in the brain as a contributory factor to SIDS. The chemical receptor, Serotonin 2A/C, is allegedly partly responsible for causing infants to suddenly die in their sleep. 
According to the study, infants use this receptor to respond to oxygen deprivation. The Serotonin 2A/C receptor helps infants wake up and gasp for air in these situations. However, abnormalities in the receptor hinders this process, and infants undergo sudden deaths in their sleep from lack of oxygen. Researchers of the study reached this conclusion after autopsying brain cells of babies who had died of SIDs and observing them against babies who had died of other causes. Advertisement
Moreover, another study explains that a fault or an abnormality in the Serotonin 2A/C receptors can be genetic and hereditary. It was revealed in the study that siblings of infants who had died of SIDS had a fourfold higher potential to undergo death by the same cause as compared to average.
Dr Kanchan S Channawar, Senior Pediatrician & Pediatric Intensivist at Kamineni Hospitals, Hyderabad, however, said that it is challenging and difficult to detect such predisposition in infants beforehand. “Although certain genetic variations are potential risk factors, there is no definitive genetic test. Genetic counseling and discussing the family’s medical history can offer some insights,” she added.
 Since death is caused during sleep, many believe that sleeping patterns and sleeping environments of the infants can be leading causes. (Source: Freepik)
A report by the Boston Children’s Hospital on SIDS states that it occurs in children below one year of age. However, it further says that despite investigation into the death and clinical history of the infants who died of it, SIDS cannot yet completely be explained. It also talks about how SIDS is the leading cause of post-neonatal babies in the US, but studies have shown that in India, it is an unlikely cause of infant mortality.

Since death is caused during sleep, many believe that sleeping patterns and sleeping environments of the infants can be leading causes. Also known as crib deaths, this occurrence was also related to parenting practices by a study published in the British Medical Journal. The study notes that Western babies are more likely to suffer SIDS than Asian babies as the former are more frequently left alone than the latter, especially while sleeping. The research observed that touch, noise, and rocking help babies stabilise their breathing. Since these factors are associated with people near the infants, babies who sleep alone are deprived of these external sensory stimulations. Advertisement
Dr Channawar said that SIDS is a complex ailment but there can be several preventative measures that can taken. “These include practicing safe sleep practices by placing infants on their back to sleep in a crib or bassinet with a firm mattress and without soft bedding, pillows or stuffed animals. Creating an appropriate sleep environment, maintaining a comfortable temperature and ensuring a smoke-free area are important. Breastfeeding, regular prenatal care, following the recommended immunization schedule and using pacifiers during sleep have also been associated with a decreased risk of SIDS.”

Try these simple tips to teach your kids to keep the kitchen cleanPremium Story,"Cooking and cleaning, thereafter, can be a headache. While some may enjoy cooking, others find solace in cleaning. However, there are very few who enjoy both, one after the other. How can it possibly be made more tiresome, you might think. But it can – by throwing kids in the mix. Kids are generally messy but add a kitchen to the mix; a spell for disaster. Whether you are cooking with your kids around, or teaching them how to cook, it might not end well for your kitchen. But as all problems have a solution, as does this.
Through Instagram, Heather, a cookbook author, shared a post which details a series of know-hows on how to teach kids to keep the kitchen clean. These much-needed tips can also be useful for your own cooking habits.

A post shared by 👩‍🍳Heather: Recipes + Cooking for Kids (@heather.happykidskitchen)


The first step is making a “kitchen contract”. Heather’s advice is setting down kitchen rules for yourself and your children. She further recommends making them as specific as possible which includes a kitchen cleanup checklist. Setting clear expectations of keeping the kitchen clean is important as it does not leave other options. Finally, writing down these rules can help establish them better than simply verbally declaring them.
In the second step, Heather advocates for the much known but much ignored cooking tip – clean as you do. “It’s so much easier to clean a little at a time instead of facing a mountain of dishes at the end,” she writes in her post. You know you have heard this before, multiple times maybe. If you have, you have for a reason. There are many intermittent gaps between cooking which you or your children might spend doing something else – maybe relaxing, maybe talking, maybe going to the next step. However, it is a good idea to use that time to clean up for the previous steps instead. That way, you won’t be left with the whole cleaning altogether, but would have completed it in phases. By the end of it, neither you, nor your kids might even realise there’s no pending cleaning left!Advertisement

The final step is making the process fun. From dancing to music with your kids to playing fun competitions on who cleans most or quickest, the opportunities are endless. Making it fun won’t just help your kids not crib about cleaning but will also give you an incentive to do it. 
Some simple rules might make all the difference. Try these tips and trick with your children and see the change it brings!

"Babies crawl, scoot and shuffle when learning to move. Here’s what to watch for if you’re worriedPremium Story","Early gross motor (or whole body) movements such as crawling and walking are exciting developments and clear markers for parents watching their child’s development. But what happens when a milestone isn’t reached, or the movement itself isn’t what a parent is expecting? Babies arrive in the world with inborn movements, including reflexes. Other motor skills – such as sitting up or rolling towards a toy on a playmat – are learned as they grow.
Most babies begin moving towards people or objects much further away from them in the second half of their first year. This marks a change for parents and carers too, because they can no longer walk away for a moment and come back to find baby in the same spot. Time to think about child proofing your living spaces if you haven’t already! But how can a parent or carer decide when to worry, when to get professional advice, or when to accept things are moving along just fine? Commonly babies will crawl “on all fours” with bellies above the floor and hands and knees moving forward in a diagonal pattern, where right arm and left leg move together and left arm and right leg move together. This stage can last weeks or months before infants rise up to cruise on their feet while holding on to the furniture. Cruising and walking is usually observed between eight and 18 months of age.
Some children, however, move differently, and some seem to skip the crawling stage altogether. Just as there is no specific day in the first year that all babies move off their play mat to explore, there is no one way of moving across the room.Advertisement
Some babies bottom-shuffle along while keeping their hands off the floor. Others commando crawl on their tummy, like soldiers staying low.
Some babies move hands first with their bent knees to follow like they are playing game of leapfrog. Many use combinations of any or all of the above in addition to crawling before they turn one.
Researchers and child development professionals used to think when traditional movement sequences were not observed, there was a definite problem with the way a child’s brain or body was developing.
While there are some schools of thought that suggest crawling is a critical part of child development, newer theories place more emphasis on the quality and variety of movements individual babies use to move. Some research has suggested variable crawling patterns can occur in children with, and without, later developmental delay. Earlier research found while 90 per cent of children achieved motor milestones by age two following a common sequence, 4.3 per cent did not show hands-and-knees crawling at all.Advertisement
Differences are not always cause for concern, but tuning in to your child’s movement pattern may be important if you are noticing something unexpected at this stage. Unusual, absent or delayed crawling patterns have been associated with cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, autism, developmental coordination disorder and other neurological, learning or developmental disorders.
Children with known neurological or physical issues, or adverse events before or at birth may also experience gross motor difficulties and delays.
For each of these groups, early assessment and intervention are important, as they carry greater potential benefit for children and families, compared with waiting until later to address concerns.
So, what are the signs that help parents know it is time to seek professional advice? By about 9–11 months there should be some regular attempts from babies to move in and out of still positions and explore the room around them. It is common for babies at this stage to use their arms and legs effectively together to direct themselves forward.Advertisement
When the left of the body is doing something quite different from the right (or vice versa) it is a sign further assessment may be needed.
When babies seem to be struggling with movement strength or range, particularly in the neck, arms, hands, or legs, this should be explored further by a health professional. Babies showing regular and ongoing signs of discomfort with their movements (such as grimacing or crying) should also be reviewed.
If parents or carers notice these things, it is important they raise it with a care provider, such as a maternal child and family health nurse or general practitioner. An appointment with one of these providers is usually the first stepparents take when there are concerns or they want extra observation or screening.
Some families may already have access to a paediatric occupational therapist, physiotherapist or paediatrician. Each can complete further assessments and offer advice as needed.Advertisement

In the vast majority of cases, parents have a good sense of when to worry. If you are concerned, seek out a healthcare professional who can help answer questions and provide advice. Neither you, nor your baby need to move through this stage alone.

Victimhood cannot be our identityPremium Story,"Dear You, 
At the outset, I have to admit it has been difficult for me to write this column as I wanted to reflect on a complex and sensitive topic without obscuring the injustices young women have to go through. But there has been such a tectonic shift in the landscape of mental health, that I believe staying silent would be wrong, too. 
So let me start with a story. Sona, a 13-year girl, had recently started refusing to go to school after being bullied by her peers who jeered her about her body, ganging up against her and calling her a “loser”. This along with hormonal spikes, pubertal body changes, academic stresses put so much pressure on her that she responded by withdrawing. She told me, “It is as if I am living in a perpetual war zone with no respite.”Advertisement
 At her lowest, she turned to the mental health industry on Instagram for some relief and was insidiously fed a steady dose of the language of misery and victimhood until she concluded that she was a “failure”. As she kept going into the darker underbelly of Instagram, she met people her age, across the world, who were experiencing similar distress and a strange camaraderie was built. Camaraderie is all well and good except when it becomes a dangerous echo chamber. Unwittingly, she was being indoctrinated into a world where victimhood became the passport for acceptance and the 3Ts the currency for belonging. 
Now, you might be curious about what I mean by 3Ts. Have you noticed how so much social media conversation is full of what trauma we have been through, what triggers us and how toxic everything is? I like to call it the tyranny of the 3Ts! I used the word “currency” of 3Ts because it certainly comes at a very heavy cost — the mental-health struggles in girls that have skyrocketed, propelled by the pandemic. We are searching for diagnoses as a way to find some solace for our pain and they are being dispensed at an alarming rate – borderline personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorder, etc. It is alarming as the pathologisation of human suffering fuels victimisation and alienates us from each other. 
I want to emphasise that my intention is not to dismiss the gender injustices girls have to go through in our patriarchal society. We grow up in a culture that judges us at every step and where we are expected to measure up to society’s standards of beauty, worthiness and success. We have to question our lives being reduced to stories of oppression without acknowledgement of stories of resistance and survival. Where we are convinced into believing that we are fragile victims and passive recipients of an unsafe world. Or even worse, persuaded to believe that feminism is about being in a constant state of outrage. It is a dangerous narrative as it disenfranchises us and diminishes our identity; deprives us of our sense of agency and strips us of our belief in responding to life’s hardships. 
So what steps can we take to reclaim our lives? Advertisement
Critiquing the dominant victimhood discourse: Sona started questioning the idea of  “loser” – who decides it, what impact this idea had on her and how harmful it was for her and other young people. We also unpacked the idea of her being a victim of trauma and though there was no doubt that bullying had been traumatic, she could make a shift and not let herself be defined by it. 
Conviction in our robustness: We had a conversation on how in the smallest ways she was resisting these oppressive ideas – maybe the way she was standing up to bullies, or protecting others in her class even on the toughest days. We got to know what it took to stand up to bullies, how justice and fairness were important to her and how she had been described as being “fearless,” and “gutsy,” from the time she was little, by her parents. 
Building kinships: Victimhood pushed Sona to find fault in her parents and rage at them for being “triggering,” “toxic”, and “not understanding”. Sona reflected, “I am so polite to the rest of the world but I was extremely harsh to my parents. Nobody is perfect and they were trying to do the best they could. They have stood by me through my worst times”. It was so wonderful for me to be a witness to an open and honest conversation with Sona and her family on what they appreciated about each other, how they might have hurt each other and what steps each one was ready to take to reconcile relationships. At times, restoring peace within families is not possible, and it is only by moving away that we have a chance of finding peace. In those circumstances, healing is about finding our own chosen families and tribe. 
Preferred identity: Most of all we talked about how Sona prefers to be seen – not as a passive victim but as a person who stands up for herself and her friends and who holds on to her dignity in the darkest moments. In the coming months, her parents stood by her as she made formal complaints of bullying in the school. As her father put it, “Our daughter is a warrior and we refuse to let her be treated unfairly.” But when no steps were taken, they decided to move to another school where she found healing and comfort in strong friendships. In Sona’s words, “It is not what happens to us that defines us but what steps we take to not let it define us.” Advertisement

We come from a long history of warrior women determinedly resisting hardships and standing up for justice – Rani Lakshmibai, Savitribai Phule, Sarojini Naidu and women who have led recent social movements — Justice for Nirbhaya, Narmada Bachao Andolan, Shaheen Bagh protest, Chipko movement, Irom Sharmila and Mothers of Manipur against the AFSPA, the global #MeToo movement, and of course, the recent women wrestlers’ unwavering protests. They have all shaken the cobwebs of our male-dominated society not by claiming victimhood but by standing up to it and politicising what had been personalised. 
There is a Mexican proverb, “They tried to bury me, but didn’t know that I’m a seed.” It captures the dignity of the human spirit. We warrior women are not mere victims of extreme hardships, pain or violations. We cannot be crushed, we resist, and we grow back again. Even stronger.

Jamie Oliver’s new ‘dish’: A book for children,"Famed chef and restaurateur Jamie Oliver used to tell his children bedtime stories and record them on a dictaphone so that he knew where he left off the night before.
Now several years later, these tales have taken the shape of a book – his first for kids.
In “Billy and the Giant Adventure”, Oliver seeks to deliver the perfect recipe for children – one pinch of adventure, a dash of friendship, a sprinkle of mystery and a huge spoonful of magic.Advertisement
The book, which has illustrations by Spanish artist Monica Armino, also features delicious recipes such as porridge, tropical fruit plate finished with mint sugar and spaghetti Bolognese.
When they were younger, two of Oliver’s children Petal and Buddy would ask him to tell them a bedtime story. To make sure he knew where he left off the night before, he would record the stories on a dictaphone and these became the contents of “Billy and the Giant Adventure”.
From the bedtime stories, it took him four years to complete the book, published by Penguin imprint Puffin.
His website mentions that Oliver created the book for those with dyslexia in mind.Advertisement
Being dyslexic himself, he knows how difficult it can be to read books, so he, alongside his publisher, carefully chose the font to make sure the text was as clear as possible, and that the illustrations were beautiful and eye-catching to keep children’s attention.
Then, to help those who love stories but find reading difficult, he created an audiobook that’s as fun, silly and engaging as possible.
“Jamie finds the physical act of putting pen to paper tricky, so he approached the book in a slightly different way – recording his stories on a dictaphone and working with editors to write them up. He was engaged in every step of the process, and even though it has been challenging because of his dyslexia, it has also encouraged Jamie to find ways around barriers and think really creatively,” the website says.
Billy, a gadget-obsessed 10-year-old boy whose big heart and thirst for excitement see him go on all sorts of adventures, and his friends Anna, Jimmy and Andy know that Waterfall Woods is out of bounds; strange things are rumoured to have happened there and no one in their village has ventured past its walls for decades.Advertisement

Kim Kardashian opens up about her parenting challenges: ‘The best chaos’Premium Story,"She might be a billionaire and a celebrity icon, but Kim Kardashian’s struggle with motherhood has been as typical as any other mother, she revealed on Monday. From doing hair to putting on shoes and solving tantrums, the SKIMS founder tackles parenting challenges with the obvious bittersweetness.
Jay Shetty’s and Kardashian’s conversation on parenting for Shetty’s podcast, On Purpose with Jay Shetty, talks about Kardashian’s struggles and stories of parenting. The reality star who is a mother to four – North, 9, Saint, 7, Chicago, 5, and Psalm, 4, spoke about her experience as a mother and how parenting has helped her discover herself better than anything else. 

While Kardashian shares custody of the children with ex-husband Kanye West, who quit the marriage after almost seven years, she said that there is no one else in the house to “play good police officer and bad cop,” except her.Advertisement
When Shetty asked her to compare the ideas of parenting, she had before and after she became a parent, Kardashian said, “Everyone says the days are long and the years are short, and that couldn’t be like a truer statement.”
The celebrity mogul, who had her first child 10 years ago, said that since then, her house has turned into madness. “So, like, when you’re in it, I mean, especially when they’re babies and you’re feeding…there’s madness going on. It’s like full madness,” she continues. However, the reality TV star did call it “the best chaos” of her life. 
One of Kardashian’s biggest struggles as a mother she said is trying to give her kids a sense of normalcy, away from the paparazzi and the celebrity drama. A place where she finds that normalcy more than others is in Japan. “Everyone’s really respectful — even if they might recognize you, they don’t ask for photos…It’s a really amazing experience. … A little glimpse of that especially for the little ones is so good.”

In addition, Kardashian said that all her children want is time with her. Balancing work (which she finds solace in) and allotting quality time with her kids is another major struggle of motherhood for working mothers like her. She said, “Working for me, I love working, so that makes me happy. Anytime I think something’s really hard, I dive into work…I think how to balance work with that is when you’re home being really present. Kids, all they want is time. They just want your time.”Advertisement
Finally, as most moms would agree, Kardashian too feels figuring it all out so it balances is the crux of motherhood; and no mom can ever be prepared for it. “You are never prepared…But you will figure it out, and it will make you so proud of yourself that you figured it out and that you got through the day.”

"Exhausted, disconnected and fed up – what is ‘parental burnout’ and what can you do about it?Premium Story","For many parents, the reality of juggling the demands of caring responsibilities on their time, energy and resources leaves them with little time to take care of their own wellbeing. This can result in “parental burnout”.
Although the exploration of parental burnout is relatively new, research has identified it as a prevalent issue across global communities and cultures. It’s reported in countries around the world, with the highest prevalence rates rising to 8 per cent of parents in Poland, the United States and Belgium.
You could be forgiven for thinking there’s a simple solution to this growing concern: relax and get some sleep! But again, the reality can be far different.
4 signs of parental burnoutAdvertisement
Parental burnout is not just a buzzword. It’s a growing syndrome that results from chronic parenting stress. It is characterised by four main symptoms for parents: experiencing physical or emotional exhaustion – or both feeling shame about their parenting, or that they’re not as good a parent as they used to be feeling overwhelmed or “fed up” with the role of being a parent feeling emotionally disconnected from their children.
Despite many feeling this way, recent research shows 60 per cent of parents don’t routinely do anything to relax and recharge.
This research reports two in five parents feel tiredness impacts their ability to be the kind of parent they want to be, and nearly half of all parents think there’s not enough time in the day to get everything done.
And that’s the conundrum. It can be hugely challenging for caregivers to carve out time and space to look after themselves.Advertisement
But when they do, it can have a positive impact on their physical and mental health, which can help them to manage the demands of parenting, so children and families benefit too.
4 positive things parents can do

So, what can parents and carers do to help prevent or reduce burnout when they’re already stretched so thin? Here are four things to explore:
1. Being less critical of yourself
As parents, we can all have days when we don’t feel like we’re doing our best. We may feel disconnected from our children, or emotionally and physically drained. This is where “self-compassion” comes in – being a little kinder to ourselves when we feel stressed or experience setbacks.
Not only is this good for parents and carers, but it can also be a key life skill they can model for their children.
Even though it can be overlooked, or its importance downplayed, self-compassion is a crucial form of self-care.Advertisement
Moreover, research has shown parents who are kind to themselves and prioritise self-care have better overall health and well-being. They also feel more confident in their parenting skills and have more positive interactions with their children.
And parent’s well-being, confidence and positive interactions with their children are strongly linked to better outcomes for children, including those with mental health challenges or disability.
Even if you make mistakes or your inner critic starts chiming in, try to reframe its voice into a more positive one. Remember, everyone faces challenges and there is no such thing as a perfect parent or child. Adopting this mindset can help.
2. Reframing self-care
As a parent or carer, it’s common to put your own needs last and see self-care as an optional extra – something that takes precious time away from the responsibilities of parenting, or simply so low on the long list of priorities that it slips off.Advertisement
However, taking care of yourself is the opposite of being selfish. Parents who prioritise self-care tend to be less self-critical and have better physical and mental health.
They also feel more skilled and confident as parents, are able to focus on parenting tasks better – even during stressful times – and are more likely to enjoy parenting.
It can be helpful to remember self-care isn’t just a “nice to have” option. And it’s not selfish to put your needs back into the picture – rather, it’s an important parenting skill that benefits everyone.
3. Remembering small, everyday moments of self-care have a big impact Advertisement
The concept of self-care is often portrayed as a special treat or occasional, expensive indulgence.
However, it can be more about those small, every day, under-the-radar actions that might only take a few minutes, or even seconds, but can set up positive patterns that can help parents to feel more balanced.
Something as simple as pausing to take some slow, deep breaths, going for a short walk in the fresh air or chatting with a supportive friend can help.
Even minor actions can add up over time to help parents navigate ups and downs more positively.
4. Asking for help
Parental burnout is one part of a larger conversation around the realities of being a parent or carer. There are often multiple factors at play that can contribute to burn out, such as lack of support, high levels of responsibility, the impact of natural disasters, looking after ageing parents and financial concerns.Advertisement
It’s important for parents and carers to be mindful of the signs of burnout, and to seek help where needed.
By addressing this issue as one important part of the broader parenting and care-giving journey, we can work towards creating more resilient, positive family environments for parents and children alike.
It is important to acknowledge that it is usually women who shoulder more of the caring load. Partners, employers and extended family should be on the look out for signs of burnout and offer help before they are asked.
Offering flexible work arrangements may be helpful, especially for those (for example, single parents) who may be doing it tough.

If parental burn out is affecting your day-to-day life, seek help through Lifeline, Parentline, your GP or an allied health professional. The Australian government has also made an evidence-based parenting support programme available for free.Advertisement

Unexpected results? How to manage the disappointmentPremium Story,"In these months, a lot of young adults are feeling the stress of impending exam results, coupled with the worry and anxiety of taking major decisions. The pressure of board exams, joint entrances, college interviews, etc. does this to the best of the best. A lot seems to be riding on these results – college admission, making parents proud, a good career, and the idea of making new friends. For parents, it is the stress of what children will make of themselves in the future.
Every child and parent has been through the fear of an unknown future. 
This tension can lead to raging tempers and arguments which create a distance between loved ones. The most important thing to focus on is to think with a calm mind and look after the well-being of your entire family, including yourself. I personally believe that even the unhappiest of outcomes, can’t hold you back when you have drive, determination and self-belief. 
Some ways to manage this: Advertisement
*Strengthen Mindset: When we don’t get what we have desperately worked towards, things can turn upside down. Everything you thought of as part of a plan seems to disappear just like that. However, whatever results you achieve, it is not the end of the road. Some of the greatest people in the world faced setbacks and failures. Walt Disney was rejected by 300 investors for his creation of Mickey Mouse; Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, had innumerable failures; Steven Spielberg was rejected from film school three times; JK Rowling’s Harry Potter faced rejection by 12 publishing houses. Stay inspired to strengthen your mindset. Keep working on alternative options, there are different routes you can take if things don’t go as planned.
*Black or White: It’s not unusual to imagine that you are in the worst possible situation and everything bad happens only to you. “I never get what I work for”; “Nothing ever goes right in our family”; “It’s all downhill from here.” This is called a ‘black-and-white’ thinking pattern. This can make you feel hopeless as it blocks you from seeing any middle options. You need to remind yourself that life is a long journey and irrespective of the marks or admission you are hoping for, you can build a meaningful life for yourself.
*Restart your hobbies & co-curricular activities: Going back to these always brings out happiness and joy. Now you have the time to do all those activities that one had to stop before the board exams. Whether it is playing a sport, singing, learning an instrument or art. Dedicate time specially to do that. 
*Personal growth: You are at a crucial stage where you can learn something new or explore a new area of interest. With the internet, learning is now at your fingertips. There are free and paid programmes on websites such as Coursera, Udemy, and YouTube.   Advertisement

As parents, be vigilant to any change. If you notice your child is not looking or behaving like their usual selves, talk to them. Let them know you’re there for them unconditionally. Sit down with them and listen to understand them. If your child talks of giving up on life, please reach out to a mental health professional immediately.

Here’s how flu can be dangerous for childrenPremium Story,"Flu is a common term used for acute viral illnesses that affect people of all ages. It is caused by different types of viruses, and the symptoms may vary based on the severity of the infection. Flu is one of the most common infections that we get, and it usually spreads through droplets when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. The flu can be particularly dangerous for children, elderly people, and individuals with weakened immune systems.

Causes of Flu in Children:
The flu is caused by different types of viruses, including influenza A, B, and C viruses. These viruses are highly contagious and can spread rapidly through droplets or direct contact with infected individuals. The flu season usually starts in the fall and peaks in the winter months. However, the timing and severity of the flu season may vary based on several factors such as geographic location, climate, and vaccination rates.
Symptoms of Flu in Children:
The symptoms of flu in children may vary from mild to severe and can last for several days to weeks. The common symptoms of flu include fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, headache, fatigue, and chills. In severe cases, the flu can lead to complications such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and ear infections. Children may also experience vomiting and diarrhea, particularly in cases of influenza B and C.
Prevention of Flu in Children:
Preventing the flu in children is crucial to reduce the risk of complications and hospitalizations. Maintaining proper hygiene practices such as hand washing, covering mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing, and avoiding close contact with sick individuals can help prevent the spread of the flu. In addition, getting the annual flu vaccine can reduce the risk of getting infected with the virus. The flu vaccine is safe and effective and is recommended for all children aged six months and older. The vaccine is updated every year based on the circulating virus strains, and it is best to get it before the start of the flu season.
Treatment of Flu in Children:
The treatment of flu in children involves managing the symptoms and preventing complications. Over-the-counter medications can help reduce fever and relieve pain. However, aspirin should be avoided in children due to the risk of Reye’s syndrome. Rest, hydration, and a healthy diet can help boost the immune system and aid in recovery. In severe cases, antiviral medications may be prescribed to reduce the duration and severity of the illness.
When to be Worried:
Parents should be concerned if their child experiences recurrent infections leading to weight loss, delayed growth, and developmental milestones. Sudden drops in school performance, decreased physical activity, and social interaction are also warning signs. In such cases, it is essential to seek medical attention and rule out underlying health conditions that may be contributing to the recurrent infections.
Flu is a common infection that affects children, and it can lead to severe complications in vulnerable populations. The prevention and treatment of flu in children involve maintaining proper hygiene practices, getting the annual flu vaccine, and managing symptoms. Parents should seek medical attention if their child experiences recurrent infections or warning signs of underlying health conditions. With proper care and precautions, children can stay healthy and thrive despite the challenges posed by the flu season.

See what baby names were the most popular in the U.S. last year,"Dutton and Wrenlee are on the rise but they’re no match for champs Liam and Olivia as the top baby names in the U.S. last year.
The Social Security Administration released the annual list Friday. The agency tracks baby names in each state based on applications for Social Security cards, with names dating to 1880.
It’s Liam’s sixth straight year as No. 1. Olivia has reigned since the name unseated Emma four years ago. Emma is No. 2.Advertisement
Coming in third for girls’ names is Charlotte, followed by Amelia, Sophia, Isabella, Ava, Mia, Evelyn and Luna. For boys’ names, Liam is followed by Noah, Oliver, James, Elijah, William, Henry, Lucas, Benjamin and Theodore.
Luna is the only newcomer in the Top 10, booting Harper.
The agency has been compiling the list since 1997, often revealing the impact pop culture has on baby naming trends. The smash hit “Yellowstone” has clearly influenced new parents. The neo-Western starring Kevin Costner debuted in 2018, with characters surfacing among baby names ever since.
Dutton moved up the Social Security list to 835, a change of 986 spots from 2021. It’s the last name of the fictional family featured on the series, and it counts Costner’s John Dutton in its ranks. Dutton is the fastest rising name in the Social Security rankings.Advertisement
Another Dutton name follows actual Dutton as a star with a bullet among baby names. Kayce, as in Kayce John Dutton on the show, moved to the 587th most popular name, up from 1,077 the year before. Luke Grimes plays Kayce.
Rip, also from “Yellowstone,” has grabbed some naming attention, but it didn’t crack Social Security’s top 1,000. Cole Hauser’s Rip Wheeler is Dutton adjacent as the son-in-law of John.
Other names rising fast for boys: Chosen, Khaza, Eithan. For girls, Wrenlee is followed by Neriah, Arlet, Georgina and Amiri.

Curious Kids: What happens when you flush a toilet on a plane?Premium Story,"What happens when you flush a toilet on a plane? –Lily, aged 6, Harcourt Lily this is a great question! It doesn’t work like your toilet at home, which uses gravity to remove waste from our toilets into the sewer system. An aeroplane toilet uses a vacuum system along with a blue chemical that cleans and removes odours every time you flush.
A smelly tank
The waste and blue cleaning fluid ends up in a storage tank under the floor, in the very back of the cargo hold of the aeroplane. With so many people on the plane using the toilets, you can imagine how big the storage tank is! The system is designed very much like the vacuum cleaners we use around the house to remove dirt and dust from our floors. This dirt and dust ends up in a container that we empty into a garbage bin.
Similarly, the aeroplane’s toilets need the vacuum pressure system to move all the waste from the toilet into the plumbing pipe that connects the toilet to the storage tank, and finally into the tank.Advertisement
There is a valve on the storage tank that opens when a toilet is flushed and closes when the toilet is not in use – to prevent odours from leaving the tank. This helps to keep the smell down from so many people using the toilet during a flight. The blue chemical helps to keep the smell down as well.
Where does it go once the plane lands?
A special truck comes to the aircraft after it lands and connects a hose to remove the waste and blue cleaning chemical into a storage tank on the truck. The truck plugs a hose into the airplane’s waste tank valve and removes all of the waste into the tank on the back of the truck.
The truck then takes the waste to a special area at the airport reserved for the waste from all aeroplanes, and the toilet waste is emptied into the sewer system for that airport. The training to operate the truck takes three days.
Watch out for blue ice
It has also been reported that sometimes, particularly on older planes, the valve where the waste truck connects to the aeroplane can leak a small amount of the waste and blue chemical. This turns to ice as the temperature at normal cruising altitude of 30,000 feet is normally around -56 degree Celsius and the chemical turns to “blue ice”. This blue ice remains attached to the plane as long as the temperature remains below freezing.Advertisement

Once the aeroplane begins to descend to land at the destination airport, the blue ice begins to thaw and may even fall off. There have been several occasions reported in the news where people have witnessed this flying poo! In case you were wondering, the captain of the plane doesn’t have a button to release the waste from the storage tank while the plane is flying. Any waste that might leak out of the plane would be totally accidental.
Some people do think aeroplane contrails (the white lines planes sometimes leave in the sky) are either a special mind-control chemical or toilet waste. This is not true! What you are actually seeing are water vapours coming from the engine becoming ice crystals – like a thin cloud in the sky.

Book excerpt: How to teach your kid about money managementPremium Story,"According to the Reserve Bank of India, only 27% of Indian adults are financially literate. In fact, in the recent budget, the finance minister referred to the importance of implementing financial literacy as a subject at a younger age followed by the RBI celebrating Financial Literacy Week which is celebrated every year from 13 to 17 February.
And as parents, it is our duty to do the best for our children. Laying a solid foundation for understanding different aspects of money is therefore, imperative. In this chapter from Money Lessons, we will talk about the concept of modern economics that use modern money. 
Let’s talk about the modern world where we live, where people buy candies from the store and go to the movies on the weekend. Ever wondered how the money exchange happens during these transactions? Through paper notes and coins backed by the government. This form of money is called Fiat money, it is backed by the government and is used across all modern economies. And in today’s day and age, in addition to using paper money or physical currency, one also can also make digital payments. These include online transfers like UPI (Google Pay), Net banking, online wallets like Paytm, etc. Advertisement
But how does one earn this money? By either selling some goods or working for someone i.e., providing a service. The money you earn can be saved in bank accounts and can be later used to buy candies and movie tickets or pay bills and rent.
Money: A tool that solved it all
Most problems we faced with the previous ways of exchange or transaction were solved by Fiat Money. It came with its own set of benefits. Let’s read about them and see how the need for a better system of exchange took the evolution of money to where we are today.

 Medium of Exchange
The primary function of money is to act as a medium of exchange. Fiat money removed the limitation of ‘double coincidence of wants’ (a situation where both the seller and buyer agree to sell and buy each other’s goods) and made the exchange easier.
 Unit of Account
It is a standard numerical value attached to goods and services so that the transactions appear fair and justified.
 Store of Value
This function helps individuals conserve their wealth without fearing the loss of its value or durability. A typical example would be depositing money in the bank to buy goods and services later. Value of the money shall remain even after several years have passed.
 Standard of Deferred Payment
Money also allows you to purchase goods right now and pay for them later on. This is known as deferred payments. For example – taking loans from friends and family and paying them over time.

Take Time: Here’s what you need to know about learning disabilityPremium Story,"Education in the modern era is both lengthy and competitive. In this digital age, every individual chases his own fate. However, not all may be able to pick up pace and may lag in this education race. Education for some may thus turn out to be a very laborious and tedious process.
What is learning disability?
A child with specific learning disability is one of average or above average intelligence who has specific difficulties which can make learning very difficult. There may be deficits in any of the basic central nervous system functions, which have to do with the acquisition and use of listening, speaking, reading, writing, reasoning or mathematical abilities i.e. attention, memory, language, auditory and visual perception, motor coordination and planning, spatial orientation, impulse control and sequencing — in short, if there is a discrepancy between the child’s potential and actual achievement.
Dyslexia
Dyslexia is also known as a reading disorder; it is characterised by a trouble with reading. Different people are affected to varying degrees. Problems may include difficulties in spelling words, reading quickly, writing words, pronouncing words when reading aloud and understanding what one reads.
Dyscalculia
Advertisement
Dyscalculia is a difficulty in learning or comprehending arithmetic, such as difficulty in understanding numbers, learning how to manipulate numbers, and learning facts in mathematics. Children in school may find it difficult to comprehend sums, word problems, fractions and basic algebra.
Dysgraphia
Dysgraphia is a deficiency in the ability to write. It is a writing disorder associated with impaired handwriting. At school, a child’s handwriting may be illegal, untidy, and incomplete, may clutter a word at the end of a line, and may apply too much or too little pressure while writing.
Commonly made errors

Mirror images and reversal writing  
    
Dyspraxia
It is a brain-based condition that makes it hard to plan and coordinate physical movement. Children with dyspraxia tend to struggle with balance and posture. They may appear clumsy or out of sync with their environment. It can affect the development of gross motor skills like walking, running and jumping. It can also affect fine motor skills.
Aphasia
Aphasia is a communication disorder that results from damage or injury to language parts of the brain. Aphasia gets in the way of a person’s ability to use or understand words. Aphasia does not impair the person’s intelligence. People who have aphasia may have a difficulty in speaking and finding the “right” words to complete their thoughts. They may also have problems understanding conversation, reading and comprehending.
Strategies to help school goers-
               MATHAdvertisement

Use attractive material, however, do not bombard in too much colour.
Using different textures to teach numbers is a good option. Children learn well by the touch-and-feel method.
Allow the child to write numbers/letters  in a salt tray, avoid sand as some may consume it.
Use real objects to introduce number value and counting.
Follow the right learning sequence, first  3D objects followed by flash cards or 2D material.
For the concept of greater and less than, make sure that the two examples you show are diverse. E.g. 2 and 10 and not 7 and 8
While teaching new concepts like addition and subtraction, make sure there is a gap of a few days to avoid confusion.
While teaching fractions, allow the child to cut a cake into slices or tear a tissue into pieces or cut a fruit. Only drawing it the note book may not help.
While teaching word problems, make sure you have a clear list of mathematical operations, E.g.: sum, into and total, stand for addition.
If your child particularly has a difficulty in a subject or topic, mount a chart of it on a wall in your house.
Use the abacus or table board to teach math in an attractive manner.
If your child reverses a few numbers/letters make a list of them and practice them individually daily.

    READING

Start from small to big letters.
Teach the importance of the different punctuation marks while reading.
Teach sight words by sticking the word on the object itself. Eg: stick the word, table on a table, the word wall, on a wall.
If the child jumps between lines, place a ruler/scale or blank sheet of paper under each line that is being read.
Highlight words that he/she may find difficult to read or pronounce.
Encourage reading/memorising one word from the dictionary daily.
E-flash apps is a good free app to teach all basic concepts. It mentions a word, says how to pronounce it and displays a picture too.
Encourage reading the newspaper headlines.
Encourage reading by introducing picture stories

          WRITING

To introduce writing use a thicker crayon or piece of chalk.
Use colourful pencils and pens to make writing more fun.
Use a gripper to improve the writing grip.
Write on sand or salt using a stick or pointer finger.
Make a list of all the letters that are being reversed, omitted or substituted.
Use wipe-and-write sheets to encourage writing.
Join-the-dots, complete the maze and basic tracing activities always help.
Fine motor activities like beading, peg board games, building blocks and puzzles can help improve writing and perceptual skills.

Students may feel pressurised or unduly compared with their “better” sibling or classmate, this may lead to a lowered self-esteem and self-image, which may thus trigger an emotional problem in the near future. It is important to respect and appreciate the smallest efforts the child attempts to put in.

Parents: Prepare yourself for Board exam 2023 resultsPremium Story,"The intelligence of youngsters is gauged by the marks they get. It would be fair to say all parents wish their children to perform well academically. Board exams are one of the most stressful times in a family’s life – for the teenager and the parents. The tension and anxiety usually doesn’t end on the last day of the examination – it carries on till the results come out,
As a parent you may have lot of thoughts around the score, college admissions and what your hopes are from your child, which is understandable. Your mind constantly thinks: How will my son/daughter do? Where will they get in? Will my child get more marks than our neighbour’s child?
You can feel bogged down by the thought of receiving countless phone calls from your relatives and friends enquiring about the marks, which could bring in a lot of unwanted turmoil and comparisons.Advertisement
When the results are out, suddenly, it’s a family affair. It’s no longer only the youngster’s performance and capability. Marks are somehow associated with the parent’s upbringing, values, family’s success, and happy home environment. Young teenagers also feel the pressure of performing well. So much is riding on it. So many eyes and questions are directed at them when result day is around the corner. They go through their own share of post-exam anxiety and stress.
Here are some ways to manage the results day:
Nurture their Future: Avoid words and statements that could potentially damage their inner-worth and put a dark cloud of their future ahead. An example would be: “You are good for nothing”; “Nothing good will happen now”; “You will end up working as a cleaner”. An exam performance does not always define who they are and how they will do in the future. As parents you need to prepare and nurture their future, not predict if it will be bleak or bright. Create a road map to move ahead – strategise how to improve, put in the effort in the right direction, look at underlying reasons which are not getting desired results.
Comparison is the thief of joy: Comparison with any sibling, cousin or friend can often feel like a heavy load on their sensitive mind. You may remember from your days at school/college, how destabilising comparison is. Young people interpret comparison as a form of criticism, they start thinking that there are not as loved, they are a misfit in the family, they are failures in the eyes of parents. It tends to take a toll on their mental health, confidence and even yours as a parent! If someone else’s child is doing better academically, it’s okay. Keep your focus on what is your child does well – it could be behaviour, a talent, skills, etc.
Dealing with Expectations: If you are disappointed over their marks, let them know that. Naturally, as parents, you may get shocked and disappointed if the results are lower than expectations. It may even lead to an outburst or stern reaction. This usually stems from “log kya kahenge” or fear of what the future will entail. This could lead to further distancing and resentment in your parent-child bond. A healthy and emotionally supportive parent is better positioned to help their grown-up child. So do remind yourself, that the board exam results are not the only defining point of life, their future can still be bright.Advertisement

Reach Out and Listen: Be vigilant and observant to any changes in behaviour. If you notice your teen not looking and behaving like their normal selves, tell them, “You seem sad/withdrawn. Would you like to talk about it? Maybe I can help.” Let them know you’re there for them and love them unconditionally. Listen and try and see their point of view. More succinctly, create an environment where sharing is encouraged. Children often talk and share when not prompted constantly to do so.

‘Kidfluencer’ culture is harming kids in several ways – and there’s no meaningful regulation of itPremium Story,"Parents share content of their children for myriad reasons, including to connect with friends and family, and to seek validation or support.
However, some parents also do this for commercial gain. They manage their children as social media “kidfluencers” – allowing them to work with brands to market products to other children (and adults).
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s latest interim report for the Digital Platforms Services Inquiry has acknowledged key issues relevant to kidfluencers, including privacy concerns and possible labour exploitation issues.Advertisement
Our research, published recently in the M/C Journal, further highlights how the kidfluencer culture opens the door for possible child exploitation and a host of other problems.
There is a clear need for regulation in this space – and achieving it will require a considered, collective effort.
Is YouTube the world’s most popular babysitter? Speaking to Forbes in 2019, Eyal Baumel, the chief executive of Yoola (a management company which also manages digital child stars), described YouTube as “the most popular babysitter in the world”.
Since then, the COVID pandemic has prompted a surge in screentime for kids, who are being marketed toys as well as other products normally targeted to adults.
Product lines for kids are big business. In 2021, the global toys market was projected to grow from about US$141 billion to $230.6 billion by 2028.Advertisement
It’s now common to see YouTube kidfluencers marketing toys to other kids through toy “reviews”. But these videos aren’t the same as traditional product reviews. They’re mash-ups that blur the lines between three major genres: reviews, branded content and entertainment.
The most popular toy review channels have millions of subscribers, and their hosts are some of YouTube’s top earners. Ryan’s World is probably the most well-known channel in this genre. Conservative estimates suggest 10-year-old Ryan Kanji’s family earns about US$25 million each year.
Instakids are on the rise
Apart from YouTube (now more popular among kids than television), a significant number of kids and teens are also spending time on Instagram.
According to a 2021 report by child protection organisation Thorn, about 40% of children under age 13 (out of some 750 interviewed) said they’d used Instagram. This is despite the platform ostensibly only being for people aged 13 and older.Advertisement
For our latest research, we analysed the Instagram accounts of two Australian influencer siblings to better understand the nature of child-to-child marketing in 2023.
Pixie Curtis, age 11, started her online toy store Pixie’s Pix during COVID, when toy sales rose globally. This came after initial success selling hair bows through Pixie’s Bows, a business managed by her mother, PR entrepreneur and reality TV personality Roxy Jacenko.
Pixie’s Instagram account (which has about 136,000 followers), and her brother Hunter’s (20,000 followers), have been used to promote Pixie’s Pix toys as well as other brands and products.
And although Pixie recently “retired” from the toy shop business, she continues to promote products, including her original line of hair bows and other brands’ skincare and beauty products.Advertisement
Our research identifies key areas of concern, including: a lack of online privacy for kidfluencers, who have many aspects of their lives publicised online the commodification of children, and the enabling of a culture geared at up-selling them products and services the gendered marketing of toys and an increased focus on appearance for girls (which can be harmful for their self-esteem) the “stealth” marketing of toys and other products through advertorials.
Regulation is needed now
So far, the French government appears to be the only one that has taken tangible action to regulate the labour of child social media influencers. Under French law, children below age 16 can only work limited hours, and their earnings must be safeguarded in an account made accessible when they turn 16.
France is also considering legislation to regulate “sharenting” – a portmanteau of sharing and parenting that describes the practice of consistently posting content about one’s children on social media.
In the US, the Coogan Act (named after child star Jackie Coogan) was signed into law in 1939 to regulate child labour in the entertainment industry, but no equivalent laws have been enacted for child social media stars.Advertisement
Nonetheless, the problems surrounding kidfluencing are starting to gain attention around the world.
Last year a UK House of Commons report investigated the implications of influencers targeting children with advertorials, especially those that provide little to no disclosure of the post being an ad.
The committee made several recommendations, including promoting young people’s social media literacy, developing a code of conduct for influencer marketing, and strengthening the powers of the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority and Competition and Markets Authority.
As a result, the UK’s Department for Education is now “open to exploring legislative ways of improving employment protection for child influencers”.Advertisement
The unintended consequences of regulation In January, Meta (the parent company of Facebook and Instagram) held its first Summit on Youth Safety and Wellbeing. It might be trying to get on the front foot as regulators continue to scrutinise platforms on issues relevant to young people’s social media use.
But regulating in the kidfluencer space won’t be easy. In March, Utah introduced laws to stop children under 18 having access to social media without parents’ explicit consent – but critics have pointed out the potential negative consequences.
Teens use social media for important connections, including with friends and online support groups. Vulnerable teens may become isolated without online support from their peers. Beyond that, social media provide kids with a sense of enjoyment and identity. Taking this away could do more harm than good.

More work is needed to determine what effective regulation would look like. While parents and educators have a role to play to increase children’s social media literacy, digital platforms and businesses should also step up.Advertisement

"Illustrated books to give real-life account of Mario Miranda, Dadasaheb Phalke","Two illustrated books on the life and times of cartoonist Mario Miranda and father of Indian cinema Dadasaheb Phalke aim to introduce children to the Indian greats in their respective creative fields.
“Humour with Mario Miranda” and “Tenacity with Dadasaheb Phalke“, written by award-winning poet Pervin Saket and illustrated by Devika Oza and Neeti Banerji, respectively, is published under AdiDev Press’s ‘Learning To Be’ series.
“Pursuing art or music or film can be every bit as rewarding as more traditional jobs! We hope the example of Phalke and Miranda will help kids think differently about what they want to do when they grow up,” said Chitwan Mittal, founder and editorial director of AdiDev Press in a statement.Advertisement
While Miranda was known for his trademark stylish strokes — which told detailed colourful stories with shades of humour — Phalke, beside directing India’s first full-length feature film, “Raja Harishchandra” in 1913, made over 90 movies and 26 short films in his illustrious career of 19 years.
Today is also the 97th birth anniversary of the late cartoonist. He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1988, the Padma Bhushan in 2002 and was conferred the Padma Vibhushan posthumously in 2012.
“It was a delight to work on Mario Miranda’s story and translate his visual humour into verses for kids. His caricatures are as affectionate as they are biting — as a creative artist I know how difficult it is to achieve that balance.

Dadasaheb Phalke is inspiring not just for his vision but also his energy and uncompromising worth ethic! Journeying with him in the course of these books has been a privilege,” said Saket, author of the books.
Both the books are currently available for purchase across online and offline stores.Advertisement

Autism calls for advocacy not apologyPremium Story,"Roni has been in my room for just 10 minutes and already my room looks as if a tiny hurricane has swept through it. Books are out of the bookshelves, the toys strewn, colour pencils spilt all over the floor. His mother, Naina, is trying to hold on to his flailing limbs and simultaneously apologising to me repeatedly. After some combined effort, the little one does settle down with playdough. As we knead and pound some shapes together, I turn to her, “You don’t have to say sorry to me.”
Naina replies, ironically with an apology, “I am so sorry but it has become my habit now. I apologise to his teachers when they complain about him, to the shopkeepers, people in the restaurant, to my neighbours… everywhere.” “What is the apology for?” I wonder aloud. Naina, checking on her little boy who, by now, had nestled in her lap for a nap, says, “People think there is something wrong with him and blame me for not doing my job well. There is so much shame and guilt.”
I say to her, ruefully, “Shame and guilt could be the middle name for every mother I have met in my life including myself.”Advertisement
Naina tells me with tears in her eyes, “I can never get it right no matter how much I try. My in-laws think it is all my fault; my husband thinks I am too strict; teachers think I am not strict enough; therapists say I am too anxious. When I look at other mothers I worry I am not doing enough,”
This is an echo of a conversation that I have had with multiple mothers of neuro-divergent children, including myself. Where shame and guilt sit heavily on our shoulders dictating our worth, defining our enoughness, isolating us in silence. It robs us of our sense of agency as we start measuring ourselves, our children, and each other through the normative lens of society. Just visualise a child having a meltdown, screaming and where do the fingers point immediately? Yes, the mother.
Children with autism live in a world that fails them in so many ways. Blaming the mother becomes a quick and convenient way to shrug off our collective responsibility. April is celebrated as Autism Acceptance Month: let’s not forget that along with accepting children with autism we have to accept their mothers, too. There is no cookie-cutter approach to parenting. We are all doing the best we can with the skills and resources we have.
What gives me hope and always fills me with awe is the mothers with children with autism who refuse to let victimhood define their identity. As a mother and a therapist, their fiery spirit fascinates me a lot and therefore I did a short survey with them to find out what advice they would have for young mothers like Naina, who have just started this journey of “Advocacy, No apology”. Here are some of the responses:Advertisement
• Being an advocate means complete acceptance of our children, standing up for their rights, and being their voice till they are able to advocate for themselves so that they believe that they have a voice and a choice.
• Commit to seeing that sparkle in our children when others just see shadows. Learning to live life one day at a time, from one hour to another, moment to moment. Particularly on sludgy days when every step seems exhausting.
• Chhati taan ke chalna: (Walk with head held high and with dignity). Society rejects children who do not fit into the neat grooves designed for them. But we cannot let their judgement measure our children’s worth or even our worth.
• What sustains me is the sheer joy I get being with my son, his resilience to face a world that can be pretty hostile at times with an innocent smile. My son is my North Star and I am learning and unlearning so much from him every day.Advertisement
• Therapists have to start listening to parents and taking cues from them as nobody knows the child better than parents. Our children are not case A or case B they are unique individuals in their own world. Remember we are the experts on our children; not the therapists.
• Inclusion in schools cannot be lip service or a buzzword. It is not rocket science but it takes effort, patience and commitment. And yes, a big heart!
• We need to stop the dehumanising approach of “let’s fix” the child. Children can sense when we believe that there is something wrong with them or that they are damaged. Imagine what it does to their sense of dignity to know that their parents wish they were different.
• Next time a relative rolls their eyes at your ‘badly behaved child” or your child’s teacher tells you that he is not capable of learning, take a deep breath, smile and tell them, “He experiences life differently. Let me know if you want to learn more about it.”Advertisement
• Like all children, even our children need mothers who are healthy and happy. It’s not going to help you or your child if you deplete yourself to the ground.
• Khod, khod ke raasta banaya he (I have dug out my own path): There have been people in my life who have said, “She cannot finish school, she cannot do a job, she cannot get a salary”. But I decided that I will not allow it, I will not let their limited thinking hold me back or define my daughter’s life. Without grudges, as it was not that they were wrong but they were not capable of knowing better. I have faith in my daughter and in my decisions.
ALSO READ | The audacity of being queer
• Advocacy is about solidarity: There is no one right way of parenting! So let’s stop judging and instead shoulder each other up and be each others’ strength.
Mothers, it’s time we stop apologising and instead practice advocacy – for them and with them. As a young person with autism declared, “We are different and proud.”Advertisement
“Different and proud,” are the words that echoed in my head as I see Roni rouse himself from his nap and watch me with an unblinking stare with his big gorgeous eyes. Naina gathers him in a tight hug and tickles him and says, “He is my sunshine. He lights up my world.” As Roni and Naina break into giggles, I smile and sigh with renewed faith, “Advocacy and not apology because all our children light up our world.”

Does Your Child Have Frequent Tummy Aches?Premium Story,"Repeated abdominal pain is one of the most common complaints in children. This can happen due to common conditions like indigestion, gastritis, food poisoning, constipation, viral infections of the stomach and intestines. It can also be a sign of slightly rare but increasingly common causes such as celiac disease (gluten or wheat allergy), Inflammatory Bowel Disease (ulcers and swelling in stomach and intestines) or food allergies. Register Now.

If your child has frequent tummy aches, make sure your child is eating a healthy and a balanced diet. To ensure this, you can add more green vegetables and fruits to their diet and reduce processed and packaged foods. Adequate intake of water approximating to 1-2 litres per day will also help with tummy aches. It will also help to monitor your child’s stooling pattern. Using a footstool to rest their legs while on the pot, will go a long way in ensuring your child is able to evacuate an adequate amount of stool. If your child has fever or loose stools, this could be the beginning of a stomach bug. In that case, please seek the advice of your pediatrician or a specialist like a Pediatric Gastroenterologist. Some of the danger signs to look for are reduced urination, reduced intake of fluids, excessive loose stools, persistent vomiting and abdominal pain. If these episodes happen repeatedly and/or are associated with poor weight gain, it is advisable to seek consultation of an expert Pediatric Gastroenterologist to get your child evaluated for Celiac disease, IBD and food allergies. 
Based on the symptoms, your doctor might need to order some tests to diagnose the root cause of your child’s tummy ache. These can be blood tests to look for infection, Ultrasound of abdomen, X ray abdomen, Urine routine and stool routine tests. Early diagnosis and treatment of stomach infections is very important as it helps reduce the risk of dehydration and hence the need for hospitalisation. At home, you can make sure your child stays hydrated by giving water, coconut water and WHO recommended ORS. Your child’s appetite for solids might reduce drastically but it is critical to ensure adequate intake of fluids. 
Whether it is acute onset stomach infections or chronic repeated episodes of stomach aches, please seek the guidance of your doctor or an expert Pediatric Gastroenterologist, to ensure early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, before the stomachache starts having a negative impact on your child’s growth.

Autism Spectrum Disorder and EpilepsyPremium Story,"Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) refers to a group of complex neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction. Restrictive repetitive and stereotyped pattern of behavior and interests.

ASD was once considered an uncommon disorder, but in the last 15 years high quality studies have demonstrated an increase in the detected prevalence. 1 in 68 children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. 
Epilepsy is the most common neurological condition in India. Electrical activity is happening in the brain all the time. When there is a sudden, intense burst of electrical activity, this briefly disrupts the way the brain normally works, so the brain’s messages become mixed-up, and this leads to an epileptic seizure. Epilepsy is the tendency to have recurrent epileptic seizures.  
Epilepsy and ASD frequently coexist in the same individual at a much higher rate than would be expected by chance alone. About 1 in 10 children with ASD also have epilepsy. 
There is complex relationship between ASD, epilepsy and intellectual disability.  There are many theories regarding regression of skills in ASD where more research is needed. Intellectual disability increases the risk of epilepsy within children with autism. There are many genetic and metabolic conditions associated with both ASD and epilepsy. Some evidence to say there are two peaks of epilepsy onset in infancy and adolescence. 
There are many challenges in the diagnosis of epilepsy in children with ASD. There are many non-epileptic conditions like sensory and self-stimulatory behaviours,  blank spells, stereotyped behaviours hand flapping and body rocking which may be difficult to distinguish from epileptic-seizures. 
Careful history from parents with video recording of the movements, EEG, Video EEG can all help in the diagnosis. 
The main principles of anti-seizure medication is to improve participation, improve quality of life and reduce risk of harm from seizures. Choosing the correct drug for each individual child is important considering the seizure type and any behavioural problems. Parents should be trained in first aid for seizures and use of rescue medication like midazolam nasal spray.
In conclusion every child and family with ASD and epilepsy will have their own challenges and will need individualized treatment.

Air pollution in India linked to cognitive problems in babies: Study,"Poor air quality in India may be associated with impaired cognition in infants under the age of two, when brain growth is at its peak, according to a study.
Cognition is the process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses.
Without action, the researchers said, the negative impact on children’s long-term brain development could have consequences for life.Advertisement
“Prior work has shown that poor air quality is linked to cognitive deficits in children, as well as to emotional and behavioural problems, which can have a severe impact on families,” said lead researcher Professor John Spencer, from the University of East Anglia, UK.
“Very small particulate fragments in the air are a major concern as they can move from the respiratory tract into the brain,” Spencer said.
Until now, studies have failed to show a link between poor air quality and cognitive problems in babies, when brain growth is at its peak and the brain may be particularly sensitive to toxins.
“We worked with families in rural India to see how in-home air quality affects infants’ cognition,” Spencer said.Advertisement
The team collaborated with the Community Empowerment Lab in Lucknow, India—a global health research and innovation organisation that works with rural communities to engage in science collaboratively.
They worked with families from a range of socio-economic backgrounds in Shivgarh, a rural community in Uttar Pradesh—one of the states most strongly impacted by poor air quality.
The study, published in the journal eLife, assessed the visual working memory and visual processing speed of 215 infants using a specially-designed cognition task from October 2017 to June 2019.
On one display, the toddlers were shown flashing coloured squares that were always the same after each ‘blink’. On a second display, one coloured square changed after each blink.Advertisement
“This task capitalises on infant’s tendency to look away from something that’s visually familiar and towards something new,” Spencer said.
“We were interested in whether infants could detect the changing side and how well they did as we made the task harder by including more squares on each display,” the researcher added.
The team used air quality monitors in the children’s homes to measure emission levels and air quality. They also took into account and controlled for family socio-economic status.
“This research shows for the first time that there is an association between poor air quality and impaired visual cognition in the first two years of life, when brain growth is at its peak,” said Spencer.Advertisement
“Such impacts could carry forward across years, negatively impacting long-term development,” he added.
The research also indicates that global efforts to improve air quality could have benefits to infants’ emerging cognitive abilities.
“This, in turn, could have a cascade of positive impacts because improved cognition can lead to improved economic productivity in the long term and reduce the burden on healthcare and mental health systems,” said Spencer.

One key factor the team measured was the cooking fuel commonly used at home. “We found that air quality was poorer in homes that used solid cooking materials like cow dung cake. Therefore, efforts to reduce cooking emissions in homes should be a key target for intervention,” he added.

Parents worry about children’s excessive screen time during vacations,"Children’s excessive screen time has been a cause of concern for most parents. With schools shutting down for the summer vacation, parents are increasingly concerned as they look out for ways to keep their children busy during the holidays.
A survey conducted by Kantar for Amazon in March 2023 revealed that 85% parents of 3–8-year-olds are worried about their children’s screen time and a whopping 96% are actively looking for screen-free learning and fun activities to engage their children.
Deepender Rana, Executive Managing Director, Insights Division, Kantar, commented, “Kids are curious to learn new things and want to have fun in the process. With more free time at hand during summer vacations, parents have a big task ahead of themselves to keep their kids engaged.”Advertisement
Over 90% parents believed that excessive screen time makes children less active. Though most parents opined that children should not have screen time of more than 2 hours a day, 69% parents claimed that their children spent more than 3 hours on screen.

82% parents expressed concern over keeping their kids engaged during the summer vacation. The survey results indicate that parents in metro and non-metro cities want to find creative ways to reduce boredom in their children, keep pace with their curiosity of learning, and ensure that their children enjoy the learning process.
Parents want their children to utilise their vacations picking up key skills such as English speaking (50%); learning good morals and social manners (45%); engaging in performing arts like dancing, singing and playing musical instruments (36%); doing arts and crafts (32%); and taking part in physical & outdoor activities (32%).

An interesting finding of the survey is that 66% parents were keen on buying a voice controlled smart speaker, such as Alexa, that can nurture curiosity, concentration, and communication skills of children. Over 95% parents asserted that using Alexa not only helps reduce screen time for their children but also keeps them engaged with interactive games, music, trivia, and educational content.Advertisement
Some of the requests parents often make to Alexa are “Alexa, what is the spelling of dinosaurs”, “Alexa, why is the sky blue?”, “Alexa, open Wild Planet”, “Alexa, tell me a bedtime story”, and so on.
Parag Gupta, Director and Country Manager for Amazon Devices India, concludes, “No surprises when we see kids’ songs like Twinkle Twinkle, Chandaniya, and Baby Shark rule the list of top five most requested music to Alexa.”

Childhood Trauma – What it is and how to heal itPremium Story,"Trauma is an invisible pain. When left unaddressed, it can have long-term consequences on the quality of a person’s life. 
Below is an excerpt from a 42-year-old woman:
“…My mother told me she regretted giving birth to me. She would call me dumb and stupid all the time as a child. If I made any mistake, she would dig her nails into my ear lobe or thighs till it would bleed or hit me with the wooden scale. No one outside the home knew this wretched side of her, apart from my sister and I. I struggle with anxiety, low self-esteem and cannot trust people.”
What’s meant to be the safest environment in the world is supposedly the worst. As a psychologist, I hear many personal stories of traumatic experiences, parental abuse and neglect, often from childhood, but these experiences continue to weigh them down heavily.Advertisement
Childhood is a time in one’s life which is meant to be fun, safe and filled with love. Psychological evidence says that our childhood experiences provide the foundation for future growth, learning, and health and influence success as an adult. As a parent, you would do anything to make your child’s world better as there is nothing more difficult than seeing them in pain, emotional or physical. This article will help you learn about childhood trauma and some ways to support and heal yourself or your loved ones. Children and teenagers are not equipped to deal with abuse, adults struggle to cope too.
The National Institute of Mental Health defines childhood trauma as the experience or witnessing of an event by a child that is emotionally painful or distressful, which often results in lasting mental and physical effects. Common causes include:

 Regular physical punishment and/or verbal abuse
 Sexual abuse
 Bullying and cyber-bullying
 Parents – regular conflict, going through divorce, additions, critical illness, death
 Being uncared for or not protected at home (neglect)
Events such as accidents, war, etc.

The child goes through helplessness without trusted adults to guide them. They struggle to find comfort. This leads to shame, guilt, fear, isolation, anxiety, addictions and so on. Here are some ways to cope:

Encourage therapy and counselling – The right professional can help uncover and offload the impact of trauma. Especially if the impact includes nightmares, panic attacks, substance abuse, self-harm, outbursts or depression. One such psychotherapeutic approach is Compassionate Inquiry, which is trauma-informed. The process facilitates the person to access implicit memories stored in the mind and body and heal with compassion. It’s important to find appropriate coping strategies to prevent spiralling downwards.
Journaling – This involves writing your thoughts and feelings on a paper about the incidents. Spend time on it daily over several days, it is very therapeutic. Gradually, you will feel a sense of relief.
Soothing Activities – Engage in activities and exercises that you find soothing. I’m listing out some common ones that most people enjoy: Making Art – sketching, painting, collage making; listening to music; indulging in physical movement such as running/sport/ yoga.
 Empathy – Look through their eyes and hearts. Often, experiences of past traumatic incidents are minimised by statements such as forget about it, it happens to so many people, move on, etc. Instead, allow the person to talk freely where you focus on listening and understanding with empathy.

To conclude, physical and psychological abuse from a parent can impair a child, pre-teen or teenager’s emotional development and self-worth for life. The most trusted and secure humans to be with are, our parents. So be mindful when you are triggered or angry, so you don’t say or do something that has effects that are so serious and long-lasting as I know that’s not your intention.Advertisement

"Pediatric TB found to affect lung function, growth post-recovery","A new study shows that young children, aged 5 years or younger, diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) are at an increased risk of subsequent wheezing, poor lung function, and reduced height and weight later in their childhood.
The scientists from Boston University School of Public Health, US, involved in the study said while there are treatments for children who develop PTB, no studies have examined the long-term impact of this disease on children’s health post-recovery.
They have published their study in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.Advertisement
For the study, study lead and corresponding author Leonardo Martinez and colleagues from the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, the University of Cape Town, and the University of Western Australia followed a cohort of 1,068 children from birth up to nine years old in two communities outside of Cape Town, from March 2012 to March 2015.
The researchers found that children in the study who developed TB before one year of age had a lower weight and BMI for their age by the time they turned five years old, and those who developed PTB between one and four years of age had a lower length for their age.
The researchers also found that children who developed PTB were at a greater risk of post-TB wheezing, regardless of when they developed the infection. Children who developed PTB before they were six months old were found to have more than double the risk of wheezing after 6 months, compared to children who did not develop PTB.
The risk of subsequent wheezing also increased when children developed PTB before they were 12 months, 24 months, or 36 months old.Advertisement
The team also found that PTB was associated with lung function impairments that persisted for years after the acute infection and illness.
“Although there is an effective treatment for tuberculosis in children, there is concern that the impact of tuberculosis may be long-lasting and there could be long-term morbidity even after treatment and recovery,” said Martinez, assistant professor of epidemiology.
“These results suggest that prevention of tuberculosis disease in the first few years of life may have substantial long-term health benefits, in particular to lung health, through childhood,” said Martinez.
Study senior author Heather Zar, chair of the Department of Paediatrics and Child Health at the University of Cape Town, said that the study leveraged a unique opportunity to observe children who were enrolled in the South African Drakenstein Child Health Study, a birth cohort study.Advertisement
“Given the large burden of childhood TB in low- and middle-income countries, these results are crucial in delineating the burden and morbidity associated with TB illness, and in strengthening preventive interventions,” Zar says.

Why children don’t talk to adults about problems they encounter onlinePremium Story,"“I don’t listen to adults when it comes to this sort of thing”, a 17-year-old told me.
We were discussing how digital technology affects his life, as part of a long-term project in the west of England that I carried out with colleagues to explore young people’s mental health – including the impact of digital technology on their emotional wellbeing.
There is a widespread perception that being online is bad for young people’s mental health. But when we began the project, we quickly realised that there was very little evidence to back this up. The few in-depth studies around social media use and children’s mental health state that impacts are small, and it is difficult to draw clear conclusions.Advertisement
We wanted to find out if and how young people’s wellbeing was actually being affected in order to produce resources to help them. We talked to around 1,000 young people as part of our project. What we found was that there was a disconnect between what young people were worried about when it came to their online lives, and the worries their parents and other adults had.
One of the things young people told us was that adults tended to talk down to them about online harms and had a tendency to “freak out” about these issues. Young people told us that adults’ views about online harms rarely reflected their own. They felt frustrated that they were being told what was harmful, rather than being asked what their experiences were.
Common concerns
The concerns the young people told us they had included bullying and other forms of online conflict. They were afraid of missing out on both online group interactions and real-life experiences others were showing in their social media posts. They worried that their posts were not getting as many likes as someone else’s.
But these concerns are rarely reflected in the media presentation of the harsher side of online harms. This has a tendency to explore the criminal side of online abuse, such as grooming, the prevalence of online pornography. It also tends to describe social media use in similar language to that used to talk about addiction.Advertisement
It is no surprise, therefore, that parents might approach conversations with young people with excessive concern and an assumption their children are being approached by predators or are accessing harmful or illegal content.
We have run a survey with young people for several years on their online experiences. Our latest analysis was based on 8,223 responses. One of the questions we ask is: “Have you ever been upset by something that has happened online?”. While there are differences between age groups, we found the percentage of those young people who say “yes” is around 30 per cent. Or, to put it another way, more than two-thirds of the young people surveyed had never had an upsetting experience online.
Meanwhile, the online experiences reported by the 30 per cent who reported being upset often didn’t tally with the extreme cases reporting in the media. Our analysis of responses showed that this upset is far more likely to come from abusive comments by peers and news stories about current affairs.
This disconnect means that young people are reluctant to talk to adults about their concerns. They are afraid of being told off, that the adult will overreact, or that talking to an adult might make the issue worse. The adults they might turn to need to make it clear this won’t happen and that they can help.
How to helpAdvertisement
 If a parent has concerns, having a conversation with tutors can be a useful way of supporting the young person. (Source: Pixabay)
There are three things that young people have consistently told us over the duration of the project, and in our previous work, that adults can do to help. They are: listen and understand – don’t judge.
Conversations are important, as is showing an interest in young people’s online lives. However, those conversations do not have to be confrontational. If a media story about young people and online harms causes parents concern or alarm, the conversation does not have to start with: “Do you do this?” This can result in a defensive response and the conversation being shut down. It would be far better to introduce the topic with: “Have you seen this story? What do you think of this?” Working in partnership with others, such as schools, is also important. If a parent has concerns, having a conversation with tutors can be a useful way of supporting the young person. The tutor might also be aware that the young person is not acting like themselves or might have noticed changes in group dynamics among their peer group.
But, even if they are not aware of anything, raising concerns with them – and discussing from where those concerns arise – will mean both parents and school are focused on the same direction. It is important that young people receive both consistent messages and support. And schools will also be able to link up with other support services if they are needed.
Ultimately, we want young people to feel confident that they can ask for help and receive it. This is particularly important, because if they do not feel they can ask for help, it is far less likely the issue they are facing will be resolved – and there is a chance things might become worse without support.Advertisement

Take Time: How to manage exam anxiety and cope with pressurePremium Story,"Almost everyone feels nervous or experiences some level of anxiety when faced with an exam, assessment, or performance situation. This is a common and natural response for many students or adults at the time of preparation, before or during exams.
A moderate level of anxiety or stress is crucial to perform well – this helps one to be psychologically and physically alert during an exam or assessment situation. The challenge is when the level of anxiety increases past an optimal level such that it interferes with one’s preparation or performance. When anxiety is too intense, one may have a difficulty learning and remembering the needful for the exam. It is possible to learn effective ways to manage stress so that it does not take over or get in the way of one’s performance.
Identify your triggers
The skills you will find most helpful in managing exam anxiety will depend on what factors may be contributing to this. Exam anxiety may be related to:Advertisement

Negative past experiences of exams
Lack of adequate preparation, or knowledge of exam-taking techniques or study methods
Unhelpful thinking about the exam situation (for example, I am going to lose control, I cannot do this, I cannot remember anything, I am going to fail)
Excessive pressure to achieve and/or perfectionism, thus setting unrealistic goals
Poor self-care, including insufficient sleep, unhealthy eating, lack of exercise or relaxation.

Taking some time to understand and identify what is contributing to your particular experience of anxiety can help you develop an effective plan to deal with it.
Plan ahead of time 

Find a quiet place to study without distractions.
Set-up your study space. Make sure it is not too cluttered and has everything you might need.
Find out as much as you can about the exam so you can prepare for it.
Ask your teacher if you are unsure of what will be asked.
Learn to make ‘mind maps’ and use them to collect ideas and thoughts, use bright colours to help remember important links.
Make a plan of what you want to work on in each study session. Break it down into small tasks and work on one task at a time.
Take regular short breaks – use this time to relax, get something to eat or take a short walk.
Ask for help — if you are having trouble with something you are studying, ask a teacher, friend, sibling or parent to help.
Maintain a book where you write only pointers of all the answers. On the day of the exam, only skim through that.
Use a highlighter, coloured pens or post-aids to mark out important pointers. 
Audio record your own voice. If you find any specific answer tough, hearing your own voice repeatedly will make learning a lot easier for you. 
Make mnemonics to learn certain tough terminologies. For example, how we learn the colours of the rainbow by learning the acronym: VIBGYOR
It is also very important to identify if you are an audio or visual learner and draft out your study material accordingly. 

On the day of the exam
It is believed that studying anything 20-30 minutes before the exam, is a major cause of anxiety faced during the examination. Avoid doing the same, and also avoid asking your friends about what is important and what is not. Studying last minute is going to make you more anxious and the possibility of remembering is minimal.  

Do not enter the examination on an empty stomach
Sleep for at least 6-7 hours prior to writing the exam
Do not study anything 30 minutes before the exam
Stay away from negative people who will add to your stress
Keep yourself well hydrated, carry juice/Electrol with you, sometimes it can be very handy
Check your stationery well in advance to avoid last-minute hassles
Practice deep breathing exercises if you feel very nervous
Open and close your fist if you are anxious and feel any kind of stiffness
Ask for permission to stand up and stretch, sometimes your muscles can get tensed if you are stressed, stretching can help you destress. 

In case the situation is beyond your control, ask for help.
Coping with pressureAdvertisement
Internal pressures stem from pushing yourself too hard, or from worrying about your ability to meet others’ expectations of you and those that you have of yourself.
Understand your pressures
Think about all of the pressures you have. It might be  helpful to jot them down.  Are there issues that come up regularly or is it a one-off situation that is worrying you? Acknowledging them, even if you can’t avoid them, can help you prepare for them.
Get organised
Organising your time can help you feel more in control.  Make a list – getting things out of your head onto a list can help clear your mind and help you see things more clearly. Work through the most important thing first. Once you have completed it, the others will feel easier. Do not forget to cross it off your list – it is satisfying seeing the list shrink.
Take it slow
When we have a lot of pressure and are getting stressed, we can find it hard to be productive or concentrate. Do not try and do too much at once, give yourself time and concentrate on one thing at a time. Even if you do not complete it all at once, recognise the progress you have made. It will make it less daunting to carry on next time.
Vary your tasksAdvertisement
We all have things we do not enjoy, but we still have to do them. Vary your tasks between those you like and those you do not. This helps you stop putting things off or leaving them all to do at once.
Accept things you cannot change
There are some things or situations that we cannot change. Recognising this is not easy but, once you can, it means that you park them and put your efforts into the things you can do something about.

Every individual at some point of their life feels anxious, confused and stressed during a specific situation. What we need to do is often rationalise with the situation and accept that it is only a temporary phase.

Holiday help! An art expert suggests screen-free things to do in every room of the housePremium Story,"School holidays can feel like a marathon if all the kids want to do is watch TV, play Minecraft or repeatedly ask you for the iPad.
There are lots of things you can do inside the house that do not involve a screen. And will help ward off any whines along the lines of: “I’m booooooored”.
Here are five creative ideas to try in every room of the house.
In the kitchen: make your own paintAdvertisement
Kids enjoy making potions in the garden by adding dirt and flowers and you can have similar fun in the kitchen making paint from ingredients in the cupboard. Paint is made with pigment and a binder.
The first paint on cave walls was made with charcoal, ochre, minerals mixed with water, saliva, blood, animal fat and even wee. The history of paint is fascinating, and kids are intrigued by the stories, like how a certain purple (tyrian) comes from the glands of sea snails and how a type of yellow was cruelly made from cow wee, after forcing them to eat mango leaves.
You can make your own paint with spices like turmeric, curry powder and cinnamon or hunt through the house for chalk and eye shadow for a variety of colours.
Grind the pigments up with a mortar and pestle (some will need this more than others but it’s a fun part of the process).Advertisement
Then in a glass or jar, mix your ground pigments with a bit of egg yolk, a teaspoon of vinegar and a small amount of water as a binder and you have made egg tempera – a type of paint the Egyptians discovered, and some artists still use today.
Experiment with other spices, berries, grass or charcoal. If it’s colourful, you can grind it and its not too lumpy, give it a go. See how many colours you can make, then make a painting.
In the living room: create a box masterpiece
Kids who may not like to draw or paint often love construction. So, collect different types of boxes and see what your child can create.
Apart from the boxes, you will also need masking tape. Kids can tear it themselves or use a dispenser. Staplers and hole punchers are good connectors too. Also give them some thick markers, fabric scraps and glue to add details to their creations.Advertisement
One holiday, we lived around my daughter’s construction zone as she worked with cardboard, other items from the recycling bin and things from around the house to make her own house.
In your child’s bedroom: paint a mural
 The trick to creating a successful mural with kids is selecting a good colour palette and you really can’t go wrong. (Source: Freepik)
This won’t be possible for everyone but think about letting your child paint a mural in their bedroom. My mum let us create fantastic scenes in our bedrooms growing up.
Start by mapping out a basic design on paper. This slows the process down, allowing the child to think about what they would like on their walls. But be prepared for the plan to go out the window. Sometimes as artists we respond to the materials when we get them in our hands.
The trick to creating a successful mural with kids is selecting a good colour palette and you really can’t go wrong.Advertisement
Get some sample-sized pots of water-based interior paint and bristle brushes from the hardware shop. Then tape a drop sheet to the floor and cover anything else you don’t want covered in paint and go for it! If this is too freestyle for you, have a look at the wonderful “field of flowers” activity in Hervé Tullet’s book, Art Workshops for Children.
This is a more structured approach to a collaborative painting and yields beautiful results (it starts with dots, then dots within dots and you end up with a field of flowers).
If this is not possible where you live, consider liquid chalk pens to create murals on the windows. This is so much fun, and you can play with tracing things outside the window.
Pick an array of colours and overlap line drawings to build up patterns on the glass. This is so easy to clean too – just wipe it off with a wet cloth.
In the dining room: make a comicAdvertisement
The dining table is the perfect spot for projects and drawing. I find kids love creating comics. The book Making Comics by Lynda Barry has excellent exercises to get you started on comic strips, storyboards and zines.
Zines are mini-DIY booklets. You can fill them with ideas using drawing, collage and words. Check out my how to make a zine video done for the National Museum of Australia’s Ancient Greeks exhibition last year.
You could do something similar: take your young person to see an exhibition, collect some flyers or postcards, and then at home cut them up and stick them into a zine.
This can extend your child’s museum experience and provides a chance to discuss and make sense of what you saw together.
Children use drawing to make sense of the world around them. When my son was five, he made a comic about a gallery experience: how he didn’t want to go, how he felt about some of the artworks, and how he was relieved to get out because he was scared by some of the work.Advertisement
This gave me the opportunity to see how strongly he was affected by the exhibition and we were able to talk about those feelings.
In the bathroom: crack open the shaving cream 
Shaving cream is a great medium with endless possibilities for sensory play, which helps brain development, motor skills and more.
You can make slime by adding a cup of glue to two cups of shaving cream and sprinkling a teaspoon of baking powder in the mix, plus two teaspoons of saline solution. Add food dye for a marble effect, make prints and paint with it onto a mirror or bathtub.
You can also use it to make sculptures. Start with a shampoo bottle as your armature (inner structure) and build your form around it. Take photos of the sculptures as a way of recording the ephemeral creations.
Try adding cornstarch to the shaving cream and play with the proportions until you have developed a malleable substance. The transformation of the substance is quite remarkable, and kids love the tactile quality of this mixture.Advertisement
In the end, kids have the best ideas, so just take some time to ask them what kinds of creative activities they might like to explore over the holidays and let them take the lead.
The important thing here is to let go, enjoy the process and play – worry about cleaning up later!

Health benefits of living in cities for children and teens diminishing: Study,"The advantages of living in cities for young people’s healthy growth and development are shrinking across much of the world, according to a global analysis of trends in child and adolescent height and body mass index (BMI).
The research, by a global consortium of over 1500 researchers and physicians, analysed height and weight data from 71 million children and adolescents (aged 5 to 19 years) across urban and rural areas of 200 countries from 1990 to 2020.
Cities can provide a multitude of opportunities for better education, nutrition, sports and recreation, and healthcare that contributed to school-aged children and adolescents living in cities being taller than their rural counterparts in the 20th century in all but a few wealthy countries.Advertisement
The study, published recently in the journal Nature, found that in the 21st century, this urban height advantage shrank in most countries as a result of accelerating improvements in height for children and adolescents in rural areas.
The researchers also assessed children’s BMI, an indicator of whether they have a healthy weight for their height.
They found that on average children living in cities had a slightly higher BMI than children in rural areas in 1990. By 2020, BMI averages rose for most countries, albeit faster for urban children, except in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, where BMI rose faster in rural areas.
Nevertheless, over the 30-year period, the gap between urban and rural BMI remained small—less than 1.1 kilogrammes per square metre (kg/m²) globally, the researchers said.Advertisement

“Cities continue to provide considerable health benefits for children and adolescents,” said Anu Mishra, lead author of the study, from Imperial College London’s School of Public Health.
“Fortunately, in most regions, rural areas are catching up to cities thanks to modern sanitation and improvements in nutrition and healthcare,” Mishra said.
The results of this large global study challenge the commonly held perceptions about the negative aspects of living in cities around nutrition and health, the researcher added.
While height and BMI has increased around the world since 1990, the researchers found that the degree of change between urban and rural areas varied greatly among different middle and low-income countries, while small urban-rural differences remained stable across high-income countries.Advertisement
Middle-income and emerging economies, such as Chile, Taiwan, and Brazil, have seen the biggest gains in rural children’s height over the three decades, with children living in rural areas growing to similar heights as their urban counterparts.
“These countries have made great strides in levelling up. Using the resources of economic growth to fund nutrition and health programmes, both through schools and in the community, was key to closing the gaps between different areas and social groups,” said Professor Majid Ezzati, senior author for the study, from Imperial College London. Contrary to the widespread assumption that urbanisation is the main driver of the obesity epidemic, the study found that many high-income western countries have had very little difference in height and BMI over time – with the gap between urban and rural BMI differing by less than one unit in 2020.
“The issue is not so much whether children live in cities or urban areas, but where the poor live, and whether governments are tackling growing inequalities with initiatives like supplementary incomes and free school meal programmes,” Ezzati added.
The trend in sub-Saharan Africa is also a cause for concern, the researchers said. “Rural sub-Saharan Africa is now the global epicentre of poor growth and development for children and adolescents,” said Professor Andre Pascal Kengne, co-author for the study, from the South African Medical Research Council.Advertisement
“As the cost of food skyrockets and countries finances get worse due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, the rural poor in Africa are at risk of falling further behind,” Kengne said.
Faltering growth in school-aged children and adolescents is strongly linked to poor health through life, lost educational attainment and the immense cost of unrealised human potential, the researchers added.

Over-emphasis on safety means kids are becoming more anxious and less resilientPremium Story,"We are facing a mental health crisis. Teenagers and young adults are more depressed, suicidal, anxious and lonely than ever before.
Depression rates among teens have been increasing since the early 2000s. A 2018 national survey found that 13.3 per cent of U.S. adolescents experienced a major depressive episode in the last year.
But it’s not just teens — young adults are suffering too. A 2016 international survey of university counselling centres revealed 50 per cent of university students sought help for feelings of anxiety and 41 per cent for depression. Suicide rates are also increasing. The number of teenage girls in the U.S. who died by suicide nearly doubled between 2000 and 2015.Advertisement
The mental health statistics for Canadian youth are similarly grim. In 2003, 24 per cent of Canadians aged 15-30 self-reported that their mental health was either fair or poor (compared to very good or excellent). By 2019, that number had risen to 40 per cent.
The COVID-19 pandemic worsened the mental health of Canadian youths. In 2020, 58 per cent of Canadians aged 15-24 reported fair or poor mental health and nearly one in four hospitalizations for children and youth aged 5-24 were due to mental health conditions.
What has changed in the last decade to explain this rise in poor mental health among youth? Some psychologists point to the recent cultural emphasis on safety as a contributor.
Shift in children’s safety
In previous decades, American and Canadian children enjoyed more freedom, even though there were rising crime rates. The crime wave in Canada rose steeply from the 60s through the 80s until it peaked in the early 1990s. Cable TV became widespread during the same period, meaning that news of crimes spread farther and quicker than ever before.Advertisement
This surge spurred safety initiatives like sharing pictures of missing children on milk cartons and crime shows like America’s Most Wanted. It’s no wonder parents became increasingly fearful and protective.
Crime rates began to come down in the 1990s, but fear among parents remained. This is where the problem of being over cautious begins. The concept of safety started to extend beyond children’s physical safety to emotional and psychological comfort. This denied children experiences they needed to learn and grow.
Parental overprotection has been shown to foster unhealthy coping mechanisms in children. Overprotected children are more likely to both internalize problems (as in anxiety and depression) and externalize them (as in delinquency, defiance or substance abuse).
Some psychologists propose that overprotection can morph into what they call “safetyism,” which teaches kids negative thought patterns similar to those experienced by the anxious and depressed. Safetyism can over-prioritize a young person’s safety to the exclusion of other practical and moral concerns.Advertisement
It is natural to want to avoid problems, but avoiding things that bring us discomfort can reinforce a belief that we cannot handle certain issues and, over time, make us less capable.
Unhelpful thought patterns
 2016 international survey of university counselling centres revealed 50 per cent of university students sought help for feelings of anxiety and 41 per cent for depression. (Source: Freepik)
Here are three unhealthy thought patterns to monitor in yourself and your children: Identify negative filtering.
Do not underestimate the positives of experiences like unsupervised play (joy, independence, problem-solving, risk-assessment, resilience) when considering the potential negative consequences.
Be aware of dichotomous thinking. Do not fall into the good or bad trap. There’s a world of possibility between one or the other. Considering people, ideas, places or situations as either good or evil (but never both or somewhere in between) fosters a polarizing “us vs. them” attitude and eliminates nuance.Advertisement
Recognise emotional reasoning. Feeling “unsafe” (uncomfortable or anxious), does not mean you are actually physically unsafe. If you avoid all stress, you will never learn to overcome stressors or understand your full potential. Avoiding hurdles can make us think we are more weak or fragile than we are.
Painting the world as a place with dangers at every turn has created anxious youths who avoid activities they previously would have experimented with. Rising rates of loneliness and anxiety mean some youth are delaying getting a job, driving a car, having sex, drinking alcohol and dating. Research supports that overprotective parenting (such as “helicopter parenting”) decreases adolescents’ well-being, motivation, independence and ability to deal with problems in a healthy way.
Generational trends show that across all social and economic demographics, American teens are putting off activities they deem “adult” and don’t crave adult freedom as previous generations did.
They spend less time unsupervised by parents because they’re worried about what’s out in the world, and they think they can’t handle it. They don’t date or have sex because they’re worried about broken hearts, pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. They don’t drink alcohol because they’re worried about drunkenly making mistakes and what people will think of them afterwards. They don’t drive because they are happy to rely on their parents for transportation.Advertisement
While some of these are rational consequences to avoid, they shouldn’t feel so overwhelming as to keep youths from transitioning into adulthood. Broken hearts teach you about what you want in a romantic partner, young people can be taught about safe sex, alcohol can be drunk in moderate amounts and mistakes are healthy, human and normal. Teens shouldn’t be so afraid of life that they no longer feel excited to live it.
Without opportunities to explore and learn their limits, youths risk internalising a false sense of helplessness and becoming depressed and anxious.
Helpful thought patterns
Positive thought patterns must be developed within ourselves. That means giving ourselves, our teens and our children the opportunities needed to become independent, resilient and autonomous. And that means embracing negative experiences like frustration, conflict and boredom.
Here are some words of advice:
Mind your mind. Your thoughts are powerful. They dictate how you see the world, others and yourself, so foster positive, rational thought patterns.Advertisement
Raise your voice. Encourage curiosity and productive disagreement. We will never learn to be open-minded or become well-rounded people if we do not challenge our own beliefs, listen to others’ perspectives and recognize our potential to be wrong. Every aspect of our lives, including our relationships and jobs, depends on our ability to argue in an effective, respectful and productive way without becoming overemotional.
Open your heart. Try to give others the benefit of the doubt because most people do not intend to do harm. Do not let fear dictate your thoughts and actions.

How parents feel about feelings can deeply affect a child’s developmentPremium Story,"How our families express feelings, talk about feelings and react to feelings can have ripple effects into the next generation.
When someone becomes a parent, the models they had can become embedded in how they in turn parent.
A parent’s organised set of thoughts and feelings about their own and their child’s feelings is what some psychologists call “parental meta-emotion philosophy.” Understanding this can make a big difference in parenting and children’s development.
I lead research projects that investigate the usefulness of programmes that teach parents how to understand their “feelings about feelings” and guide their children in healthy emotional regulation and coping strategies.
The family emotional climateAdvertisement
All of us have a long emotional history that comes from the emotional climate we grew up with. Early experiences become ingrained in how we feel about feelings and affect our ability to form healthy relationships.
Based on their emotional history, some parents become good at what psychologists call emotion coaching.
These parents have learned to recognise and accept their feelings, for example that “it is okay to be sad.” They are aware of their children’s lower-intensity feelings and view their children’s emotional displays as a time for connection and teaching.
Becoming aware of feelings
Other parents have learned to ignore or deny their feelings and develop a tendency to dismiss emotions. These parents tend to avoid uncomfortable feelings like sadness and anger. Emotionally dismissive parents will likely try to make uncomfortable feelings in children go away quickly or brush them off by saying things like “you’ll get over it.” Gaining the ability to be aware of, understand and manage feelings is an important part of child development. Studies have shown that parents who have an “emotion coaching” philosophy support their children’s emotional regulation, behaviour and social skills.
The question is, how effective is teaching parents to understand their “feelings about feelings” at improving the family emotional climate and child development outcomes.
Parenting programmesAdvertisement
Parent education programmes teach parents about children’s needs and development and offer them tools to enhance their parenting behaviours. Some parenting classes and programmes are delivered through organizations like family centres and social services.
Others are offered through medical clinics like pediatricians’ offices. There are many programmes that help parents respond to children’s challenging behaviours — for example, teaching parents how to positively reinforce children’s appropriate behaviours.
More recently, some parenting programmes have begun to focus on parents’ feelings about feelings: emotion-focused parenting programmes. These programmes teach parents specific parenting behaviours that support their children’s emotional needs.
One such programme is called Tuning in to Kids. It was developed in Australia and teaches parents how to become “emotion coaches” who emotionally connect with their children, label and validate their children’s feelings, and help their children solve problems.Advertisement
Another example is the Emotional Development version of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy, which strengthens relationships and teaches parents how to help their children regulate emotions.
Tailored parenting programmes

In research with my colleagues, Krysta Andrews, Leslie Atkinson and Andrea Gonzalez, I have examined the effectiveness of emotion-focused programmes in a recently published article in Clinical Psychology Review. This article provides strong evidence that emotion-focused parenting programmes can enhance parents’ ability to positively socialise their children’s emotional development and maximise positive outcomes for families.
However, there is a need for families, researchers, clinicians and early childhood development policymakers to work together to find out what programmes work best, when and for whom.
Some of my work suggests that these programmes may especially benefit children and adolescents with complex needs, such as co-occurring mental health problems and neurodevelopmental disorders like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
Children under two, culturally appropriate programmesAdvertisement
Some of my research indicates that emotion-focused parenting programmes should be adapted or developed for specific populations. For example, for parents of children under age two, as this age is a period of vulnerability for long-lasting emotional and behavioural problems.
And, the way families “feel about feelings” is also influenced by social determinants of health, which include socioeconomic factors like culture, racialisation, education, housing and income. This suggests that programmes for parents of children of different ages should also be culturally appropriate. Emotion-focused programmes should be adapted to serve a diversity of caregivers, family structures and backgrounds.
Effects on biology
Parenting is a biological process — hormones, brain regions and chemical messengers in the brain all support parenting behaviours. Programmes that focus on parental meta-emotion philosophy have the groundbreaking ability to change parenting on a behavioural level, but also on a biological level.
Psychology researchers have reason to think that helping parents understand their “feelings about feelings” can change children’s biology. One study found that programme content on emotion development was uniquely related to positive changes in emotion-related parenting and children’s brain signals.Advertisement

It is possible that these behavioural and biological changes can be passed on across generations. Families with parents who understand their “feelings about feelings” will have a positive emotional change now and possibly into future generations.

How to stay positive: Here are four effective methodsPremium Story,"Life can get very demanding. Problems creep up unexpectedly. Stress, anxiety and depression are lurking over one’s shoulder. Positive thinking is a popular topic of interest and discussion. Though it does come across as a cliché, staying positive doesn’t mean looking cheerful and ignoring problems. Instead, it is more about one’s overall viewpoint on life with a disposition to pay attention to all that is well. Thinking good and ‘positive’ thoughts can do much more for a person than improving moods or reducing issues. It will help you find peace of mind, improve your emotional life, and make life’s ups and downs easier to deal with.
According to experts at the Mayo Clinic, USA, positive thinking can increase lifespan, lower rates of depression, improve cardiovascular health, and help build coping skills to manage during challenging times.
Training yourself to look at the brighter side of things can help you reap benefits for your mental health and well-being.Advertisement
Befriend your Mind – Sometimes, you may have a stream of negative thoughts which can take over your entire day. Finding another perspective is crucial so that you don’t drown in them. A technique used often and one you can easily try is to write down the most pressing one and ask yourself what you would say to a friend who is in the same situation. The more you cultivate in this process, the easier it will become to find a positive perspective in your day.
Take for instance, a negative thought such as ‘I am a failure’, or ‘I can’t get anything right’, plagues your mind; what would you say to a friend who says this? You would probably encourage them by saying, ‘You have done well in different areas of your life. You are smart and a resourceful person, not a failure.’ Use the same strategy for yourself.
Motivating Mornings – How you start the morning sets the tone for the day. Start your day with a self-affirming positive statement. Talk to yourself and say, “Today will be a productive day” or “I’m going to have an amazing day.” This exercise prepares your mind from the morning and sets the vibe you want to embrace throughout the day.
Social Group – Certain people share inspiring stories, openly discuss their imperfections and learnings, and have a positive outlook. Being in such a company will affect your line of thinking, spark positivity and growth. It’s not easy to always find such positive and resilient individuals, but you can limit the constant interactions with those in a negative state of mind.Advertisement

Gratitude Gift – Gratitude is a simple word with a powerful meaning. It is appreciating all that you have while celebrating the present. This will programme your mind to recognize the wonderful aspects of your life. Your gratitude cues could be anything small or big, such as memories with your loved ones, achievements of the day, perhaps, even having great Wi-Fi and internet access! You will gradually experience a mood change, from gloomy, low and hostile to a sense of satisfaction and positivity.
I am not saying to avoid or suppress negative emotions and thoughts. Situations occur where thinking about the negative consequences can spring one into action when needed. This is the positive use of negative thinking. However, more often than not, we are caught up in thoughts that cripple us.
Therefore, incorporate these guidelines in any situation during the day to stay positive. Positive thinking has compounding returns, so the more that you practice it, the more peace and harmony you will experience.

‘Hostile’ parenting enhances childrens’ risk of developing lasting mental health problems: Study,"Children on the receiving end of ‘hostile’ parenting at age three were 1.5 times likelier than their peers to develop mental health problems qualified as ‘high risk’ by age nine.
Young children on the receiving end of ‘hostile’ parenting were 1.5 times likelier than their peers to be in the high-risk band of developing lasting mental health problems, a new study has reported.
Researchers charted the children’s mental health symptoms at ages three, five and nine, studying both internalising mental health symptoms, such as anxiety and social withdrawal, and externalising ones, such as impulsivity, aggression and hyperactivity, together.Advertisement
They found that 10 per cent of over 7,500 children studied were at a high-risk for poor mental health and that those exposed to harsh parenting were likely to fall in this group.
The study involved researchers from University of Cambridge, UK, and University College Dublin (UCD), Ireland, and is published in the journal Epidemiology and Psychiatric Sciences.
Hostile parenting involves frequent harsh discipline, that could be physical and/or psychological. It could, for example, involve shouting at children regularly, routine physical punishment, isolating children when they misbehave, damaging their self-esteem, or punishing children unpredictably depending on the parent’s mood.
While the researchers make it clear that parenting style does not definitively determine mental health outcomes, they do argue that mental health professionals, teachers and other practitioners need to be alert to children displaying poor mental health.Advertisement
“The fact that one in 10 children were in the high-risk category for mental health problems is a concern and we ought to be aware of the part parenting may play in that,” Ioannis Katsantonis, co-lead researcher, University of Cambridge, said.
“We are not for a moment suggesting that parents should not set firm boundaries for their children’s behaviour, but it is difficult to justify frequent harsh discipline, given the implications for mental health,” said Katsantonis.
Using data from 7,507 participants in the ‘Growing up in Ireland’ longitudinal study of children and young people, scientists used Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, a standard assessment tool, to capture mental health data.
They gave each child a composite score out of 10 for all their symptoms at ages three, five and nine.Advertisement
They used a second standard assessment to measure the parenting style children experienced at age three.
Parents’ tendencies towards each of three styles were measured – warm parenting (supportive and attentive to their child’s needs); consistent (setting clear expectations and rules); and hostile.
Based on the mental health symptom development trajectories, the study broadly classified the children into three categories.
83.5 per cent of them were at low risk, with low symptom scores at age three, remaining stable or falling thereafter.Advertisement
6.43 per cent of the participants were at mild risk, with high initial symptom scores reducing with time but still being higher than the first group.
The remaining 10.07 per cent were high-risk, with high initial scores that increased by age nine.
Hostile parenting raised a child’s chances of being in the high-risk category by 1.5 times, and the mild-risk category by 1.6 times, by age nine, the researchers found.
Consistent parenting was found to have a limited protective role, but only against children falling into the ‘mild risk’ category.Advertisement
To the researchers’ surprise, however, warm parenting did not increase the likelihood of children being in the low-risk group, possibly due to the influence of other factors on mental health outcomes.

Jennifer Symonds, co-lead researcher and associate professor, UCD, said, “Avoiding a hostile emotional climate at home won’t necessarily prevent poor mental health outcomes from occurring, but it will probably help.”

"If you feel fatigue, frustration, or detachment as a parent, you may be struggling with parental burnoutPremium Story","A few hours after her daughter was born, Sukanya Roy experienced a panic attack. The reason: the hospital she gave birth at had limited facilities and did not allow any family members to be present either — a situation that led to Roy being without any support for hours after delivery. This feeling got triggered once again when she resumed work but was unable to balance parental and work duties. “The organisation had no mechanism for me to do my job and take care of my newborn child at the same time, which led to further stress,” she said, adding that she had to ultimately quit her job to take care of her child.
But, luckily for Roy, there was a silver lining — a support group of mothers on WhatsApp who were facing similar difficulties. “The group, along with counselling, enabled me to find solutions and deal with the burnout,” she said.
Bhawana Narula, who experienced parental burnout in phases, had a similar story to share. “As a first-time mother, there were too many expectations of me. This pushed me over the edge. My entire life started revolving around my daughter,” she said, explaining that it only escalated when she joined back work after her maternity break.Advertisement
But it’s not just women. Vinit Kumar, too, first experienced parental burnout when his wife resumed work from office after maternity leave, while he continued to work from home. “Without the support of any family member, I had to take care of our baby while balancing my work duties. So, initially, I was unable to do justice to my work and was reprimanded by the HR manager of my company,” he said, adding that he started working late in the evening when his baby was asleep to complete his tasks, but this hampered his sleep and increased his stress levels.
What is parental burnout?
Explaining the phenomena, Anna Hema Sam, Clinical Psychologist, Even Healthcare told indianexpress.com, “According to a 2020 research review, parental burnout is a chronic condition resulting from high levels of parenting-related stress due to a mismatch between the demands of parenting and the resources available for them to meet those demands.”
She added that burnout is a gradual progression in which many parents don’t start to realise they are at risk until it starts to take a hold of them. “Since parenting is a lifetime commitment, resigning is not an option. This is why it is so important to recognise the signs of any impending parental burnout and begin to put strategies in place to deal with it before total burnout happens,” Sam said.
Pandemic-fuelled parental burnout

Over the past few years, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, instances of parental burnout have only seemed to have increased. According to a study titled “Examining the Epidemic of Working Parental Burnout and Strategies to Help” published in May 2022, 66 per cent of working parents during the pandemic met the criteria for parental burnout.Advertisement
Highlighting the same, Vishnu Priya Bhagirath, a counselling psychologist said, “Parental burnout is characterised by feelings of fatigue, frustration and detachment from one’s role as a parent. This has escalated due to the pandemic as new challenges have emerged for parents in terms of managing virtual learning, financial strain and increased childcare responsibilities.”
According to Divya Sharma, Chief Learning Officer and Psychologist at MyPeegu, certain factors may increase risk of experiencing parental burnout; these include single parenting, high-demand children who require extra attention or have developmental issues, lack of social support, work-life balance and personal history of mental health problems or trauma.
But parental burnout not only affects parents, it affects kids too. “It is an interlinked eco-system,” said Aruna Agarwal, Founder of Kidzee and Mount Litera Zee School, and a child psychologist, stressing on the fact that when parents are burnt out, kids may end up feeling neglected and can take the wrong steps. They may start skipping their studies and get addicted to longer screen time, and in the internet age, they may even make the wrong friends or face unforeseen situations, they otherwise would not.
Agreed Dr Paramita Mishra, Principal, Orchids International School, Bangalore, and shared that she experienced a “lot of tantrums from my daughter who would refuse to eat food, did not complete school assignments and would befriend people I was opposed to.” But, reprimanding her child made her feel like a “villain”, which is when she realised the need to strike the right balance of “empathy, sacrifice and compassion.”Advertisement
Similarly, what helped Narula was inculcating essential habits in her child such as brushing teeth, organising toys, and doing homework all by herself. “It was difficult initially, but it really helped ease unnecessary pressure and also reduced excessive intervention,” she said.

*Seek support from friends, family members, or mental health professionals

The audacity of being queerPremium Story,"“Can I have a quick word with you before you meet my son?” I heard the worried voice of a father in our waiting room. As I led him to my room, he said, “Our son, Zainab, told us recently he is gay but we know he is not. Can you please talk to him?” I have seen this appeal in so many parents’ eyes and have learned over the years to say with a smile, “Why don’t we all sit together and talk about it?” So that’s what we did and as the adults arranged themselves around the room, Zainab plonked on the chair with, “This is such a waste of time! Why do you have to put me through this?” Finding just the gap I was looking for, I said, “I am sure I would feel the same in your shoes. However, now that we are here and sitting and talking – what are you hoping that we might talk about today and what it might lead to? So that you might later think that it was not such a waste of time?”
Sitting up, Zainab responded, “I want them to not see me as a freak or think I want to be gay because it is fashionable.” In an exasperated voice, Sonia, his mother, asked me, “Isn’t it just a fashion now? I am sure you would agree with me that our children are being influenced by Western ideas and forgetting their sanskar?” Before I could even get a word in, Zainab burst out, “Because people were too scared to talk about it as it was considered illegal until 2018. Your generation (looking at all three of us accusingly) internalised the heteronormative hegemony and silenced and shamed anyone who tried to speak up.” As I tried to gather my thoughts and say something, I heard Salil appeal to his son, “Whatever it is, we want to protect you from a life of misery. You have no idea what you will have to face if you decide to be gay.” Zainab laughed aloud, reminding me how much pain a sound can carry, “But Papa, why don’t you get it? I have not decided to be gay. I am gay.”

As they sat there, speechless in a tangled web of pain and tears, I cleared my throat of the growing lump of pain and said tentatively, “Zainab, what made you share this with your parents and not keep silent?” He hung his head down for a while and I wondered if my question would go unanswered but then he said in a shaky voice, “I have been mustering courage for years to speak to them about it. But I was so scared of their reaction. You should have seen the look on their faces when I told them…they look so repulsed. Papa refused to speak to me for two days and Mumma kept crying all the time, as if I had died.” I asked, “Was that hard for you?” He did not pick up his head but just muttered softly, “Yes, I don’t see what crime I have done for them to react like this. I was just being honest with them, something they have taught me to be.”Advertisement
I was interested to know from the parents whether this tension had led them to say things or do things which were out of character for them or not in keeping with their values. Sonia spoke gently, “Maybe we are not listening to him. We are so scared of society’s reaction.”
I asked her, “Do you have any idea what it took for Zainab to speak up rather than keep quiet despite knowing society’s reaction?” Sonia’s face softened as she glanced at her son and said, “He has always been like this — fearless and doing what he believes is right.” For some time, we heard stories about Zainab and how he stood up to the bullies in his class, feeding his lunch to the street children, questioning a teacher as young as when he was 5 years old as he felt that she was being mean to a classmate.
I was curious to know from Zainab, “What do you want your parents to know that they might be overlooking right now in their pain?” Without looking at them, he answered, “I know they worry about me and it will take them time to accept, but if they can trust me and know that I will be all right. I also want them to know that it is not easy. It is confusing, and it is scary.” Sonia bent her head down and Salil gazed out of the window and then both of them glanced at each other and as if something was agreed upon, though nothing was said.

Therapy is political, we can do more damage by staying silent and not making space for hearing the voices of people who face injustice. If there is one thing I have learned as a therapist it is that people’s conflicts carry complexities. They cannot be seen in binaries of good-bad, fair-unfair, wrong-right. Peace and restoration can only happen when we expose the ruse and align people together against oppression and not against each other. I remembered the words of another young person who had told me, “It’s only in open conversations we find ourselves and each other. It makes us be better and do better.”Advertisement
As we wrapped up, I asked Zainab, “I wonder what it takes to speak up even though it is isolating, confusing and scary?” With a tender smile, Zainab responded, “Audacity.” We exchanged a silent moment of solidarity, an unusual ally-ship. Just as they had left my room, I heard a knock on the door as Salil peeped into the room and my heart dipped with an “uh-oh”. “Do you believe him?” he whispered to me in the same worried tone. I smiled at him and said, “I do and now it is your choice who you want to stand with, your son or society’s idea of sanskar.” He stood for a little while, wrestling with some thoughts and then stepped forward, shook my hand firmly and left.
As I look around the room and reflect on so many stories of so many Zainabs this room has witnessed, I smile to myself. The journey forward for justice might be difficult for them but they will be all right as long as we are ready to walk alongside them as allies – as they claim their right to live the way they want to – with love, honesty and yes, audacity.

Neonate and its first monthPremium Story,"The new mother is anxious and often in postpartum blues. She has access to many different information, hears endless advice and opinions on baby care which can be difficult to handle and often break down. With globalisation there is an instant exposure to information of different practices and the moms are puzzled on what to follow. The family is also excited and wants to do the best practice to raise the baby. The current  age families are nuclear and the new parents are alone and apprehensive in the care of their neonate.
The neonatologist plays a vital role in aiding the mother and family ease in with their neonate. They  help the family to understand and anticipate their baby’s 1 st month journey 
The first 28 days of life is the neonatal period where the babies are highly susceptible to illness if not cared adequately.Advertisement
The important triad of the first month to be ensures in every neonate is 
A. Optimal breast feeding:  Breast milk “Amruth and the first vaccine” to the baby. Establishing breast feeding is the biggest challenge for every 1st time mother. It may not be easy and smooth for every mother and baby. Optimal feeding involves painless feeding with no sore nipple in the mother. Baby during the breastfeed should be comfortable with good sucks and swallow. A well-fed baby will be able to pass more than 6 clear urines in a day and the poop colour changes from black to yellow by day 4-5.
Crucial areas to establish feeds are: 
1.Breast examination of the mother prior to delivery and ensure support to breastfeeding 
2 To identify at risk mothers with nipple concerns like flat inverted nipple and rectify these after birth with nipple accessories such as pullers shield and assistance through lactation consultants’ as soon as possible after birthAdvertisement
3 Start breastfeeding soon after birth. Target 8-10 feeding a day.
4Train family in helping the mother position the latch and support the baby to hold the latch. It’s often seen the family move away from mother during breastfeeding  to ensure privacy ,instead the father and the grandmother  should be taught to assist mother and baby as they will need it in the initial week. This support allows the mother to be at relaxed and fluently breast feed .
4.Allow mother to eat nutritious food and fluids  of her preference with no restrictions. Food restriction or overload  can be stressful for a mother impairing her mood and thereby her milk output.
B.Adequate warmth: Babies need adequate warmth to grow well. Extreme temperature can make them seriously sick. At optimum temperature they are warm and pink. In suboptimal temperature they are blue and cold and in higher temperature they are red hot and sweaty. The above 2 should be avoided. They can be adequately dressed for the above and  be in a room temperature between 25-26 degree Celsius which will also be comfortable for the mother. It is necessary to avoid hot and cold roomsAdvertisement
Conscious hygiene: Newborns have compromised immunity which exponentially improves with months. Hence preventing infection to the newborn in their most vulnerable period is vital. Breastfeeding hand hygiene and avoiding any other oral feeding can prevent infection. The utilities involved in feeding should be cleaned with soap water and sterilized. Fallacies that we see often are rinsing utensils in hot water and not using soap and water in cleaning, introduction of other oral feeds which can be a good source of infection.
Super common question in the first month
1.When can I bathe the baby: Bath is not mandatory in the immediate period, it can be delayed until the cord falls out. Gentle quick sponging with warm water in a warm room can be done from day 2. Bath has to be soothing for the baby, vigorous shaking, head down position, forced massage, pouring water on the face blowing air into the ear nose should be strictly avoided. Preterm baby bath should be initiated only after neonatologist consult
2 How to care for the umblical cord. It is likely to fall off by 2nd week. When kept dry it falls off earlier. Application of antiseptic or antibiotics is not needed routinely. After the fall it may have mild blood spotting for a day or 2 which will settle spontaneously. Consult a doctor if there is persistent blood ooze, pus discharge or redness around the umbilicus.

Should my baby burp after every feed: Not at all, do not wait for burps and disturb their sleep cycle. Babies are frequent feeders and swallow air during feeds and crying. This air will be expelled at its own time. Immediate burping may not happen. The fear of aspiration can be reduced by keeping the baby upright on the caregiver’s chest for a few minutes and then the baby can be made to lie down on their sides rather than their back. 

4.How long should my newborn sleep? Full term babies when fed adequate sleep 14-18 hrs in the first 2 weeks. By the third week until 10th week of life they move into a growth spurt period and demand more frequent feeding. During this period their sleep may reduce to 14 hrs and appear fussier, preferring to be held by caregivers. They settle better with sleep by 3-4 months of age.Advertisement
5.Baby is gassy and cries to pass urine is it normal? Babies tend to swallow more air in their acts of crying and feeding. They are expelled in the form of burps hiccoughs and flatus. This is a very physiological behaviour. Hiccoughs tend to reduce by 6 weeks. Twisting their bodies to pass flatus is also normal as it helps them pass it out in ease. It is usual for the neonate to cry before passing urine in the initial 4 months.

Four ways to support your young adult through depressionPremium Story,"Adolescents and young adults face a host of pressures in life, with so much stress and uncertainty surrounding them. All this makes this age group moody, distant from the family and snappy. It isn’t always easy for parents to distinguish between normal growing-up tantrums and mental health concerns like depression. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in the US, reported in 2021 that more than four in 10 (42 per cent) students felt persistently sad or hopeless and nearly one-third (29 per cent) experienced poor mental health. Depression is a mental health problem that has a big impact on one’s life. It takes away the energy and motivation one needs to get things done. Your love and support during this phase can go a long way to get your young mind back on track.
Everyone goes through certain phases when their mood is low and feel sad, for an hour to a couple of days depending on the situation causing it. But when this persists for a period of two weeks, begins to interfere with daily life and one feels disinterested in things they usually enjoy, it is called Depression.
Not everyone who is depressed experiences the same type and intensity of symptoms. Sometimes people who have depression may even appear absolutely “fine” to loved ones. Know the most common signs in teenagers and young adults when depressed:
Feel like being alone, away from friends and family
Decreased enthusiasm
Academic decline
Absenteeism at School or College
Higher use of alcohol and drugs
Sad
Irritable, Angry and agitated most of the time
Do not feel like doing anything
Unable to concentrate on studies
Higher screen time
How to Support them:Advertisement
Avoid Reinforcing “Depressed” – It’s extremely important to create a distance between your loved one from depression. Depression is an ailment and does not need to become part of their identity, such as “you are depressed”, or “my depressed child”. The symptoms do not define them as a person, it is temporary. Choose your words carefully as they are highly sensitive to negative comments or criticism at this stage.
Compassionate Communication – Have a dialogue with your child on the signs you have noticed and express your concern. Don’t let the fear of their emotional outburst block you from reaching out. They need your love and non-judgmental support more than anything. The most important thing for someone at this stage is to talk. So as a parent, just be willing to listen and focus on acknowledging their feelings, turmoil and problems. Listening attentively will make them feel understood and heard.
Combat isolation – If they spend hours alone in their rooms and devices, they have withdrawn from friends and family. Isolation makes depression worse. So do all you can to connect with them in activities that would engage them for short periods. It could be anything of their interest. Call their close friends or cousins over to spend time together. They will regain their enthusiasm gradually.
Encourage Active movement – Even though the lethargy that sets in the mind and body with depression makes one not feel like moving or getting out of bed. Exercise or dance will give the much-needed adrenaline pump and sweat. Encourage it for even just 10 minutes or do it along with them – it will do a lot of good for your young mind.Advertisement
One needs to understand that no one chooses to have depression. It is an illness that happens due to an unforeseen event, genetics, adverse childhood experiences and sometimes for no obvious singular reason. Depression becomes more damaging when left untreated. The worrisome symptoms will not disappear on its own. You could talk to a psychologist or counsellor, they have the skills to help you and your family through this phase.

Take Time: How to recognise Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and teenagersPremium Story,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic condition that affects millions of children and often continues into adulthood. ADHD includes a combination of persistent problems, such as difficulty sustaining attention, hyperactivity and impulsive behaviour.
Children with ADHD may also struggle with low self-esteem, troubled relationships and poor performance in school. Symptoms sometimes lessen with age. However, some people never completely outgrow their ADHD symptoms. They can, though, learn strategies to be successful.
Signs of ADHD in children
A person may experience difficulties paying attention and staying organised, show excessive fidgeting or restlessness, have trouble with self-control or exhibit impulsive behaviour. In children or toddlers with ADHD, this can lead to symptoms at home, in daycare, or at school. A few observed symptoms include:Advertisement

Trouble focusing on activities and becoming easily distracted
Low attention span while playing or doing schoolwork
Fidgeting, squirming, or otherwise having trouble sitting still
Constantly needing movement or frequently running around
Engaging in activities loudly or disruptively
Excessive talking and interrupting other people
Throwing toys all around and room
Lack of age-appropriate play

Symptoms of ADHD in teenagers
As children with ADHD get older, the symptoms they experience may change. In some cases, certain symptoms seen in childhood may become less problematic in adolescence, while new symptoms can arise amid the changing responsibilities that accompany growing older.
In adolescents and teenagers with ADHD, other symptoms that may appear can include:

Difficulty focusing on schoolwork or other work
Frequently making mistakes while doing work
Trouble finishing tasks, especially schoolwork or chores
Trouble with task organisation and time management
Frequently forgetting things or losing personal items
Frequently avoiding mentally taxing tasks
Experiencing increased frustration and emotional sensitivity
Trouble navigating social and familial relationships
Increased conflict with parents due to ADHD symptoms affecting the home life

It is important to understand that while these symptoms of inattentiveness, hyperactivity, and impulsivity can sometimes cause adolescents and teenagers with this condition to appear “immature,” they are simply a part of ADHD and have nothing to do with a child’s maturity level.
Helping a person with ADHDAdvertisement
ADHD is best diagnosed after age five. Most practitioners do not recommend diagnosis earlier, as it is understood that the child is still growing and certain behavioural changes may be normal and age appropriate.
As it is understood that a few symptoms of ADHD reduce/change during adulthood, there are also certain ways in which an adult suffering from ADHD can benefit better. Certain individuals are able to function adequately over time. However, for some individuals dealing with it without treatment, can be tough. 
Therapy 
Behavioural therapy is one of the most beneficial types of therapy for ADHD, especially for children and adolescents, because it helps identify the thoughts, feelings, and behaviours that have the most impact. In younger children with ADHD, behavioural therapies that focus on parent training, classroom management, and peer interventions are most effective. In adolescents and adults, a type of behavioural therapy called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can also be helpful.
Lifestyle changes
Lifestyle changes for ADHD involve strategies that can help you work through the inattentiveness, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that the condition causes. Here are some helpful ways to create structure for yourself if you have ADHD:Advertisement

Fine tune your study skills
Create organisational techniques
Implement time management strategies
Prepare a timetable to help to organise yourself better

Medication
It can be used alone or in conjunction with therapy to reduce the symptoms of ADHD in both children and adults. The combination of medication and therapy together is said to yield quicker results. Giving or not giving medication is a personal choice, however a large number of patients have seen good results with the same. It is a myth that the medication would become addictive or they would put the person under treatment to sleep. 
Conclusion
ADHD occurs more often in males than in females, and behaviours can be different in boys and girls. Most healthy children are inattentive, hyperactive or impulsive at one time or another. It is typical for preschoolers to have short attention spans and be unable to stick to one activity for long. Even in older children and teenagers, attention span often depends on the level of interest. Seeing only one sign or trait, does not mean that a child has ADHD. It is also essential for parents to rule out the same from a mental health professional and not self-diagnose the same.

Doctor in the House: The environment and your babyPremium Story,"Before you had your baby, you may not have paid too much attention to the state of the environment or wondered how the environment affected your health. But once the baby came along, things changed and you suddenly started taking an interest in the environment. Babies today are exposed to more environmental pollutants than any previous generation in history and they are more susceptible than adults to adverse health effects of these toxins.
There are thousands of chemicals that have been used in commerce since the 1960s and more than half have been used in the production of consumer products and food stuff. Most of them have been invented in the last few years. The scary part is we don’t have much information about these products, much less what it does to our and our children’s bodies.
Why are children more vulnerable to environmental toxins:
— Babies breathe at faster rates than adults, so they take in more air and, hence, are more exposed. Since they are smaller, they are closer to the ground and again this means more exposure.
— Compared to an adult, babies drink more fluid so if water is contaminated, then they take in more toxins.
— For their body weight, babies eat more food.
-Children put all kinds of things in their mouth and absorption from the baby’s gut is more than an adult, so if there is lead in a toy the absorption is more.
— As babies spend more time on the floor crawling and playing, they are more exposed as these particles settle on the floor.
— Exposure of toxins to foetuses, babies and young children can permanently interfere with organ development.Advertisement

Pollutants lurk everywhere. It’s important to know which ones are found more commonly and where, so we can protect our children better.
Food: Antibiotics, additives, hormones, arsenic in rice, methyl mercury
Water: Industrial chemicals, lead from pipes, methyl mercury
Home: Phthalates, bisphenol A, lead, arsenic
Air: Carbon monoxide, second-hand smoke, industrial chemicals, electromagnetic fields
These pollutants have been known to be carcinogens and teratogens that affect the growing foetus; neurotoxins that affect the brain, and endocrine disruptors where they mimic the body’s hormones.
Certain diseases like asthma, leukaemia, male reproductive system problems such as testicular cancer and neuro-developmental problems such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, dyslexia and obesity have been linked to environmental causes.

There are a few ways you can reduce these eco hazards:Advertisement
— Give up smoking
— Run your tap for two minutes in the morning to remove the lead that has stagnated. RO removes toxins and fluoride, but it removes a lot of other minerals that are essential.
— Use less canned food opt for fresh food
— Use steel or glass containers for storing food.
— Do not microwave poly-carbonate plastic food containers as the BPA may break down with repeated use
— Eat six ounces of tuna or large fish per week as they contain more mercury than smaller fish
— Buy fruit and vegetables which are in season, and scrub them well before consuming to try and remove some of the pesticides
— If you have a small garden, try and grow your own greens which will have less pesticides
— Peel the outer leaves of leafy vegetables like lettuce and cabbage
— Peel whatever vegetable you can, though this does remove the fibre
— Don’t do routine pest control at home when you have a baby, do it only when you have pests
— It’s better you set traps for pests like rats
— Limit the time you baby talks or listens on the phone. Try and use hands free
— Keep babies away from small appliances
This list is not to frighten young parents but to create awareness. Poor air quality has a direct link to asthma, and this is more so if there is a genetic susceptibility such as a parent suffering from asthma.

"Covid pandemic had long-lasting impact on teens’ mental health, substance use: Lancet study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a long-lasting impact on the mental health and substance use among adolescents, according to a study published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health journal.
The research is based on survey responses from a nationwide sample of over 64,000 13–18-year-old North American and Icelandic adolescents assessed prior to and up to two years into the pandemic.
Researchers at Columbia University in the US and colleagues had in a 2021 study found an increase in depressive symptoms and decrease in mental well-being among 13–18-year-old adolescents within one year of the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.
A decline in substance use, in particular cigarette smoking, e-cigarette use and alcohol intoxication, was also observed.Advertisement
Expanding on these findings, the new study shows that the negative effect on adolescent mental health persisted up to two years into the pandemic.
“It is worrisome that we still see an increase in mental health problems among adolescents two years into the pandemic. And this is occurring despite social restrictions having been eased in Iceland,” said Thorhildur Halldorsdottir, an assistant professor at Reykjavik University in Iceland, and senior author of the study.
The initial decrease in cigarette smoking and e-cigarette use observed shortly after the arrival of the pandemic was also maintained up to two years into the pandemic, the researchers said.
However, the frequency of adolescent alcohol intoxication appeared to be returning to pre-pandemic levels, they said.
“It is of course positive to see that the reduction in cigarette smoking and vaping has been maintained,” said Ingibjorg Eva Thorisdottir, chief data analyst at Iceland-based research consultancy Planet Youth, and lead author of the study.Advertisement
“We will need to monitor alcohol intoxication among adolescents in years to come, especially given the increase in mental health problems,” Thorisdottir said.
The study also examined the association of immigration status, residency, parental social support and nightly sleep duration with adolescent mental health and substance use.
Parental social support and an average of 8 hours or more of sleep per night was associated with better mental health and less substance use among adolescents, the researchers said.
The relationship between immigration status and residency with adolescent mental health was less clear, they said.Advertisement
These findings suggest that stress exposure, like the COVID-19 pandemic, affects all adolescents to some extent rather than only vulnerable subgroups.

“Policymakers should consider implementing large-scale evidence-based prevention efforts focusing on depressive symptoms to mitigate the negative effect of the pandemic,” said John Allegrante, a professor at Columbia University, and a senior collaborating investigator on the study.

Refractive (Eye) Errors in ChildrenPremium Story,"“Mummy, will I have to start wearing glasses now?”
“Doctor, Can my son overcome eye power through exercises?” 
“Will a good diet improve my daughter’s eye power?”
These are some of the apprehensions I hear on a daily basis when I tell my little patients (and their worried parents) that they have eye power. In medical terms – Refractive Error.
This all begins when the kid returns from school and talks about not being able to read what is displayed on the board during class, especially the ones who are seated in the back benches. Or the child complains of frequent headaches. Even teachers or caretakers sometimes can report children straining themselves to read. There are also cases of parents noticing excessive blinking in their children. These are some of the initial symptoms of refractive error.
First and foremost, it is important to understand that a refractive error is a very common eye disorder. It occurs when the eye cannot clearly focus the images from the outside world. The result of refractive errors is blurred vision, which is sometimes so severe that it causes visual impairment. The most common types include:

Myopia (or short-sightedness) – child is unable to see distant objects clearly.
Hyperopia (or far-sightedness) – in children, hyperopia typically starts from blurring of distant objects and then slowly blurring of objects much closer.
Astigmatism. In very simple terms, blurry vision only at a particular angle of vision.

So, how can this be treated? Short answer – Corrective glasses.
However, the answer is not that simple. The moment glasses are mentioned, parents (and occasionally the kids) tend to go into a state of frenzy and a barrage of questions follow. I have noted some of the most commonly asked questions which I would like to share with you.
Why does my child have eye power?
Various possibilities. Heredity (inherited from one or both parents already having eye power), reduced outdoor activity (or poor exposure to sunlight), increased mobile/laptop/tablet screen time, malnutrition, premature birth etc. Added to that, avid readers tend to be at a higher risk of developing eye power in their younger age.
Do we really need glasses?
Let me answer this with an analogy. What do we do when we feel hungry? We eat food. Staying hungry will only make us feel more hungry and irritable. Similarly, when the eye needs to see clearly, it requires glasses to fulfill its needs. Not wearing or avoiding glasses will strain the eye further and can only lead to a gradual increase in eye power (and the inconveniences that accompany it).
Will the eye power correct itself over time?
It depends. Myopia (or short-sightedness) will not. Whereas Hyperopia (far-sightedness) can reduce or in some cases get corrected completely with time. This is because the eye also grows with age.
Will a good diet combined with regular eye exercises help?
It will certainly help. A good diet is essential for the overall development of the child and not just the eyes. Similarly, eye exercises can help strengthen the eye muscles in certain conditions. But neither diet nor eye exercises can replace necessary treatment.
Post the Corona pandemic, there has been a substantial increase in the number of cases of refractive errors in children. This can be primarily attributed to increase in screen time – either due to online classes or for leisurely activities since it was not always possible to venture out, meet friends offline or play outdoors. While refractive error in children is a very common disorder, identifying the condition early and getting it treated makes a world of difference to a child’s quality of life.
Simple measures such as limiting screen time, spending time outdoors with good exposure to sunlight, especially in the mornings, ensuring a well-lit environment for reading and taking regular breaks to rest the eyes will go a long way in keeping the eye healthy. In the meantime, for the little ones who may still be apprehensive of wearing glasses due to cosmetic reasons and are looking for that magic wand to cure eye power. Remember, our beloved and brave wizard Harry Potter always wore glasses.

What makes artist Amar Kanwar’s Such a Morning essential viewingPremium Story,"Artwork: Such a Morning
Artist: Amar Kanwar
Where can it be viewed: At Kochi-Muziris Biennale in Fort Kochi till April 10
Why?
Arguably one of the world’s most politically discerning artists, through his works Amar Kanwar compels viewers to build their own perceptions. Layered with archival material, interviews, poetry, prose and animated drawings, his well-researched multi-channel installations and videos comment on political and societal issues through an interrogative lens, offering varied perspectives and pleaing justice.
Screened in 2017 at Documenta — a prestigious film festival in Germany — Such a Morning is a cinematic parable about the limits of knowledge, and addresses global political tensions, violence and insecurities. The 85-minute film has as its protagonist an ageing mathematics professor who decides to leave his university position and live in an abandoned railway carriage in the deep forests in anticipation of the onset of blindness. Not convinced, his colleagues are curious.Advertisement
“The film searches for a sensory, hallucinatory and metaphysical way to re-comprehend the difficult times we are living in and the very meaning of truth, rather than presenting an argument,” stated Kanwar in an interview to The Indian Express in 2018. The post-graduate from Mass Communication Research Centre at Jamia Millia Islamia, was still pursuing his Master’s when he made Site and A Wager (1986), a film that discussed minimum wages, health and maternity benefits in India.
While there are no dialogues in Such a Morning, the silence is meant to speak and the arresting visuals are riveting. At the end of the film, the artist-filmmaker presents “a set of clues that may help to live, re-calibrate, respond and resist”, suggesting the presence of light at the end of the tunnel. At a larger level, through the work Kanwar raises concerns over the present dark times, and the possibilities of dealing with it.

Awarded the Prince Claus Award (2018) and Golden Gate Award, San Francisco International Film Festival (1999) among other accolades, Kanwar is one of India’s most well-known artists who has exhibited at the world’s most prestigious venues.

Water Birth: The natural way of birthingPremium Story,"On 6th March, BirthRight by Rainbow Hospitals did its first under water delivery at its hospital in B.G. Road, Bengaluru, under the supervision of Dr Shailaja, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynecologist.
A variety of birthing options are available today. Depending on the parent’s preference, mothers and baby’s health, the mother may choose to deliver in the hospital or a birth centre. Delivery process is so unpredictable, nobody can anticipate any complication accurately. So, if the Natural Birthing Unit is part of the Hospital with all facilities, the mother and baby will be safer and also it will boost up the mother’s confidence and morale.
In this case, the mother was pregnant for the second time with previous vaginal conventional delivery. The baby’s weight was 3.33kg. She was submerged in water when she started having labor pain. Within 1½ hours she successfully delivered a baby boy under water with less pain. We did not cut the perineum, the baby came out on its own and came to the surface. Mother, herself supported. Baby cried as soon as it reached earth side. Mother fed the baby even before the placenta was separated. She had a small perineal tear, which was sutured under local anaesthesia on the labor cot. Blood loss was very minimal. The whole family including her first baby rejoiced at the birth. 
Water births have become more popular over the last several decades. American College and Obstetricians and Gynecologists recognize certain benefits. Immersion in water may help shorten the duration of labor. Laboring in water also decreases her need for epidurals or other spinal pain relief. This reduces caesarean section rate by 50%. Also it has been shown to cause less urinary stress incontinence problems for mothers. Mothers will have higher birth satisfaction. The warmth of water and the weightlessness give mothers room to escape without disconnecting. They treasure the moment, the gentle start they give for their babies. They themselves bring their baby unto their chest from still water.
One thing is important, mothers should be careful while choosing water births. Water births may not be recommended for women who have unfavourable factors for vaginal delivery. While rare, babies born in water may acquire infections. Other risks include trouble regulating baby’s body temperature, chance of umbilical cord damage, respiratory distress for baby, asphyxia and seizures. To avoid these we use a birth pool liner, sterilize tubs, continuously monitor water temperature, baby heart rate at regular intervals and progress labor. We play soothing music to keep mother calm. We should be well equipped and prepared for any unpredictable eventualities. Parents always have to communicate their desires to have a water birth with a healthcare provider to discuss their individual risks and birth plan.

‘Maths anxiety’ is a real thing. Here are 3 ways to help your child copePremium Story,"From March 15, more than one million young Australians will sit the NAPLAN numeracy test. For most students, this will just be a routine part of the school day (albeit less fun than running around at recess or lunch).
But for others, the prospect of doing a maths test will be downright terrifying. These students may be suffering from maths anxiety. We are academics in mathematics education. Here’s how to help your child if they are experiencing maths anxiety.
What is maths anxiety?
Maths anxiety is the feeling of tension and worry that interferes with a person’s ability to solve mathematical problems. Researchers consider maths anxiety to be distinct from general anxiety, or test anxiety, though there is some crossover.Advertisement
Maths anxiety usually develops as a result of poor experiences with maths, which leads to negative thought patterns about your maths potential. These thoughts can manifest in an avoidance of maths and feelings of helplessness when confronted with tests.
Maths anxiety is a common issue for many young people and adults and can be seen in children as young as five.
According to Stanford University mathematics education professor Jo Boaler, as of 2012, up to 50% of adults had maths anxiety. The Victorian Department of Education suggests rates are lower, at between six and 17%. However, the average rate in academic studies tends to be approximately 20%.
That means there are thousands of children who will be dreading the upcoming NAPLAN numeracy test.
So, what can a parent do to help their anxious child achieve their best in the NAPLAN numeracy test and other maths exams?Advertisement
Here are three practical things you can do right away and into the future:
1. Focus on successes to build confidence 
Most children want to be good at maths. If they are younger, they will likely understand this is something their teachers and parents think is important. If they are older, they will know it is important for future jobs and careers.
One of the key sources of maths anxiety is despite wanting to be good at maths, students have received consistently negative feedback about their ability. This may just be by comparing themselves to others or more formally through poor results.
To reduce anxiety, it is important to focus on the positive, showing your child times where they have had success in maths. Experiences of success are vital in paving the way to further success in maths.Advertisement
A practical way to demonstrate success is by getting the child to do an old worksheet, even as far back as two years ago. Students in years 5 and above could do a previous NAPLAN test at a lower level. This shows them how they have progressed.
After completing the sheet, focus on areas of strength – such as “you got all the long divisions correct!” – to help build confidence. This experience of success can be used as a base to then tackle more complicated tasks.
2. Avoid ‘NAPLAN overload’
Anxiety about NAPLAN and any other assessments can be exacerbated by over-emphasising its importance in the buildup. A more constructive approach is to reassure your child there is no judgement in how they perform.
Currently, most schools are working hard to prepare students for NAPLAN and discussions about the test are regularly taking place. Because of this, it can be easy for children with maths anxiety to get “NAPLAN overload”. At home, it is useful to limit your discussion of the upcoming tests to times where the child is doing work to prepare for it.Advertisement
We recommend trying to make the day an exciting one, rather than a terrifying one. For example, you might have a special NAPLAN breakfast on the day of the test.
3. Work alongside your child
During COVID many families felt the strain taking a hands-on role with their children’s education (who did not take kindly to mum or dad suddenly becoming their “teacher”). So parents may be tempted to leave their children alone to study or do homework. But this won’t help relieve maths anxiety.
A more beneficial approach is for parents to study alongside younger children and show interest in the work older children are completing. Teenagers may not be open to help when you offer the first time but make it clear that you’re there if they need you and you aren’t seeking to judge them.
This approach shows the child their parent is engaged with their work and positive about their ability to learn.Advertisement
It cannot be underestimated how much a parents’ approach to learning maths influences their child’s approach. Try and have positive conversations with your child about maths and how we use it every day. This can be help dispel negative attitudes, such as children thinking, “this is too hard and is just something I need to do at school”. You might want to use maths to work through a “best buy” at the supermarket or use length and area to determine how to arrange the furniture in a room.

As the test day nears, families should not have to stress out about NAPLAN. Preparation focused on celebrating successes and positive experiences can encourage students to simply do their best.

The number one skill to inculcate in your children to make them achieversPremium Story,"“I decided to study for four hours today, but I could not. I was engrossed in gaming”
 “I decided to wake up at 5am to practise, but I overslept and couldn’t wake up.”
 “The heats practise is too strenuous, I can’t focus on it for so long.”Advertisement
Do these sound familiar to you? Today’s teenagers and young adults commonly make these statements, even adults do! Often, most parents take it upon themselves to be drivers of their children’s activities, behaviour and actions, be it going to tuition on time or studying diligently and setting limits on what they can and cannot do. It’s exhausting and frustrating for any parent who needs to do this 24/7! And naturally, it disturbs the bonding at home.
By inculcating self-discipline, you can tap into your adolescent’s inner potential with more power. Self-discipline is the ability to control yourself, put in the effort and behave in a specific way without requiring anyone else to tell you what to do. They will learn to make responsible decisions in your absence. They will have the gateway to develop healthy habits and mental strength.
Self-discipline requires patience, time and careful handling. Here are guidelines to inculcate this invaluable trait into your children, no matter what age they are at:
Teach self-control
Self-control is the key to achieving self-discipline, as it makes a person tolerate discomfort. There is a famous experiment by Austrian-American psychologist Walter Mischel called the Stanford marshmallow test. In this, a child is offered a choice between one small and immediate reward or two small rewards if they wait for a certain amount of time. The study found that children who waited and exercised self-control performed better over the years. As a parent, you can indulge in similar activities to teach your teenagers self-control, with a delayed reward promised.
Decide on an achievable goal togetherAdvertisement
Being motivated towards something they want to achieve is crucial during this process. It could be reading a story book in seven days, netting the ball from a certain angle in basketball or increasing their math scores by 15 per cent. Let them choose freely. Set a timeline for this.
Create a Routine
Together, create a plan to achieve a regime. Discuss any perceived hurdles and difficulties and how to overcome them. Talk about areas where they may need to set limits on themselves, so they are able to exercise self-control to achieve their goal.
Reward self-control and their efforts
Praise, appreciation and rewards are essential building blocks for teaching this discipline. If they spent extra time in practise, appreciate the conscientious decision made. If they decide to not visit a friend because of their goal-plan, praise them. Praise the effort they are putting into achieving their goal. At this stage, decide what the reward will be.
Be an accountable parent-partner
Having an encouraging partner who can cheer for you on the good days and be watchful when you go off track, can make a world of difference. Lend them a patient ear when they’re beating themselves up for something they couldn’t do. Find ways to solve it together. This partnership also includes role modelling similar behaviour for yourself. Using any harsh words and punishments will be detrimental during this time.Advertisement
Practising self-discipline requires time and effort. It’s important to harness it from a young age as it paves the path to adulthood. Even in the absence of parents and adults, one can think and act responsibly. Self-discipline gives a human being mental and inner strength to be successful and overcome obstacles that life throws. Follow the guidelines and you will be on your way to soaring levels of self-discipline in your family.

Curious Kids: why don’t grown-ups play like kids?Premium Story,"Why don’t grownups play like us kids do? Annie, aged 7, Canberra. Hi Annie, this is such a clever question.
What led you to ask this? Did you notice this at a playground, where kids seem to do all the playing – the climbing, swinging and sliding, while grown-ups just hang around, pushing swings or texting on their phones? In fact, most grown-ups don’t play in playgrounds, which is weird because playgrounds are so much fun.
Play is so important, but why?
Most kids are experts at play. This is because play is one of the best ways to learn about yourself and the world around you.
Play helps you move better, think better, imagine, solve problems and play with others.Advertisement
This leads back to your great question. If play is so good for us and so fun, why don’t grown-ups play like kids? There are lots of answers, but I will share two of the big ones.
Grown-ups have a lot to take care of
First, grown-ups have to pay for lots of things, like food, transport and somewhere to live. This means they have to go to work to earn money. And if they have kids, they have to look after them.
So grown-up life can be stressful and busy. And one thing about play is they have to feel like playing to have fun. If grown-ups are tired or have too much serious stuff on their minds, it makes it hard to feel like playing.
Yet, grown-ups need to play too, and for many of the same reasons as kids. But grown-ups also need to play to let go of stress and worry.
Grown-ups play too
So – and this is the second answer to your awesome question – adults have found grown-up ways to play. This gets them moving, thinking and problem solving, while also hanging out with others.Advertisement
Once they can no longer squeeze onto the slide or swing at the park, grown-ups may take up a hobby like sewing or skydiving. They might also like playing games with friends, like sport or board games. They can even play with their friends online with a computer or phone.
In fact, grown-ups like playing so much they have games and parties where they dress up and play with lots of other grown-ups. Older grown-ups also have their own playgrounds.
ALSO READ | Curious Kids: How does DNA affect our fingerprints and eye colour?
So, the answer to your question is adults don’t always play like kids do because they can be busy and have lots of other things to do. But they do actually play, even if that’s sometimes in a different way.
Keep playing and being curious Annie.

Doctor in the House: How to understand if your child has Autism Spectrum DisordersPremium Story,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a group of conditions related to brain development and it mainly impacts how a person perceives and socialises with others. This causes problems in social interaction and communication. Some children show repetitive behaviour. Many children with ASD can have delayed or absence of language development, intellectual disabilities, poor motor coordination and attention weaknesses.
ASD consists of a spectrum of disorders such as:
– Autistic disorder
– Pervasive Developmental Disorder-not otherwise specified
– Asperger syndrome
People with ASD have trouble with social interactions and with interpreting and using nonverbal and verbal communication in social context:
– Inflexible interests
-They insist on routine and sameness of environment
-Repetitive motor and sensory behaviours like flapping arms or rocking
– Increased or decreased reactions to sensory stimuliAdvertisement
Since there is such a huge spectrum of symptoms, how a person with ASD functions in daily life depends on the severity of symptoms.
Usually, the behavioural signs surface between age 1.5 years and 3 years. Occasionally, children may appear to develop normally in the first year of life but then start to show signs of regression between 18 months and 2 years of age.
Causes
Currently, there is no known cause for Autism, though some studies point to genetic and environmental factors. Other risk factors include parental age, low birth weight, prematurity and maternal use of drugs such as thalidomide or valproic acid.
 There was an initial report linking vaccines like MMR to ASD but many further studies have not found any correlation between vaccination and ASD. (Pic source: Pixabay)
When one child has been diagnosed with ASD, the next child has a 20 per cent chance of developing ASD. If the first two children have ASD, the third child has a higher chance of developing ASD (32 %).Advertisement
There was an initial report linking vaccines like MMR to ASD but many further studies have not found any correlation between vaccination and ASD.
Signs of ASD
There are a diffuse spectrum of signs ranging from mild to severe. Following are some of the signs that could indicate your child falling into the spectrum for autism.
– Your child does not respond to his name when he or she is called or responds inconsistently.
– The baby at six months does not smile widely or gurgle or has a joyous expression when interacting with mother.Advertisement
– Baby does not smile or make faces with you or strangers, nor does he or she make eye contact.
– Does not babble by the time he or she is a year old.
– No pointing or waving or back and forth gestures by one year of age.
– No meaningful words or simple phrases by two years of age. Repeats words and phrases verbatim, but does not understand how to use them.Advertisement
– Any loss of speech or social skills at any age.
– Does not express emotions or feelings and appears unaware of others’ feelings
– In a social interaction, has inappropriate responses like being passive or aggressive .
– Has difficulty recognising nonverbal clues, such as interpreting other people’s facial expressions, body postures or tone of voice.Advertisement
Most of these children have certain repeated patterns of behaviour or activities. These include:
– Repetitive movements like spinning, flapping and rocking
– Performs activities that could cause self-harm like head banging
– Develops specific routines and gets disturbed when there is a change
– Is fascinated by details of an object like wheels of a car
– Unusually sensitive to light, sound or touch, yet may be indifferent to pain
– Fixates on an object or activity with abnormal intensity.Advertisement
– Specific food preferences, such as eating only a few food, and refusing foods with certain textures.
How to make the diagnosis?
Unfortunately, there are no tests to diagnose ASD. If you suspect that your baby may have a few of the above signs then speak to your paediatrician. He or she may refer to a child development specialist or child psychologist who has been specially trained to diagnose ASD. The child will need a lengthy examination to come to a conclusion.
Treatment
Once a diagnosis is made, this is usually a life-long condition. Most of the children will benefit from therapies that will teach the child new skills and address the core deficits and thereby reduce the core symptoms of autism. The treatment should be tailored to each child as the symptoms will vary with each child. The earlier the diagnosis is made the better as the therapies can be started early. Sometimes these interventions are needed lifelong.
Some children may have other problems which may be in the form of seizures or gastrointestinal problems which will need attention too. The treatment of these conditions can go on side by side.Advertisement
Initially, the treatments may be intensive and may involve many professionals like occupational therapists and speech therapists but as they get older it can be more tailored and less frequent to tackle day-to-day problems.
As they get older, therapies and interventions should be aimed at acquiring life skills and possible employment in the future.
For many children, the symptoms get less severe as the child gets older. The treatment will need adjustment as they get older. Most children have a normal life span but may need some form of therapy and the needs depend on the severity of symptoms.

Neutral maternal behaviour linked with epigenetic changes in children: Study,"Neutral maternal behaviour towards their infants has been linked with an epigenetic change related to stress response in children, according to a new study which added evidence to the importance of early development.
Epigenetics are molecular processes independent of DNA that influence gene behaviour.
In this study, researchers found that neutral or awkward behaviour of mothers with their babies at 12 months correlated with an epigenetic change called methylation, or the addition of methane and carbon molecules, on a gene called NR3C1 when the children were 7 years old.
This gene has been associated with regulating the body’s response to stress, the study said.Advertisement
“There is evidence of a relationship between the quality of maternal-infant interaction and methylation of this gene though these are small effects in response to a relatively small variation in interaction,” said Elizabeth Holdsworth, a Washington State University biological anthropologist and lead author of the study.
The study is published in the American Journal of Human Biology.
Other studies have connected extreme stress in early life, like neglect and abuse, to more dramatic methylation on this particular gene in adults.
 “There is evidence of a relationship between the quality of maternal-infant interaction and methylation of this gene though these are small effects in response to a relatively small variation in interaction” (Pic source: Pexels)
However, Holdsworth emphasized that the small difference indicated by this study may be an indication of normal human variation and it is hard to determine if there are any long-term effects.Advertisement

For this study, Holdsworth and her co-authors analyzed a subsample of 114 mother-infant pairs from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a project that tracks a cohort of children born in 1991 and 1992 in Avon, UK.
The researchers first analyzed data from an observational study of the mothers sharing a picture book with their children at 12 months, in which their interactions were coded on warmth.
The study focused on mothers because they are often infants’ primary caregivers. The vast majority of the women in this sample were white, college-educated and from middle-income households, it said.
The range of warmth they displayed only varied slightly with the “coldest” behaviour classified as awkward or neutral, but this is exactly what the researchers hoped to test: that if even small differences in social interaction could be linked to an epigenetic change, the study said.Advertisement
The observed behaviour was then compared against data from an epigenetic analysis of the children’s blood samples taken at age seven, the study said.
The researchers found that the mothers showing awkward or neutral behaviour toward their infant correlated with a small increase of methylation on the NR3C1 gene, the study said.
This gene encodes a receptor involved in the regulation of the HPA axis – the interaction between the body’s hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenal glands. This axis plays a role in stress response, including production of the body’s primary “stress” hormone, cortisol.
The HPA axis can be activated by almost anything that requires a quick release of energy from reacting to a real threat to watching a scary movie to simply exercising.Advertisement
The NR3C1 gene is known to be involved in activating this axis, but more research is needed to understand how methylation of that gene is associated with stress response, Holdsworth said, as some studies have shown increased methylation linked to hypo-reactivity, or blunted response while others have shown hyper-reactivity.
Researchers are working to uncover how these changes happen, particularly during infancy when the body is developing rapidly, as well as what they might mean, they said.

How mindfulness can help us address our feelings of exhaustion and burnoutPremium Story,"“I am so burnt out!” This is a sentiment echoed in so many conversations across various urban spaces, be it high school and college students, young workers, teachers, people in the corporate as well as the NGO sector and even the custodians of our mental health – therapists, counsellors and psychiatrists. People are talking about being “exhausted,” “overwhelmed,” and, as one person put it, “every day is like a Sisyphean task to endure and start again.”
As there is such an inevitable connection between burnout and mental health, I have always been intrigued by the way it has shown up over the last three decades in my journey as a therapist. There were three ingredients that seemed to be closely tied to the churn of it – the productivity trap of excessive work, work not being aligned with what we value and hardships in our personal lives that eroded our energy to work. However, in the past seven years, that peaked during the pandemic, I started noticing a big shift. I started hearing people feeling depleted despite loving the work they were doing.
This experience has been described by people in so many fascinating images – “squirrel brain”, “walking around with a dripping tank mind” and the “beehive brain”. They really encapsulate the churn that our minds experience on a day-to-day basis. Now, what is happening to our brains that is inviting such a stirring?Advertisement
Digital lure: Imagine if a child was trying to read inside the world’s biggest free candy store. Chances are high that the lure of the candy would outweigh any interest in reading. Especially if the candy was free and multiple billion dollars were going into making it so deliciously attractive. I am taking a child’s example here but an adult brain is not in any way different in resisting this enticement because that is what the internet candy store is doing to us, isn’t it? With all the dings of pleasure through endless scrolling of Instagram reels, YouTube videos, Netflix shows – the candies are laid out to us and who among us can resist the endless delights they promise?
Attention theft: “But it is surely harmless”, you might say, “what is wrong with some fun?” I am no Luddite and I enjoy my time at this candy store and end up overstaying and enjoying its guilty pleasures more than I would like to admit. But I am very much aware of the insidious way it is stealing my precious time. Time I could have done things that I really cherish – spending time with my family, reading, writing, thinking, ideating, being in nature and so much more. But no, I spent that time checking emails I wish I did not get, meaningless WhatsApp messages or just doing random internet searches under the pretext of research. Commenting on the snares of multitasking, a young person shared, “At the end of the rabbit hole is just shame of not having done anything I set out to do. It is a Kafkaesque nightmare!”
Cost of cognitive shifts: Another question you might ask is, “We get how it robs us of our time, focus and attention but how is this related to burnout?” Well, if in a day I am spending hours checking emails and WhatsApp messages, where does it leave time for me to do what really matters to me? Not only that, every time I am moving from my writing to opening my inbox or dipping into Google, there is a cognitive cost to it. Let me explain with an example: suppose you are working on a whiteboard, putting your wonderful ideas down with clarity and the lure of the internet candy got you to take a quick peek at your Instagram page. Let’s slow the process down and see what happens.
Your brain is on focus mode – thinking, reflecting, buzzing with ideas. As soon as you peek into Instagram, you lose your train of thought and you see a disturbing post on some latest news of violence. You might close the Instagram instantly but the brain has already been  highjacked and carries the residue of the disturbing picture. You turn to the whiteboard but it does not make sense any more. It is as if somebody has erased most of your ideas away and you have to start all over again. Now, what if it happened throughout the day as your quick peeks into the candy jars left you more and more fatigued? Very much like walking through the day with what my friend called the “dripping tank mind”. We are walking around with our minds leaking and wondering why we are more depleted than ever.Advertisement
Recently, I tried a little experiment and also started checking with many people I met on what they were doing to resist the ‘dripping tank”:
Digital breaks: So my little experiment — recently when I was on a family holiday, I went off gadgets for a week – no WhatsApp, emails, internet – nothing. After the initial twitchiness ( imagine resisting whipping out your phone every time you see something spectacular), it left me feeling refreshed and liberated. I did all things that I held precious — read a pile of books, wrote, reflected, went for long walks, had meaningful conversations and let myself experience “being” without the pressure of living in a hyper alert state. A lot of people have shared with me how they take digital breaks during weekends, after work or only have access to their gadgets at slotted times as a way to stop their tank leaking.
Intentional use: What gives you a sense of joy, brings value to your life and makes you more creative? If there is an app that helps you do that, then choose it intentionally. I know of artists, designers and photographers who earn their living by showcasing their work on Instagram. But they do it very intentionally – they delete it after posting and then reinstall next time they have to use it. They are using social media rather than letting it use them.

Ethical digital culture: We cannot expect Google, Facebook etc to start becoming concerned about the impact of the digital overload on us and taking active steps to stay accountable. The profits are too huge and their power is immense. But maybe we could take small micro-steps in our lives to bring about a change. Imagine if schools and colleges started a curriculum demystifying the operations of power — who is benefitting, the impact on our lives and having conversations on the intentional and ethical use of gadgets, thereby inviting a higher sense of agency and making space for informed decisions. Imagine if workspaces transformed the reactive “beehive” culture and did not equate the buzz of relentless emails, slack channels and messages as metrics of efficiency or productivity. Life is the sum total of what we pay attention to. Imagine being able to step out of this techno-sucking spiral and stepping into a life where we can engage more joyfully, live more meaningfully and work more deeply.Advertisement

Four ways parents can support their child going through board exam stressPremium Story,"Board exams become quite a family affair. It almost feels like it’s the parents giving their board exams again – they feel the same amount of stress and anxiety, if not more! Parents often tell me with pride and a sense of sacrifice that “we have removed the TV from the house for one year” or “we have given up Sunday family outings for six months” – all this to ensure that their board-exam-appearing teenager is not distracted.
Do you need to alter your life to such an extent to support them? As parents, you do what is best for your child, but do consider that this would make you have higher performance expectations and create unnecessary pressure on the young mind. All this creates a tense environment in the house, and they find it harder to focus on their academics. Your children require parents who are upbeat around them and to pay attention to their needs. Keep the atmosphere at home happy and positive.
Stress is not all bad, quite on the contrary, it increases productivity, drives action towards goals and improves focus. But beyond a certain level of stress, all of this stops and it creates the opposite effect. It can lead to reduced concentration, forgetfulness and negatively impacts efficiency.Advertisement
Competition in the present time is very tough. When a son or daughter of the family does not score good marks in their board exam, people often assume callousness on the parent’s part or blame the child for not working hard. It’s no longer only their performance and capability, it has somehow come to represent the home environment. The additional societal expectations for high results and comparison with others, can take one into a deeper, dark hole.
The more you know, the better you will understand and handle your child with care.
Here are some ways parents can help a teen ease out the stress and pressure and more importantly to prevent a tragedy.
Know the Signs of Stress:
Cognitive
*Negative thoughts
*Difficulty in memorising and recall
*Difficulty in making decisions
*Confusion
*Lack of concentration
*Increase in self-doubt
*Forgetful
Emotional
*Irritable
*Over-burdened
*Anxious, nervous or afraid
*Moody and hypersensitive
*Anger
Behavioural
*Aggressive
*Snapping at people
*Biting nails, picking at skin
*Restless, like you can’t sit still
*Feeling tearful or crying
*Staying isolated
*Increased smoking, alcohol and drug use
*Self-harm
Physical
*Sleep disturbance
*Tired all the time
*Headaches
*Change in appetite
Reach Out 
Be vigilant and observant to any changes in behaviour or signs mentioned above. If you notice your teen not looking and behaving like his/her normal self, sit and say, “You seem worried/withdrawn. Would you like to talk about it? Maybe I can help.” Wait for them to respond. Let them know you’re there for them. Reassure them. Encourage them.
Support & Care Advertisement
Offer care, love and support unconditionally. Listen to understand them. If you feel your child is feeling pressured by you or a family member, remove the pressure, as their mental health and life is too precious for that.
Encourage study breaks 
Parents and young teenagers tend to fixate on studying only during this time. But taking short breaks boosts concentration when they return to the studies at hand. So, encourage them to relax and incorporate breaks into their study schedule.

Stress can affect a person in so many ways, but when it affects daily functioning it’s an alarm that needs to be addressed immediately. The longer any person continues to experience high levels of stress, it will affect more areas of their life as well as their physical health. Exam stress is serious. A mental health professional can help your teen concentrate better, resolve any emotional burdens, with tools to keep him/her motivated and boost confidence. They could also guide you on what you should do to alleviate the distress that you or your young one is facing.

Curious Kids: How does DNA affect our fingerprints and eye colour?Premium Story,"Solving crimes in real life is not quite like it is on television, but in both settings, evidence is required. Fingerprints and DNA left at a crime scene are both excellent sources of evidence.
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has some influence on our fingertips, but what really makes fingerprints unique is the special folding pattern of tiny ridges on our skin. This occurs during fetal development and gives humans the ability to hold and grip objects. No two patterns of ridges are exactly alike.
DNA fingerprinting, on the other hand, is another way of collecting evidence that enables investigators to narrow down the identity of an individual based on unique genetic patterns.Advertisement
A set of instructions
DNA is the genetic information contained inside each of our cells that makes us who we are. DNA acts like a set of instructions written in a special code using just four letters: A-adenine, T-thymine, C-cytosine, and G-guanine. These letters refer to nucleotides, and it is the specific order of nucleotides within DNA that represents the instructions for all the cells and their functions in our body.
The complete set of DNA instructions is 99.9 per cent similar across every single human on the planet — but the tiny fraction that is different is as unique as the prints on the tips of your fingers.
These unique regions occur at known positions in our DNA in small sections called microsatellites, or tandem repeats. Microsatellites contain short segments of repeating DNA that are typically one to six nucleotides long (for example, GATGATGAT). Everyone has the same microsatellites in the same known positions in our DNA, however, the number of repeats varies from person to person.
 Using FDP, investigators can determine an individual’s age, ancestry, hair colour, skin colour and eye colour. (Pic source: Pixabay)
You may have “GAT” repeated 10 times, whereas your teacher may have “GAT” repeating 12 times. As a result of these differences in the number of repeats, microsatellites have easily measurable lengths and investigators can use these measurements to generate a match between a suspect’s DNA and a crime scene sample.Advertisement
Determining appearance from DNA
DNA fingerprinting may not always produce a match, or investigators may not have any suspects to compare crime scene DNA to. So how do investigators know who to look for?
New methods are using DNA left at a crime scene to teach us about what a suspect looks like.
It might sound like science fiction, but a new technique called forensic DNA phenotyping (FDP) can help generate a suspect profile from the genetic material left at a crime scene.
Using FDP, investigators can determine an individual’s age, ancestry, hair colour, skin colour and eye colour.Advertisement
ALSO READ | New system can identity people from their DNA in minutes
Let’s use eye colour as an example. The colour of your eyes is dependent on how much eumelanin you have in the iris. Eumelanin is a dark brownish-black pigment, and it absorbs a large amount of light. Individuals who have a lot of eumelanin in their irises have eye colours that appear dark, such as brown.
There are several genes responsible for controlling eumelanin production in the eye, but one of the most important genes for eye colour is called OCA2, located on chromosome 15.
Here is where our DNA instruction book comes in handy again. At any given position in our DNA sequence, we have two nucleotides, one on the chromosome inherited from our mother and one on the chromosome from our father. Individuals with two copies of “G” at a specific position near OCA2 (inheriting one “G” from their mother and another “G” from their father) produce less eumelanin and are more likely to have blue eyes.
In contrast, individuals with one or two copies of an “A” at the same position produce more eumelanin and are more likely to have brown eyes. Researchers are working to improveAdvertisement
FDP technology every day, as individuals with intermediate eye colours such as green and hazel are very hard to determine.

However, the ability to determine if crime scene DNA came from an individual with blue or brown eyes might be the information an investigator needs to narrow down a group of suspects.

Doctor in the House: Common orthopaedic problems among infants and young childrenPremium Story,"Most young kids may go through a phase in their growing years where they may have any of the conditions described below, but will grow out of them without any intervention. This includes flat feet, knock knees, bow legs, pigeon toes or toe walking. There are other more serious orthopaedic problems like Developmental Dysplasia of the hip or talipes equinovarus earlier known as “club foot” which need to be treated promptly to get good results.
Let’s look at a few of these conditions:
Flat feet or pes planus
Flat feet or pes planus is exactly as the name suggests — the feet are flatter on the bottom and allow the whole sole to touch the floor when the baby is standing. They are normal in babies and toddlers because the arches in the foot are not developed.
The arches develop through childhood but many individuals don’t develop arches in their feet. It’s quite commonly seen and tends to run in families. They don’t cause any problems and don’t need any specific treatment. However, if there is pain, then they need to be seen by an orthopaedic doctor. They may be recommended some arch supports or stretching exercises or even special shoes. Again, these are only needed if there is pain and discomfort.
Bow legs or genu varusAdvertisement
This is when the leg curves outward at the knee when both the ankles and foot touch. Infants and toddlers often have bow legs. This self-corrects by three to four years. They usually don’t bother the child, are not associated with pain or discomfort and don’t affect the child’s ability to walk or run.
ALSO READ | Doctor in the House: Here’s why your child could benefit from the flu vaccine
Sometimes, these children may walk with their toes pointed inward called in-toeing or pigeon toes. This usually resolves on its own. When babies are born with slightly curved or bow legs it is usually because some of the bones had to rotate slightly when they were growing in the womb to fit in the tight space. When children initially start walking, it may appear to get worse before it starts to improve. Children who start to walk at a younger age tend to have more noticeable bowing. They tend to correct by the time the child is four years of age.
Rarely, it may be due to more serious problems like rickets, where there is a deficiency of vitamin D or a growth disorder of the bone called BLOUNT disease. An equally rare cause may be infections involving that area or tumours.
In certain situations where it is not straightening or if bowing is asymmetrical or if the child is in pain or limping, then a specialist opinion may be sought.Advertisement
These may need treatment with brace or surgery in Blount disease or vitamin D supplementation in rickets. Physiological bowing does not need treatment.
Knock knees or genu valgum
Knock knees refers to a condition wherein when the child is standing, the knees touch but the ankles and feet remain apart. Knock knees often happen as normal part of growth and development in children. It’s rarely serious and straightens by seven to eight years.
 In rare cases, children with severe or rigid club foot may need more extensive surgery (Source: Getty Images/Representational)
Parents usually notice this and are worried that the child will trip and fall. This is part of normal growth but, in rare cases, it may be because of vitamin D deficiency or a fracture involving the growth plate of one of the bones of the knee joint.
Sometimes, being overweight can lead to knock knees or tumours involving the knee joint.Advertisement
Most children don’t need treatment as it is self-correcting. If it is caused due to vitamin D deficiency, this is usually corrected with vitamin D and calcium supplementation.
If there is pain or discomfort and difficulty in running, they may be advised surgery.
DDH or developmental dysplasia of the hip
In this condition, there is a problem with the development of the baby’s hip. It can affect one or both sides and the problem usually arises before the birth of the child. Any baby can develop DDH but some have a higher chance, it’s more prevalent in first-born children, girl child and breech presentation at birth. Occasionally, it is seen in families. Most children treated early have no hip problems as an adult and are happy active children.
The hip joint is a ball-and socket-joint where the top end of the thigh bone is the ball and the socket is part of the pelvis. The ball moves around the joint but does not come out of the joint. This lets us move our hips front back and side to side and supports our body when we are walking and running. In DDH, the hip is not formed properly and the ball part of the joint maybe completely or partially out of the socket. This is because the socket is shallow. If this is not fixed the hip joint will not grow properly and there will be pain while walking and development of arthritis of hip at an early age.Advertisement
In DDH, usually there is no pain in babies. The hips are usually examined at birth to screen for this condition. Occasionally, children develop DDH after birth. To prevent this, it is important not to swaddle too tightly and to make sure there is enough room for the baby to move her legs.
Parents may notice a clicking sound when hips are moved, they may notice one leg shorter is than the other and skin folds don’t line up under the buttocks or thigh. When children start to walk, they may notice a limp. Presence of any one of the above findings necessitates examination of the baby’s hip and a detailed ultrasound. An X-ray works well when they are older; it is not advisable at birth.
The goal of treatment is to keep the head of femur, which is the ball of the hip joint, in the socket so that the joint develops normally.
There are three modalities of treatment:
– bracing
– closed reduction and casting
– open reduction which is surgery and castingAdvertisement
Children under six months are usually treated with a harness called Pavlik harness. The baby is kept in this position for 6 to 12 weeks and regular checks are needed along with serial ultrasound to check everything is as it should be. Most children will only need this done if picked up early.
If this does not yield the correction required, they will move on to closed reduction or open reduction and casting. A hip spica is given to hold the hip in place and the baby wears the cast for two to four months.
Open reduction or surgical reduction is usually done if diagnosed late or if open reduction fails.
ALSO READ | Doctor in the House: Has your child developed a rash with fever? Here’s what she could be suffering from
These children will need regular follow-up with an orthopaedic doctor till they are 16 to 18 years of age to see that the hip is growing well.
Club foot or Talipes equinovarusAdvertisement
Talipes Equinovarus is a common foot abnormality, in which the foot points downwards and inwards. Usually seen at birth, it is more common in boys. It may involve one or both feet. If either of the parents have club foot, there is a 20-30 per cent chance of their baby having club foot.
Most of the time, the cause is not found and its called idiopathic club foot. Sometimes, it may be associated with DDH or spina bifida, arthrogryposis or myotonic dystrophy.
Sometimes, there are predisposing factors. The extrinsic variety is usually milder and may be due to the shape of the uterus, large baby or less fluid in the amniotic sac.
The intrinsic variety is more severe, the foot is smaller and the calf muscle on that side is smaller. There might be an abnormality of one of the ankle bones called talus.Advertisement
Occasionally, the diagnosis is made from an antenatal ultrasound. The ultrasound cannot assess the severity and can only be done after birth.
Treatment currently involves casting, bracing and surgery.
Most doctors use the PONSETI method. This usually involves serial casting beginning within the first week of birth. The success of the treatment depends on the overall flexibility of the foot and parents compliance with appointments for casting and bracing till at least four years of age.
Some children will need a small surgery called percutaneous transverse Achilles lengthening. In rare cases, children with severe or rigid club foot may need more extensive surgery.

Improving Survival Rates of Pediatric Cancers in Developing CountriesPremium Story,"When previously healthy, active 3 years old Sadana (name changed) got diagnosed as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the family got completely shattered, listening to the problem. Because of common belief in the public on cancer, they couldn’t believe initially that it does carry more than 80 to 85 % chances of cure. She came with a history of fever, along with pain in joints and legs. Her initial investigations and treatment options did not reveal definite diagnosis and symptomatic treatment. Later he started dropping blood counts, got diagnosed as ALL and treated for the same. Currently she is more than 3 years off treatment and leading a normal life. 
Overall, the cancer is increasing in incidence across the world so in India as well. Pediatric Cancer accounts for 7 to 10% of all cancers occurring every year.
Ten years ago, around 40,000 new cancers are diagnosed in children every year but now more than 55, 000 new cases are getting diagnosed and adding on to the existing pool. In the last two decades the incidence of cancer doubled, partly because of true incidence going up and partly secondary to better awareness of the problem in the general public and early diagnosis as people are reaching out to centers where diagnosis and treatment is available.
Thankfully many of the childhood cancers are highly treatable provided they are diagnosed on time and treated in appropriate centers where facilities and expertise to manage these children are available. This includes pediatric oncologist, pediatric surgeons, critical care team, other subspecialities like pediatric neurology, trained and competent nursing staff, dieticians, psychologists etc. In the last 3 decades, a common pediatric cancer like acute lymphoblastic leukemia survival rate improved from 20% to more than 80%. 
In children, cancers are more common in boys compared to girls. Most common childhood malignancy is acute leukemia also called commonly as blood cancer (30 to 35 % of total childhood cancers) followed by brain tumors, euroblastoma, lymphoma (lymph nodes), wilms tumor (kidney), muscle and soft tissue and others. 
Cancer symptoms depend on type, site and stage of cancer. Common symptoms of most common cancer, i.e acute leukemia include unexplained fever, pallor, bleeding, bone/joint pains. Symptoms of solid tumors mainly dependent on the site like brain tumors present with headache, vomiting, seizures, altered sensorium etc. Whereas tumors arising in the abdomen, generally present with abdominal distention, pain and other symptoms. Initial evaluation with complete blood counts, blood smear examination will raise the suspicion of acute leukemia, which should further get confirmed with bone marrow examination. Also doing genetic tests on this sample will help in risk stratification of these cases. Other cancers like solid tumors require local imaging followed by confirmation with biopsy, histopathology examination. Further staging of solid tumors is done with scans like PET scan, Bone Marrow examination etc. 
Principles of Management of these childhood cancers are same across the countries, but chemotherapy protocol varies slightly as per the research done locally and as per the local requirement. Management is divided into specific treatment which includes chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy where it is indicated and supportive care. In addition to chemotherapy, supportive care that is provided during management is very important. This includes safe use of blood products, timely and effective management of infections with antibiotics and antifungals. Preventive measures – for infection prevention, good nutritional support, safe blood products, appropriate antibiotics and antifungal usage – play a key role in supportive care. Other measures like pain control, psychological support and actively engaging families in care of their children are very important. Even in developing countries like ours with combined multimodal treatment in an appropriate center, where children are handled carefully, one can achieve results at par with western countries and many children are becoming long term survivors leading normal life.

Paris-based artist Sujata Bajaj on what makes Progressive artist SH Raza’s 1981 painting Maa essential viewingPremium Story,"Making art accessible to children, one artist and one artwork at a time
Artwork: Maa
Artist: SH Raza
Where can it be viewed? Currently on view at the SH Raza exhibition at Centre Pompidou, Paris
Why?
Every time I see this painting — or just a picture of it — it strikes me that it conveys a very strong message: it emphasizes how important it is for an artist to be connected with his or her origins. Strong roots allow the artist to fly and work anywhere in the world.Advertisement
The very first time I saw Maa was on the walls of Chemould Art Gallery in Bombay in the early 1980s. I was young. The painting made an overwhelming impression: the title Maa has the power and gravity of the panchatatva.
While I was admiring it something very interesting happened. The artists Bal Chhabda and MF Husain came by and both, like me, were mesmerised by Maa. They decided to buy it together and share the painting so to speak. They kept it for several years. I was lucky to have had many meals admiring this painting in their homes. Later, they sold the work. Being an abstract artist and colourist myself and coming from the land of colours, Shekhawati in Rajasthan, I connect with this painting organically. Its colours have depth and there is tension and flow. Maa conveys the artist’s magnetic attraction to his roots in Bharat. Raza’s love for India has been evident in several works of his, and also in numerous titles he chose. I recall a work titled Shekhawati, a huge painting where he had written “place of pilgrimage” in Hindi “Tirtha sthal”, a homage and gratitude for Rajasthan and its colours that so deeply inspired him throughout his life.

At one point, Raza had reached a crossroads in his painting. Living and working in France but very strongly connected to India he was in his own words a bit confused. Maa gave him the direction, Indian themes were to become his main source of inspiration. Maa in some ways called him home, and he actually did return to India after a gap of quite a few years.
This painting is a symbol of gratitude to his Maa, to his land of birth. All these aspects make Maa very special. It’s a landmark painting.Advertisement

‘There is no one-size-fits-all approach to parenting’: Experts share tips to manage rebellious behaviour in childrenPremium Story,"Over the years, Anuradha Premnath, a mother and principal, Orchids International School, saw things falling apart between her daughter and herself. “She would go on a hunger strike, lock herself up in a room, and not speak to me for days at a stretch. At times, she even behaved hysterically, with loud yelling,” she said, further sharing that her daughter’s behaviour made her feel like she had “failed as a mother”, which further “brought a ton of guilt and shame”. Despite feeling so, Premnath decided to counsel her child and help her overcome such “rebellious behaviour” at home with help from YouTube videos, reading books, and Google. But when none of these yielded positive results, she turned to a behavioural counsellor who had an informal interaction with her kid to gave her insight into her point of view, and things started to change for the better.
However, it is not just Premnath who struggled to better connect with her child and understand her perspective. Rachel J Amirtharaj, a fashion designer, has also felt her children being unruly and dismissive of her. “As a mother of three, I have seen my children rebelling against the rules set for them, being disrespectful, yelling, and not keeping their room clean,” she told indianexpress.com. But, instead of viewing this as rebellion, what helped Amirtharaj deal with the situation was seeing her children’s behaviour as a “way of them asserting themselves and establishing their individuality.”
As such, what is the best way for parents to connect with their children in a mutual way, where neither the parent nor the child feels sidelined and their thoughts and points of views do not clash with each other?Advertisement

Swati Mahajan, a parenting coach and psychologist, stresses that she deferred from calling a child “rebellious” simply because it is a stage they go through and not a constant quality. “Children seem rebellious when they want their own independence, and desire control, especially when they’re exploring their identities. However, as a parent or caregiver it becomes our responsibility to help them navigate through these stages so that this rebellion does not turn into a mean character trait later,” she said. 
Agreeing, Aanchal Narang, a counselling psychologist, called the ‘rebel phase’ in children, especially in teenagers, a “myth”, adding that children only rebel to communicate things they can’t through words. Mentioning the ‘Theory of Psychosocial Development’ by Erik Erikson, she added that in different stages of development, children go through different conflicts; “in early childhood (2-3 years old) their conflict is ‘Autonomy vs Doubt’ and in adolescence, it is ‘Identity vs Role Confusion’. Hence, at these ages, they are trying to establish their self-identity, personality, likes and dislikes. However, there is a growing assumption in Indian societies that disagreeing with parents is rebellion, which is false as exploring their own identity is important for children to become healthy mature adults,” she told indianexpress.com.
Experts point out that as a child grows up, they experience various emotional, intellectual and physical changes, which leads them to act out of impulse. So, as a parent, it is imperative to learn the root cause of the rebellion to prevent conflicts and endless battles. 
Adding, Mahajan shared a simple way to understand the cause of rebellion, “Children are their own beings with separate thoughts and feelings. Just because parents have brought them into the world, it does not mean kids don’t have their own individuality. Thus, what becomes essential is to strike a balance between their demands and needs. To do this, parents need to validate the concerns of their children. Instead of blaming them for certain behaviours, they must say that they understand why they are upset and ask them what they can do to help,” she said, further suggesting that getting involved with your children’s interests is another way to find a common ground and better connect with them. Advertisement

Sharing her experiences of trying something similar with her children, Amirtharaj said, “The first and foremost thing is to listen to them more. That’s when you know their interests and can be invited into their world. Like, my child likes to watch Naruto, an anime series, so I try to make time to watch and enjoy the show with them. This is the first step in building a strong bond with your children.” Similarly, Premnath makes an effort to meet her daughter’s friends and appreciate the things she likes, whether it is a new haircut or a “bizarre tattoo”. 
Another thing that parents find themselves struggling with is too much disciplining their children or not at all. “There are two kinds of parents. The first set of parents sense a loss of control and become very strict and put a lot of rules and regulations, while the other set, to avoid conflict or to prevent their kids from pushing them away, let them get away with doing anything,” said Mahajan, adding that it is important to strike a balance between obedience and freedom. 
Mahajan added that if we seek too much obedience from our children, they will miss developing problem-solving or leadership skills. On the other hand, a child given too much freedom will run amok and not know how to act in the outer world. 
Priya Vasnani, Clinical Psychologist, Fortis Hospital, Bannerghatta Road, Bangalore, agreed and said, “Firstly, being in tune, and supportive of your child’s needs, reciprocity and warmth, and secondly, the disciplinary efforts, supervision and willingness to confront a disruptive child, should be done proportionately.” She added that this parenting style is known as authoritative parenting, and is a healthy and effective parenting technique, which helps validate children’s thoughts and feelings, and boost their self-reliance and build self-image.Advertisement

However, experts point out that there might be certain underlying triggers causing certain rebellious behaviours, which parents must be mindful of. Listing them, Mahajan said that these include bullying, low self-esteem, peer pressure or seeking attention and approval. Concurring, Narang said, “For instance, if your child is getting bullied at school, they might not know how to communicate their emotions of sadness and anger. They would express this through rebellion since at a certain point, a parent could have dismissed their kid, making the child internalise the anger and feel unsafe to directly tell anything to the parents.”
For managing such a situation, Vasundharaa S Nair, Lecturer of Psychiatric Social Work, St John’s Medical College and Hospital, advised communicating with your child, both verbally and non-verbally. “It is important to check with them how their day was, understand what is happening in their lives, as well as give them space to share whatever they want– good or bad.”
The most valuable learning for parents is to not see parenthood as this glorified period where there are no fallouts between them and their children. “Parenting is rather complicated and there is no one-size-fits-all,” said Mahajan, adding that there are no set rules of what makes a good parent. Each child and parent relationship is unique and must not be compared with others. Sometimes, listening to your gut instinct is better than following a million things others recommend.

5 powerful ways to improve your child’s memoryPremium Story,"Most individuals have occasional lapses in memory, such as forgetting the name of an acquaintance or where they have kept the house keys. Likewise, children too, may forget a few answers during revision or when a homework assignment is due or if they have misplaced belongings at school. This isn’t something to worry about. However, if you are having to remind them repeatedly and you find them constantly forgetting, it could become problematic.
Memory is a person’s ability to absorb, store, retain and recall information. It has two major parts: short-term and long-term memory. Short-term memories contain information that you only need to recall for a few minutes, for instance, remembering an OTP for courier delivery. Long-term memories contain memories from holidays, events, your daily functions such as driving, typing, etc. as well as who you are. When children first learn something, it goes into their short-term memory before it reaches their long-term memory repository, and it is not uncommon for it to disappear at this stage.
Many factors play a role in forgetfulness or loss of memory, but I will keep that for another article. Today’s article will give you some practical and powerful ways to strengthen your child’s memory.
Focus Games Advertisement
Play games that boost concentration, attention and memory. Here in one simple and effective one: Take any magazine of choice. Give your child a common word such as ‘the’, ‘and’ or any one of your choice, to circle in the first to third paragraphs of a story. Once done, check if any of the words chosen got missed out! As you get used to it, you can add a timer to make it more fun and change the speed of the game. Gradually, try to do the words on the whole page. You can do this with your child to sharpen your memory too, and it gives you a great time to bond together!
Multisensory learning 
Multisensorial learning is not limited to reading and listening only. It involves using other senses to engage the child, thereby boosting short- and long-term memory. You can also convey information using touch, sound, smell and movement. Write down the tasks, say it out aloud, walk around to show it to them, let them use their hands to discover it further, or show an illustration of the activity. Doing this will stimulate different brain regions and help children strengthen their memory towards the task or the knowledge that needs to be retained. You could also ask them to repeat the information they have understood to enhance memory.
Small Chunks 
It’s easier to remember information when it is grouped in smaller numbers or sections. Like the space or hyphen between the 10-digit mobile phone numbers makes it easier to memorise. Similarly using highlighters, underlining, writing notes in different categories will make it easier to process and remember the information. Chunking is particularly helpful while communicating instructions to your children. Keep it short and group it together by task or activity. Lengthy instructions are harder for children to retain.

Power of Sleep Advertisement
Sleep is critical to learning and memory. There is a difference between hours of sleep you require to function optimally and just getting by the day. Researchers have found that children and even adults require eight to nine hours of sleep at night. Sleeping also helps the brain process and store long- term memories. Compromising on sleep consistently impacts memory, critical-thinking skills, concentration, creativity and so on.
Brain Foods 
Nutrition is very important for good health and better brain development. There are certain memory-boosting super-foods to easily include in your family’s diet – nuts, berries, green leafy vegetables. Eating these foods regularly will support the development of children’s cognitive abilities.
There are several more techniques for improving memory that are beneficial. Meditation is an effective example. If your child or family member is struggling with remembering things repeatedly, it will be helpful to consult a professional. I hope you can include a couple of more practices to the above, to boost your child’s memory and focus. These are suitable for adults too, so do try them at home!

Children and teens aren’t doing enough physical activity – new study sounds a health warningPremium Story,"Physical inactivity is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. It’s also associated with chronic illness and disability.
Recent research estimates that the world could see close to half a billion new cases of major chronic diseases by 2030 if people don’t get more active.
Regular physical activity helps to prevent and manage many chronic diseases. Popular ways to be physically active include walking, cycling, and playing sports.Advertisement
The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that children and adolescents (5-17 years old) get an average of at least 60 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity.
This should incorporate vigorous aerobic activities, as well as those that strengthen muscle and bone, at least three days a week. It’s also recommended that children spend no more than two hours a day on recreational screen time.
 Physical activity is very important for children’s health and wellbeing. (Photo: Getty/Thinkstock)
These recommendations aim to improve children’s physical and mental health, as well as cognitive outcomes.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, physical activity among children and adolescents was already below the recommended levels. In 2016, 81 per cent of adolescents around the world aged 11-17 were considered physically inactive. Girls were less active than boys.Advertisement
The pandemic has made matters worse. Physical inactivity in children and adolescents has become a global public health priority. It is now included in global action plans.
For example, using 2016 as baseline, the WHO through its Global Action Plan on Physical Activity targeted a 15 percentage point reduction in prevalence of physical inactivity among adolescents by 2030.
This call to action also implored other international organisations and governments to help track progress in physical activity promotion among children and adolescents.
In response to this global physical inactivity crisis, the international call to action, and the need to systematically collect comparable data, the Active Healthy Kids Global Alliance recently published a major study, the first to provide a comprehensive assessment of physical activity among children and adolescents.Advertisement
Published in October 2022, the study included data that were collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We were among the 682 experts who assessed 10 common physical activity indicators for children and adolescents around the world.
Our study shows physical activity among children and adolescents has not gotten better. About one-third of children and adolescents globally were sufficiently physically active while a little over one-third met the recreational screen time recommendation for better health and well being.
These findings indicate that a significant proportion of children and adolescent who do not meet recommended physical activity guidelines are at an increased risk of negative outcomes as well as developing related chronic diseases at a much earlier age.
COVID effect
Most of the experts involved in our study agree that the childhood physical inactivity crisis is an ongoing public health challenge and the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have made it worse.Advertisement
When surveyed, more than 90 per cent of the experts reported that COVID-19 had a negative impact on children’s sedentary behaviours, organised sport and physical activity. Our findings are supported by numerous studies.
Lockdowns imposed at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic led to school shutdowns and closures of public parks, which hampered children’s levels of physical activity.
Research suggests that children’s moderate-to-vigorous physical activity decreased by 17 minutes per day during the pandemic. That represents a reduction of almost one-third of the recommended daily activity.
Another global study representing 187 countries showed a collective 27.3 per cent decrease in the daily step counts of individuals after 30 days of COVID-19 related restrictions.
Our studyAdvertisement
Four African countries participated in our study –Botswana, Ethiopia, South Africa and Zimbabwe.
The grading ranged from as high as A+ (large majority, 94-100 per cent of children and adolescents achieving recommended levels) to as low as F (less than 20 per cent achieving recommended levels).
Children and adolescents from the four African countries were marginally more physically active than children from the rest of the world.
They received C- (47–53 per cent of them met recommendations) for overall physical activity compared to the D (27–33 per cent met recommendations) for the rest of the world.Advertisement
More children and adolescents from the African countries used active transport (B-; 60–66 per cent), were less sedentary (C-; 40–46 per cent) and were more physically fit (C+; 54–59 per cent), compared to the rest of the world (C-, D+ and C-) respectively.
An important success story from this global comparison of grades is that despite the lack of infrastructure, average grades for individual behaviours were generally better for the African countries.
This could be reflecting necessity, rather than choice. For example, children might be forced to walk to school because there’s no affordable transport.

Nonetheless it shows that it is still possible to promote healthy lifestyles even when resources are limited.Advertisement
Factors such as having supportive family and friends, safer communities, positive school environments and adequate resources are often associated with better participation in physical activity.
Average grades for these sources of influence were generally lower for the four African countries than those of the rest of the world.
These findings demonstrate the challenges related to community safety, a general lack of infrastructure, and funding to support healthy behaviours for children and adolescents in African countries.
Overall, there wasn’t enough data to accurately grade all the indicators for the African countries.Advertisement
Botswana was the only country for which we were able to assign grades for each of the 10 common indicators. The other three countries had at least one incomplete grade each.
Lack of representative data is a common and often recurring problem in many low- and middle-income countries. It also means that our findings must be interpreted with caution.
 Children should not get used to a sedentary lifestyle (Source: Pexels)
For example, we can’t say with certainty that these findings are representative of all the children and adolescents from these four countries or the region as a whole.
Way forward
In many parts of Africa, the prevalence of infectious and other diseases justifiably demands attention and resources. These needs can out compete the messages about physical inactivity, whose negative impact may be silent but still detrimental to population health.
We need to persistently advocate for policies and practices, anchored in the African context, and promote equitable opportunities for children to engage in physical activity. These can include active school recesses and extracurricular programmes.
Countries need to ensure access to safe, free public spaces, green spaces, playgrounds and sporting facilities.
Finally, researchers and public health practitioners must track the progress towards meeting the WHO’s targets.

Take Time: Is your tween showing the following behaviour? It might be a call for helpPremium Story,"As a working mental-health professional, I see a number of adolescents on a daily basis. Based on my interaction with them, I have noted specific areas of concern in adolescents.
Grief, fear, uncertainty, social isolation, increased screen time, and parental fatigue have negatively affected the mental health of children. Friendships and family support are strong stabilising forces for children, but the pandemic had also disrupted them.
Screen addiction

Being glued to the screen as the only means of entertainment has caused many children to get spectacles, though there has been no genetic history. Weaning the gadget off has been a major concern for most parents. Soaring screen time has been one of the biggest concerns faced by adolescents today.Advertisement
Sleep cycle

A routine sleep cycle is established only once sleep hygiene is maintained. This refers to having a fixed time to sleep and wake up each day. This further leads to individuals having a fixed biological clock or time that they wake up. The pandemic has led to children having no fixed time or schedule and even now they struggle to wake up for school/college.
Social anxiety

Some kids have never attended formal schooling earlier and, so, meeting friends or new people causes them anxiety. Some prefer to stay alone or not socialise with anyone. Some students dislike going to school or college as they feel inferior to their friends and thus feel judged.

Social networking apps

Many kids have made friends with strangers on social media, who they now term as their closest circle. Being a part of these online circles, adolescents do not feel the need to leave their comfort zone and interact with people around them. Most online friendships end abruptly leaving the adolescent heartbroken.

Academic concerns

Most students have struggled academically, with poor grades and a lowered academic performance. The same can be seen in case of children who have either not concentrated enough or got distracted during the long break between school/college.Advertisement
Attention deficit

One of the most common concerns from parents is that their children do not listen at all. There could be many reasons for this. Some include inattention, preoccupation, defensiveness or lack of interest. Setting family rules and goals could help to maintain an adequate equilibrium.
Weight gain

Lack of dietary discipline, along with no routine form of exercise, can be two very important reasons for the same. In some cases, the latter could lead to a reduced self-esteem and concept caused due to poor body-image issues.
Eating disorders

Disordered eating, related to stress, poor nutritional habits, and food fads are relatively common problems among the youth. In addition, eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are on the increase among teenage girls and young women and often run in families. This includes either starving oneself and not eating at all or eating and then forcefully vomiting out what has been eaten to avoid the guilt of eating.
Aggression

Most adolescents today are labelled as “stubborn” by their parents. They often refuse to listen to their parents and communication is reduced to a form of barter system with their parents, which is often need-based only.Advertisement
Behavioural concerns

Adolescents these days are often irritable and do not listen to their parents at all. These cause rifts in family life. Adolescents today sadly do not trust their parents and prefer to trust friends known to them.

Time management

Lack of appropriate time management and discipline is seen in adolescents as they struggle to complete a given task, including completing exams and assignments. It is essential to make sure one divides the 24 hours a day efficiently and does not waste time.
It is understandable that a lot of delays and behavioural concerns have arisen after the pandemic. However, it would be incorrect to not seek help presuming that things would get better over time. It is important for parents and caregivers to observe behavioural changes and seek help if the concerns persist for over a month.

Doctor in the House: How to potty train your toddlerPremium Story,"Toilet training or potty training is a cornerstone for most parents, and requires immense patience. Parents must mentally prepare themselves before starting this process.
As a parent, the most important thing for you is to assess when to start the training, depending on how ready your baby is physically and mentally.
When is the right time to start?
There is no fixed age to start potty training, each child is different, and it depends largely on physical, behavioural and developmental milestones of the child. Usually, girls are faster at this than boys and there should be no forcing involved as it will backfire.Advertisement
This usually happens around two years of age, but some children may be ready only by three years while others may start around 18 months. If you start too early, it may take longer.
ALSO READ | Doctor in the House: Here’s why your child could benefit from the flu vaccine
Signs that show that your little one is ready to start:
*She is able to follow simple instructions
*She is able to understand words regarding going to the toilet
*Can make the connection between the urge to pee or poop with making it to the toilet to do it
*Will sit on the toilet for enough time to get the job done
*Has dry diaper for two to three hours
*Shows interest in sitting on the toilet seat and is able to pull training pants down
There may be instances when you may have to postpone the start of the toilet-training process, such as:Advertisement
*If you have a big holiday planned
*If there is a new baby coming soon
*If your baby has been sick
*If you have moved house or relocated
The whole process of toilet training does not happen overnight, it usually takes a few months and may even take more than a year to go a full night without incident. Understand that it depends on each child and be prepared for some accidents.
What potty seat to start off with:
There are two types, the stand-alone one, which then can be emptied into the toilet bowl. The other one is a seat that fits on an adult toilet. For this, you may need to use a foot stool so that they can rest their legs on the stool. This way they feel supported.
For boys, its best for them to sit and pee on the toilet rather than stand and do it initially and then transition to standing and peeing.Advertisement
When travelling long distances, be sure to carry a potty seat with you and try and make few stops on the way.
You can use the training pants or pull-down diapers when you start the process before you move to underwear. Nighttime bladder control for children lags behind daytime control. So, some parents use these training pants at night. Once you notice that they are dry most nights you can take them off completely. Some parents feel using these training diapers slows the process but you can take a call on that depending on your child’s temperament.
How to toilet train:
It’s important to remember that once you embark on this, you need lots of time and patience. This cannot be hurried.
*Use small words like “pee or POO” to express the act of using the toilet so that its familiar to them
*Tell your child to let you know when their diaper is soiled with either pee or poo
*Try and identify behaviours like holding on to his penis when he wants to pee, so that the child is able to recognise the urge to pee or poo
*Make them sit on the toilet or potty seat fully clothed first and once they are used to this you can make them sit bare-bottomed
*You can show your child how to sit and can even take him with you while you use the toilet, or a sibling uses it so that they know what to expect
*Never force them to sit against their will as it will backfire
*Try and set a routine. If you find the diaper is dry for over an hour you can try then or after a nap or after a drink. Initially, do it once or twice a day and then build it up slowly
*It’s good to try after a meal as the gastro-colic reflex, which is the body’s natural tendency for a bowel movement, usually kicks in after eating. If amenable, make sure they sit for 10 to 20 minutes after a meal
*When you notice certain behaviours like crossing legs or grunting, ask your child if they want to do potty. Show them how you dispose it into the toilet when it’s done in a diaper or stand-alone potty
*Make them wear clothes that are easy to remove when you are training them as at that time you don’t want to be fumbling with zips and fasteners
*Offer small rewards and you can use star charts. Let all the people involved in his life, like care givers and grandparents, know how you are going about it and what words you are using so that there is no confusion
*Offer lots of praise even for just sitting there and nothing happens. Be ready for accidents and don’t show your displeasure or punish your child. Rather, explain to your child what they should be doing and reassure them that it’s only an accident and offer your support
*At times of stress, there may be more accidents like when a new baby arrives or when he or she joins play school, but if accidents continue to happen, please talk to your doctor, especially if your child is over four years of age.

What makes French-American artist Louise Joséphine Bourgeois’1999 sculpture Maman essential viewingPremium Story,"Artwork: Maman (sculpture)

Where can it be viewed: Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao, Spain
Bannikuppe-based artist Cop Shiva on what makes French-American artist Louise Joséphine Bourgeois’1999 sculpture Maman essential viewing
Making art accessible to children, one artist and one artwork at a timeAdvertisement
Why?
In the summer of 2015, I was visiting the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, when I found myself in front of a terrifying, larger-than-life sculpture of a spider. I was captivated by it, and I have re-visited it many times after. This colossal sculpture, called “Maman” (mother), is the perfect representation of the artist Louis Bourgeois‘ mother. Despite its terrifying appearance, the spider looks graceful and mighty at the same time. Just like she saw her mother.
 Maman was created in 1999 in bronze, stainless steel, and marble. It is among the world’s largest sculptures, measuring over 30 ft high and 33 ft wide. (Pic source: Cop Shiva)
In her own words: “The Spider is an ode to my mother. She was my best friend. Like a spider, my mother was a weaver…Like spiders, my mother was very clever. Spiders are friendly presences that eat mosquitoes. We know that mosquitoes spread diseases and are therefore unwanted. So, spiders are helpful and protective, just like my mother.”
It is precisely in childhood, and in her relationship with her mother, that the roots of the artist’s creative process are found. Bourgeois was born in 1911 in Paris and her parents owned a gallery that dealt primarily in restoring antique tapestries. Bourgeois grew up watching her mother weave and mend frayed fabrics, and she taught herself the trade when she was 12. Her mother’s death following a long illness when she was 21 inspired her to abandon mathematics and pursue a career in arts. For Bourgeois, who adored her mother, this was a traumatic episode that influenced her work. Her mother, even though she was loving, was also possessive and controlling with her: this can be seen in the sculpture, which is an archetype of a caring but strong mother.

This sculpture was created in 1999 in bronze, stainless steel, and marble. It is among the world’s largest sculptures, measuring over 30 ft high and 33 ft wide. It includes a sac containing 17 marble eggs which she protects within a steel cage-like body balancing on long and slender legs. “Maman” is a mighty female, standing like a mythological beast protecting her children.
I have always felt very inspired by this work because in my work I also look for intimacy and the memory as a source of inspiration. Indeed, Bourgeois’ imagery and sculptures are wholly autobiographical. In her work, she relives her childhood traumas, obsessions, and longing for a mother and a caring father. Her art evokes her psyche, and her art practice becomes a therapeutic or cathartic process to fulfil a desire to connect with loved ones and re-construct fading memories.Advertisement

All You Need to Know About Absence EpilepsyPremium Story,"6-year-old Master A was brought to the hospital with multiple brief periods of staring vacantly along with some eyelid blinking. He had been having these episodes since the age of 4 years. He would not respond when the teacher called him and was thought to be inattentive in class. He was diagnosed to have childhood absence epilepsy and was treated. 
Why were these fits not recognized and treated?
The most common impression of fits or seizures is that of a person becoming stiff or jerking, becoming unconscious, frothing from the mouth, passing urine. But some seizure types like absence seizures do not present this way. They are more subtle and hence not identified and treated. These children are often thought to be daydreaming and not concentrating or inattentive in class. 
How to identify an absence seizure?
During an absence seizure the child appears to go blank, stops doing what he /she was doing and just stares into space. They may blink their eyelids briefly or open and close their lips but usually do not jerk or make many movements. These episodes start suddenly, and children get back to their activities as soon as the episode ends. They usually occur in children between the ages of 4 -12 years old and children usually have many such brief episodes in a day.
How to recognize an absence seizure from daydreaming 
Absence seizures happen at any time, even while doing activities like eating, playing, drinking, speaking etc. while daydreaming usually happens when the child is sitting idle. So, if a child suddenly has these episodes especially while doing his activities he must be taken to the doctor.  
How are absence seizures diagnosed?
Absence seizures can be diagnosed in an outpatient clinic by a procedure called hyperventilation and by taking an EEG with hyperventilation. 
How are absence seizures treated and are medications lifelong?
Absence seizures are treated with specific anti-seizure medications. Most children with childhood absence epilepsy respond well to medications. The seizures usually settle by mid – adolescence. Rarely, some children can have other seizure types and later seizures. 
Why is it important to treat absence seizures?
Children with childhood absence epilepsy have many episodes per day which can affect their attention and learning. Also, activities like swimming, cycling may be unsafe for these children. So, it is important to identify and treat absence seizures.

What are the small ways you might want to opt out of the highway of life?Premium Story,"As the new year rolls out, it makes many of us want to reflect on the previous year and hope for a better time ahead. In one such conversation with a young person, it took an interesting shape. “I hope 2023 brings me a life worth living.” Her words have stayed with me and have reverberated with many other conversations I have had to create a rich symphony of reflections. Does life worth living have to do with falling in line with culturally defined ideas of success – getting into top colleges, a lucrative career which ensures all the trappings of wealth or possibly fame? Wouldn’t that be just following socially predetermined highways that do not leave much time for wandering around the trails that might take us to unknown destinations?
The pandemic was a catalyst in starting a wave of what began to be termed “Great Resignation”, where we saw people across the world leaving their high-paying jobs to do things that gave them a sense of meaning. Moving out of cities, downsizing to smaller homes with simpler lifestyles and finally being able to do things that gave them joy and meaning. In many ways, it does speak of privilege as many of us might not have that freedom to make a choice as we have homes to run, children to educate and bills to pay. But if we go beyond this restriction, this powerful idea can have a huge impact on the way we live our lives, the pressures to conform and inevitably the cost to our planet of this life of high consumption.

Somebody I met recently shared, “I have always wanted to travel to quaint, unknown parts of the world but had always pushed that plan to later and focused on staying ahead in the race. Recently, I lost a 57-year-old friend to a sudden heart attack. It made me realise that there is no other time but now. What is the point if I wait for another 10 years and realise that my body cannot travel to these places any more? I was always scared of squandering money, but now I am scared I am squandering my life!” His words keep echoing in my mind as I wonder if while running our life on mindless auto-pilot of fitting in, we forget the finiteness of our lives and what makes it really worth it. What are the experiences that you would like to create? What are the tiny things that bring you joy that you would like to weave into your daily life? What little and big adventures you might want to take in the coming year that will live as cherished memories for the rest of your life?
Opting out: Getting stuck to what 25-year-old Shyla called the “metaphorical hamster wheel” of course comes with its perks – money, a sense of being productive and achievement but there is a cost to it too. We end up being compelled to follow culturally prescribed pathways laid out for us devoid of agency, creativity and meaningful experiences. Therefore, no surprise that the pandemic shook all of us out of our collective stupor and made us really reflect on what constitutes a life worth living. I wonder if this is the question Jacinda Ardern asked herself before making the decision to resign as the prime minister of New Zealand as she “no longer had enough in the tank.” Maybe when it is not easy to opt out completely, we might be able to fill up our “tank” through small acts of resistance like not letting our worth be defined by the targets we have to reach, finding time for playfulness, and taking a spontaneous road trip. What matters is an engaged life — to make sure we take out some time every day to do things that stretch and expand us, and help us align with our values and hopes for a deeply meaningful life. When that is taken away from us, we are left with despair, hopelessness or maybe even burnout as we feel acted upon rather active agents. Think of the last time you did something that made you feel alive and gave you a sense that you were doing something that truly mattered to you. What is it that you were doing??

Loitering: When I asked Shyla, what had helped her to step out of the hamster wheel, she introduced me to the idea of “cosmic insignificance” that she had read about in Oliver Burkeman’s book Four Thousand Weeks (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2021). She said, “Don’t you think we take ourselves and our stay on this earth too seriously? We are like a blip in the history of humankind? Even if we do something truly remarkable, two generations down will not remember us. Isn’t the cosmic insignificance of our life enough for us not to give a damn? The indifference of the universe challenges our ideas on inefficiency, productivity and white-knuckling it out.” It was a truly liberating perspective as somewhere in knowing our insignificance, we can find so much peace in our imperfection and impermanence. What are the tiny, small ways you might want to opt out of the highway of life to find more scenic routes?Advertisement
I grew up in the mountains where rambling and loitering was the way of life. So I struggle with the fast pace of urban life and need lots of aimless time when I just do nothing. It’s in these white spaces that we find our joyous epiphanies, the “Aha” moments and where sparks of life happen.
And that is what I am taking to the new year – gathering experiences not things, opting out and aimless loitering.

Kids cause suffering (at least for parents) but do they make you unhappy?Premium Story,"Some influential studies show that the decision to have kids leads to greater suffering — at least for parents.
A famous study by Nobel prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman and collaborators showed that working women experienced more negative, and less positive, emotions while caring for kids than while engaged in almost any other activity (except cleaning the bathroom).
Subsequent research has shown that the effect is mediated by factors such as wealth and social support, but the central point remains. Even in the most favourable circumstances, having kids is a less than optimal way to maximise the overall amount of pleasure and enjoyment in your life.Advertisement
Also Read  | Mothers who recognise others’ happiness are more responsive to their infants in first months of life
Such findings have been interpreted in popular and scholarly discussions as implying that kids are not a great source of happiness. In his New York Times bestselling book, Stumbling on Happiness, leading Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert claims findings like Kahneman’s reveal that the idea that “children bring happiness” is a false “super-replicator”: a cultural myth designed to keep unsuspecting parents passing on their genes, even though it makes them miserable.
The tagline on Gilbert’s book reads “Think you know what makes you happy?” Well, think again.
Gilbert’s book is full of interesting and important insights about pleasure and enjoyment and the “mistakes” we systematically make while (supposedly) seeking to maximise them. But is maximising pleasure and enjoyment really our ultimate aim? And is it really what most people mean by “happiness”? Suppose that having kids fails to maximise overall pleasure over the life course and may even sometimes be net unpleasant. (Having lived through more tantrums and overflowing nappies than sleep deprivation permits me to count, I don’t disagree.) Does it follow that having kids makes you unhappy? Are studies like this really measuring happiness, or happiness of a kind that matters? To be clear, we should note that such studies are measuring pleasure (positive and negative affect) in a broad sense. We are not talking just about superficial fleeting bodily sensations which are obviously peripheral to happiness in the long-term sense, but psychologically deep and pervasive emotions and moods like the ratio of joy and engagement to stress and boredom.
Still, does it really come as a surprise that kids are frequently exhausting and unpleasant? Or that a few particularly memorable moments of joy are, in some sense, outweighed by many fortunately less memorable moments of anxiety, fatigue, boredom, and frustration.Advertisement

Higher pleasure
The fact that many of us know this, and still treat kids as a source of happiness, suggests that (at least as many use the term) happiness is not simply to be identified with a favourable balance of enjoyment over suffering. (As books on pleasure and enjoyment don’t sell nearly so well as books on happiness, the temptation to relabel is understandable.) Moreover, the idea that happiness can be reduced to pleasure and enjoyment has historical precedent, albeit recent. Formed from the middle-English “hap”, “happiness” originally meant “fortunate” or “lucky” and referred to how well things were really going for a person, not simply to their (possibly deluded) state of mind.

By the late 1700s, however, a new uniquely feeling-based way of thinking about happiness had emerged, especially in England, reinforced if not initiated by the work of influential thinkers such as Jeremy Bentham.
Bentham famously put happiness front and centre of his philosophy of how to live, proclaiming “greatest happiness” to be the sole end of conduct and “the foundation of morals and legislation”. He took pains to clarify that by “happiness” he did not mean what Aristotle meant (virtuous activity), but nothing more than a felt sensation.
John Stuart Mill, followed in his godfather (Bentham’s) footsteps, but departed from him by insisting that pleasures and pains could and should be distinguished by their quality as well as quantity of felt experience. The “higher,” qualitatively superior pleasures make a greater contribution to happiness.Advertisement
Mill’s view sounds objectionably elitist, but it is not. The test of whether one type of pleasure is “higher” than another is simply whether someone who has experienced both types of pleasure would prefer it, when considering it just as a feeling (apart from its usefulness).
Just as two glasses of wine may differ in their quality (as well as quantity), so Mill thought that one pleasant experience (e.g., the “flow” experienced by a musician absorbed in playing a challenging piece or a bushwalker immersed in nature) may be better quality than another (watching Netflix).
Might having kids be, or at least lead to, higher pleasure? Possibly, though Mill, himself childless, never directly considers it.
While Mill distinguished certain pleasures as superior in felt quality, pleasure itself — and so happiness — remained a wholly inner subjective experience. But there is a more ancient tradition of thought that takes happiness — or at any rate the kind of happiness most worth pursuing — to depend on its sources, as well as how it feels.Advertisement
Pleasure taken in the wrong sources — say, from a bottle, or which results from wilful blindness or delusional thinking — is not authentic happiness, and contrasts with genuine pleasures of actual relationships and achievements.
Also Read  | What keeps a working mother satisfied and happy?
Think of the denizens of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World with their never-ending free supply of Soma. Are they really happy? Or are they living in a fool’s paradise? More than pleasant feelings
There is evidence that our assessments of happiness are sensitive not just to how someone feels, but also to the sources of these feelings; and hence that happiness, as ordinary people sometimes use this term, does not simply refer to pleasant feelings.
Be that as it may, the kind of happiness (if it is) that comes out of a syringe is not the kind of happiness that most of us value most highly — otherwise denizens of Brave New World would be living the good life, but hardly anyone on reflection agrees with this.Advertisement
“Happiness” sometimes refers simply to a bunch of pleasant feelings, but it can refer to more than just feelings. While we care about feeling good, we often care about other things more. Creation, growth, a sense of achievement, and connection — even when things are difficult, challenging or downright unpleasant.
So, while we may agree that children are far from an unmitigated bundle of joy, we may want to resist the move to saying that they are not a great source of happiness — or, more generally, to identifying happiness simply with feeling good. There are other, perhaps more important, kinds of happiness.

How spatial thinking could help children learn maths – and go on to use it in their careersPremium Story,"Do you struggle to visualise how to rotate your shoes so that they nest together in a shoe box? How are you with flat-packed furniture? Are you good at giving directions?
These everyday activities require spatial thinking. Spatial thinking is important for mathematics, and it is what we use to understand the properties of objects, such as their location, size and shape, as well as the relationship between objects.
When we manipulate objects in our mind’s eye – such as visualising how to rearrange our living room – we are using spatial abilities. When we navigate our way home from a trip out, we are using spatial abilities.Advertisement
People who have strong spatial skills are more likely to be interested in science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) and to choose Stem degrees and Stem careers.
This association is unsurprising when you think about the skills required for Stem: using graphs to visualise patterns of data in maths, understanding the scale of a diagram of the solar system, or using the spatial layout of the periodic table to understand chemical relationships.
ALSO READ | A good dad’s guide to managing paternity leave
Nevertheless, spatial thinking is given little emphasis within the English national curriculum. It has recently been de-prioritised as an “early learning goal” for young children.
Lacking maths skills
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak recently announced his ambition for all children to continue with maths education to age 18, citing the need for maths skills in the workforce. And it does seem that these skills are lacking.Advertisement
The UK Stem industry is thought to lose EUR 1.5 billion annually as a result of Stem skills shortages. Around half of working-age UK adults have only primary school level maths, and maths difficulties are estimated to cost the UK around EUR 20.2 billion each year, according to the charity National Numeracy.
Sunak proposes to continue maths education past 16. But focusing on spatial training for younger children is one promising avenue for increasing maths enjoyment and maths achievement, as well as nudging the next generation towards Stem careers.
Spatial skills can be improved by training, and spatial training consistently increases achievement in mathematics and other Stem disciplines, including at degree level.
The largest effects of spatial training among children are for those from disadvantaged backgrounds. This means that spatial training provides an opportunity to reduce attainment gaps. It could bolster catch-up after pandemic school closures for the children most affected by this learning loss.Advertisement
What’s more – and particularly important for maths’ sometimes dull image – spatial activities are enjoyable. Engagement scores for our spatial activities and training suggest that children like learning in this way.
Improving spatial ability
There are some easy ways to improve spatial ability. Visualisation – imagining a process in your head – has been linked to stronger science and maths performance and it can be improved through training.
Younger children could discover visualisation by being encouraged to imagine rotating jigsaw pieces in their head, rather than trying to fit pieces in a puzzle through trial and error.

Older children could be prompted to use visualisation as a mental sketchpad when rearranging maths formulae.Advertisement
Small-world play – such as with dolls houses or toy farm sets – can be used to help children learn to see things from other viewpoints and understand differences in spatial scale.
Both of these are spatial skills which help with maths and science.
In a preprint study (which means it has not yet been reviewed by other scientists) colleagues and I have also found that following visual instructions when using construction toys, such as Lego, can help spatial skills.
It helps with mental rotation (rotating a piece in your mind to figure out which way round it should go) and understanding the relationship between parts and a whole, such as the individual bricks in a Lego model. This is useful for fractions and maths proficiency more generally.Advertisement
As a final example, children who hear more spatial language have stronger spatial skills, and stronger spatial language is associated with better maths performance.
This means using words as simple as “in”, “on”, and “next to” to describe the spatial relationships between objects, or “small” and “big” to draw attention to the properties of objects.
More difficult words like “parallel” and “separate” can help children to conceptualise otherwise difficult spatial concepts, particularly if hand movements are also used to help explain the meaning.
I am a member of the Early Childhood Maths Group, an independent group of early years mathematics enthusiasts and experts who work together to promote early childhood mathematics. The group has launched the Spatial Reasoning Toolkit to help adults support children’s development in spatial activities.Advertisement
Introducing more spatial thinking to the curriculum could reduce attainment gaps, increase confidence and nudge children towards Stem careers. Children’s enjoyment of spatial activities could also help to change attitudes towards maths.

A good dad’s guide to managing paternity leavePremium Story,"The idea of paternity leave is for the dad to be as involved in the joy of raising a child, since early discussions on the level of involvement, role of people beyond the parents set the tone for you to figure out your parenting style with fewer fights! Here are some guidelines on how to make your time worthwhile to the two people to whom it matters most — the new mum and the newborn.
Also Read | A father writes on fostering pro-dad workplaces
It may sound counterintuitive to hear a mom give out this guide, but to be fair, having spent over a decade raising two kids with the shared experience of other mums gives me a fair perspective in putting this together. And while dads at various stages of being a parent have contributed to putting this together, I’d be happy to have more dads write in!
Parenting is one of those things that makes for an ideal case of equal partnership — it is the very core argument of the institution of marriage. So, here is a handy guide for dads on how best to use their immediate paternity leave to make this an equal responsibility.Advertisement
What to do if you have only one week of leave:
Assuming, of course, that the pregnancy is going well and smooth, take the whole week off from the time you go into labour.
Set up the village for your child: It does take quite a few hands to raise the child, so get your people in place — a well chosen care-giver, full or part time who can come in and relieve the new mum for a few hours. The grandparents – They are likely to have fully handled babies more than two decades ago when the world was very different. Align with them that you both want their support and advice BUT they need to trust your ability to learn on this job and should leave the decision making to the parents.

The dad is in a good position to bring this up with the parents respectfully and firmly.Advertisement
· Learn the basics of child management: How to change a diaper, how to give the baby a bath, how to get bottles sterilized and ready, what temperature of milk is right to offer to the baby, how to get the baby to sleep. Do this at least a few times a week. Once the baby is a little more manageable, the mum will get back to her work as well and the responsibility of raising the baby, that includes physical chores, are to be managed by the both of you.
· Emotional Support: That life-long discussion about parenting choices you’re going to have, it starts now. It is baptism by fire. No matter how much you have both read up and prepared, all plans go out of the window once the first bullet is fired, or in this case, once the first cry is heard. The mum goes through immense physical, emotional and hormonal upheaval and a lot of self-doubt. It may seem to you that there is too much pressure over every little decision, but being there to say, ‘we will figure this out together’, is important.
What to do if you have six months of leave:
Well, I must congratulate you on the joy you will get out of bonding well with the baby! It need not be all six months at home though. Here is a great way to split the time across years:
First up, do the list above but over a month so that both parents are confident and comfortable with the whole set up.Advertisement
Also Read | Does your child also not value things as much as they ought to? It’s time to try out scarcity parenting
Between the two parents, if you both choose for the mom to avail the full maternity leave, I’d suggest the dad actually takes only one month in the beginning and split the next eight weeks as one week of leave every quarter to spend with the bub. Watch them grow and be a part of the
milestones: the baby-proofing, the period of discovery as you see the world again through the baby’s eyes!
The last three months, I’d suggest taking a month off around the age of five-six years, when the child starts school. It is also the time that the child starts identifying with the father and wants his attention. It is a good time to get out and do school pick-ups and lots of play to get their energy spent and help manage tantrums.
The last two months would be great to spend on travel and exploration in the summer holidays before classes VIII and X. These are the first years that the child starts seeing a lot of stress related to both identity and school work/exams. Spending an extended period of time together can help relieve silences and initiate conversations, hopefully for all the tough times in life.
If working in the same company for many years to cash in this leave over a period of time sounds like a pipe dream, do it anyway. Take the full six months in the beginning, but also take time out at various milestones as above. You may not be able to take a month off, but plan for at least a week off with only yourself and the child.Advertisement

There may always be a debate about one partner, typically the wife, taking on a lot more of the household and invisible chores for the family and we will find the balance that works, but in the case of parenting, there can be no debate that the responsibility is equal and that the dad’s role has to extend beyond providing financial stability alone.

“Perfection is possible in ideal circumstances. However, ideal situations do not exist in the real world. Therefore, accepting ourselves might be more effective in being better parents because they would know when to change their parenting style based on situations,” says Zutshi.
She further added, “Parents should not be worried about being perfect or ideal because parenting is like a skill, and our experience makes us better. Expecting to be perfect might put unrealistic expectations on parents and failure may be perceived with a lot of self-criticism”.
Things parents should never do to their kids
Striving for perfectionism is a mistake and can lead parents to practice harmful attitudes like being judgemental and critical of their children. These behaviors are detrimental for a child’s healthy growth. Zuthshi, lists outs some points that the parents should keep in mind:

1. Parents demanding perfectionism also puts those expectations on children which might become the conditions of worth for the children.Advertisement
2. Parents should not punish or behave punitively towards children when they make errors. Mistakes are a part of human behaviour and room for errors must be allowed for children’s natural growth.
3. Being neglectful, authoritarian, or over permissive behaviour might yield unhealthy emotions and behaviour in children.",parenting
Doctor in the House: Here’s why your child could benefit from the flu vaccinePremium Story,"Influenza vaccine
The “flu” is a viral illness brought on by the influenza virus. The virus causes inflammation of the nose, throat and lungs. It is highly contagious and can make the patient quite unwell. In certain cases, the flu can lead to serious complications like pneumonia etc. The flu vaccine however, significantly reduces these complications. In the Western world flu is mostly seen in the winter months, but here in India, it can happen post monsoon and also during the winter months. It is best to get the flu vaccine early in the flu season, so if your child is going to get the vaccine it is best given before monsoons in India. The vaccine takes about two to four weeks to generate the antibodies, so your body is equipped before the flu season starts. Getting the flu vaccine late is still better than no vaccine at all.

Types of flu vaccines
Currently there are two types of flu vaccines – the flu shot, which is administered via a needle, and the nasal spray, a mist that is sprayed into the nostrils. Both the vaccines protect against four types of influenza virus: The nasal spray is only for healthy individuals between the ages of 2 and 49 years. People with weak immune systems or existing health conditions and pregnant women should not take the nasal spray vaccine. It should also be avoided by children who are on aspirin, have a cochlear implant or who have recently taken antiviral medicine for the flu.

Babies under six months cannot be given the flu vaccine, but if the caregivers get the vaccine, there is less chance of the baby getting the flu. Children under nine years of age need to get two shots one month apart if they are getting the vaccine the first time, after that it is one shot every year. To children over nine years, it is usually given as an intramuscular injection. This vaccine is usually given in the upper arm or front of the thigh. It can cause soreness or redness around that area for a day or two. Some children especially teenagers can faint after the vaccine, so it’s better they sit down to get the shot and remain in the doctor’s waiting room for 15 minutes. Currently, the vaccine has very little egg protein so even children with egg allergy can get it, but make sure it is done in hospital or the doctor’s office and the child is observed for at least 15 minutes.Advertisement

Why the flu vaccine is recommended
Like any other vaccine, this is not 100 per cent effective. However, if you do get the flu, it is likely to be milder in those who are vaccinated. Getting the vaccine helps reduce the spread of the flu virus as every year thousands of people die of influenza, especially the elderly. If you got the flu vaccine last year, it can’t provide enough protection this year, because flu viruses change. That’s why the vaccine is updated each year to cover the most recent types of the virus. Getting the flu vaccine helps create protective circles by protecting you, your child and those around you. It makes contracting the virus less likely, and thus hinders the spread of the virus.

"Making art accessible to children, one artist and one artwork at a timePremium Story","ARTWORK: Three Musicians, 1921
ARTIST: Pablo Picasso
WHERE CAN IT BE SEEN: In the collection of  Museum of Modern Art, New York
One of the most influential and celebrated artists of our times, April 8, 2023 marks the 50th death anniversary of Spanish artist Pablo Picasso. While museums across the world are marking the anniversary through various exhibitions and events, the governments of France and Spain are working together on a year-long set of retrospective exhibitions dubbed “Celebration Picasso 1973-2023”, which will focus on specific periods of his art, celebrating his life and legacy.

The father of Cubism, he introduced the avant-garde art movement in the early 1900s in France, rejecting traditional perspective and emphasising on two-dimensional surface. One of his large paintings, Three Musicians, also appeared on the Indian postage stamp in 1982. Measuring 6ft 2 inches on each side, the square was painted in 1921, when he was spending the summer with his family in Fontainebleau.Advertisement
With three deconstructed angular figures in bright colours seated around a table in a box-like room, there are several interpretations of the work. Some believe that two of its characters come from Commedia dell’arte, a popular form of theatre from the 16th to the 18th century in Europe: on the left, in blue and white, is Pierrot as a clarinet player; and Harlequin, in orange and yellow, is with the guitar in the middle.
The monk in the black robe is not part of the theatrical stage, but Picasso does make him a part of his set. Another interpretation suggests that the Pierrot figure was poet Guillaume Apollinaire, a friend of Picasso’s, and the Harlequin was an alter ego for the artist himself. The monk, meanwhile, was French poet Max Jacob.  With musical notes in front of them, as the three seem to play music, a dog sits beneath them, with only his tail visible under the table.

Top 4 activities for an emotionally healthy home for 2023Premium Story,"There is a freshness to the beginning of the year, filled with resolutions on improvement, both personally and professionally. It is a good time to think creatively on the family front too, be it raising your children or improving the home environment. Small changes during the year will result in some big accomplishments by the end of 2023. As parents, if you are looking to do something new this year, here is a list of four activities that will positively charge your children and home.
1. Family Happiness Jar – You know by savouring small things, you can make life sweeter and happier. This is not only a personal favourite but also a practical way to boost one’s happiness. This one is different from the gratitude jar you may have seen on Instagram. Here is how to create your own Family Happiness Jar with children (and grand-parents, too):
a) Get some nice paper and a jar for each family memberAdvertisement
b) Every week, add a note in the jar about a moment of happiness you experienced thanks to one of your family members. The more you fill it up with happy and thankful experiences, the more meaningful it becomes.
c) You can dedicate a morning in the week to do it all together, as each member of the family must do their own
Take this jar along on your next family vacation and unfold these notes or you could do it at the half-year point. Whoa! You will experience sheer joy and bliss, I assure you.

2. Actionable Theme – Your family bonds will strengthen with attention and affection; also, it makes for happier family members. This involves showing your care and concern for your loved ones, prioritising family, and spending quality time together. You could create a theme for any activity your family would like to do and make it interesting, such as “Stories on Sunday” for reading, “Thoughtful Thursday” for heartful talks to each other or doing the happiness jar activity, and “Wellness Wednesday” for exercising together. Make your own themes to bring more fun and happiness into your family!Advertisement
3. Respectful Home Environment – Disagreements, fights and arguments are not a bad thing at all, but the way you act and react during it might be. Making threats, abusing, throwing things, and not speaking to each other are actions that impact the overall harmonious environment at home. Instead, as adults, you can commit to respectful ways of resolving it. Some actions could involve setting boundaries, giving in at times, and addressing the problem when in a cooler mind, and so on.
4. Use tools for emotional management – With the face-paced life today, emotional distress is a big part of it. You can incorporate healthy coping techniques as situations you’re faced with cause anger, stress, and frustration. The rhythmic tool described below is extremely effective when done daily. This will set an example and show your family members that you are committed to being emotionally healthy.
Rhythmic Breathing Tool:
Inhale to the count of 4, letting your belly fill up with air
Hold for 4 counts
Exhale to the count of 4.
Pause. Repeat again.

Bringing about change and self-improvement comes with consistent effort. Usually, it’s the small consistent actions which give giant results. The journey of parenting and family relationships is by no means easy, but by nurturing your children, meeting the needs of loved ones and looking after yourself, your family unit can be stronger. I hope you incorporate these four actions into your life. Have an incredible year ahead!Advertisement

Why happy rather than sad music soothes newborns – new researchPremium Story,"Music is the language of emotions, arousing and regulating our feelings. For example, research has shown that college students listen to music 37 per cent of the time, and it fills them with happiness, elation or nostalgia during 64 per cent of these sessions.
Children might have even greater exposure to music than adults do. Survey data shows that 54 per cent of teachers in South Korea use background music in schools. We also know music is played as often as 6.5 times per hour to help children’s learning in US classrooms.
But how early do children develop a real appreciation for and understanding of music? Our recent study, published in Psychological Studies, suggests newborns may be rather musical, finding happy music soothing in particular.Advertisement
This could be seen as surprising because, ultimately, culture plays a major role in when and how we understand music – it’s something we learn. Preschoolers, for example, are often unable to pair pictures of happy or sad faces with happy or sad music. Such ability usually develops later in childhood.

It has long been unclear whether newborns and young children feel emotions in music. But we know that newborns respond to aspects of music, such as its beat, structure as well as consonance and dissonance.
Young infants also love “motherese”, a very musical, melodic and slow type of speech that adults often adopt when talking to babies. Even those babies who can hear but were born to deaf parents (who don’t speak to them in this way) pay attention to such speech or maternal-style singing.
Some research suggests even foetuses seem to respond to music. One study has shown that when pregnant women at the 28th week of gestation listen to their favourite songs, their foetuses’ heartbeats increase, even though the mothers show no change in their heart rates.Advertisement
Other studies, however, have failed to find any such reaction in foetuses. Music is often trialled to help prematurely born babies in neonatal intensive care units. But of the ten most rigorous studies with newborns in intensive care units, only half found any behavioural response to music, such as reduced crying, stress or pain. And only half of the studies found any effect on heart rates or blood pressure.
That said, very few studies have looked at how healthy, full-term newborns react to music. And no studies have examined how they respond to emotions in music.
Happy is calming
Our team looked at how music affected healthy newborns, who were carried to term. First, we wanted to select a music piece that was really happy, and another that was really sad.
Two experimenters collected and listened to hundreds of lullabies and children’s songs and selected 25 of these that sounded happy or sad. Only six of these were sung in English (Simple Simon, Humpty Dumpty, Hey Diddle Diddle, Little Miss Muffet, Ding Dong Bell, Little Bo Beep) while the others were in various other languages.Advertisement
A total of 16 adult participants helped to rate the 25 songs for their emotional content. A French lullaby entitled Fais Dodo (by Alexandra Montano and Ruth Cunningham) was found to be the saddest, while a German song, Das singende Känguru (by Volker Rosin), was ranked the happiest.

We played these two songs in random order – along with a silent control period – to 32 babies in a first experiment. We also analysed how 20 behaviours, such as crying, yawning, sucking, sleeping and limb movements changed millisecond by millisecond during the music pieces and the silence, respectively.
In a second experiment, we recorded the heart rates of 66 newborn infants while they were listening to these two songs or silence.
Perhaps the most striking results was that babies started to downshift to sleep during happy music, but not to sad music or when there was no music. Also, they showed a decrease in their heart rates during happy music but not during sad music or silent periods, suggesting they were getting calmer.Advertisement
In response to both happy and sad music, babies also moved their eyes less frequently and and there were longer pauses between their movements compared with the silence period.
This might mean that both types of music had some calming effect on the babies compared with no music, but happy music was the best.
Our results suggests that newborns thus do react to emotions in music, and that responses to music are present at birth. Earlier, we worked with foetuses and found that second and third trimester foetuses respond when their mum is talking. So listening to talking, singing and music may pre-shape babies’ responses to music in the womb.
Traditionally, lullabies are sung by the caretakers, usually the mothers. Such singing is very personal and emotional. Mothers who come to our lab, often tell us that long forgotten lullabies they heard from their own mothers and grandmothers, suddenly come to their memory when singing to their own babies.Advertisement
The mothers’ emotions when singing likely shapes their babies’ responses to music. Even with healthy babies, there is always a need for a soothing intervention as they cry on average for about two hours a day in the first weeks of life.

Soothing by music, played or sung, is widespread throughout the world and across times for a reason. Babies are born with an innate musicality and sensitively respond to music.
And now we know that it is happy, animated and fast music that particularly resonates with their psychological and physical rhythms – enabling soothing, calming and sleeping.

How to keep children hydrated during wintersPremium Story,"Dr Parvinder Singh Narang
We always assume that dehydration only occurs in the heat and summers, along with health complications like loose motions and vomiting. Since heat and sweat are gone in the winter, it makes sense to assume that your child doesn’t need as much water as he or she did in the summer. However, for the overall health, children still need to drink plenty of water throughout winters as well. For parents and childcare workers, knowing the signs of dehydration is important.
It is fairly common for children to get dehydrated. When a child is busy, drinking water is not the first thing on their mind. Children may not realise they are thirsty until they are nearly dehydrated, if they do not have access to a beverage. Therefore, when you are with your child, keep water handy and offer it frequently, either every couple of hours or more frequently when the air is particularly hot in the summer or dry in the winter.Advertisement
Also Read | Equal Parenting: It’s not only about sharing baby care responsibilities
Signs of dehydration include:
* sunken eyes
* loss of skin turgor
* reduced urine output
* cold peripheries
* your child plays less and seems less interested
* the baby’s head has a sunken soft spot.
They typically do not exhibit loss of skin turgor in the winter, and since the edges of their bodies are already cold, parents are unable to recognise the signs of dehydration.
Also Read | A science teacher explains: Is water a good conductor of electricity?
The main reason for dehydration in winter is a change in fluid/water consumption. They consume less water, but our bodies still require a lot of fluids for digestion, breathing, and circulation. The first step in providing adequate hydration is knowing how much fluid is needed:Advertisement
* Four cups of liquid plus 1.5 cups of food for children aged 1-3
* Five cups of liquid plus two cups from food for children aged 9-13
* Eight cups of liquid plus 2.5 cups from food for those above
In the winter, children wear too many layers of clothing, which causes a lot of fluid loss through sweating and insensible losses caused by metabolism in the body due to breathing and digestion. They may become severely dehydrated as a result. This is another factor causing dehydration in children in winter. To address this, again the body needs additional liquids.
Winter dehydration differs from summer dehydration and unlike excessive thirst in summer it causes:
* headaches
* nausea
* irritability
Also Read | The early years: Here’s what you should feed your kids at each stage
Nausea and headaches further reduce fluid intake and exacerbate dehydration. Dehydration also affects memory, sleep, and cognitive function, affecting academic performance. As a result, we should encourage children to drink more water even in the winter and monitor their urine output. Dehydration also affects children’s cognitive functioning and sleep, making them more irritable. To avoid dehydration in the winter, ensure that children drink enough liquids and produce enough urine.Advertisement
One major factor is that no one likes to consume more water in the winter which leads to severe dehydration. To prevent this, we should:
*Keep giving them extra liquids like fresh juice, coconut water, and fresh fruits. This way, you not only keep your kids hydrated, but you also make sure they get their water at every meal, which is especially important in the winter when kids often don’t feel thirsty and forget to drink water! Juices made with apples, oranges, pineapple, carrots, beetroot, and other fruits will nourish your child and strengthen their immune system.
*Serve drinks at room temperature because it keeps the body at a constant temperature. Compared to cold drinks, which force the body to work harder to adjust, this will cause us to lose heat faster rather than keep it for warmth. Warm liquids like soup and hot milk can also help them stay hydrated and avoid dehydration in the winter.
*Eat green leafy vegetables, milk, oranges, strawberries, lychees, oatmeal, cantaloupe, celery, yogurt, and other water-rich foods every day to get more water into your system. Also, try to cut back on fried and processed foods like cake, pasta, pastries, white bread, chips, and pizza because they make your body lose water and make you thirsty afterward.Advertisement
*Let children play outside in winter, but in layers. On a cold winter day, it might seem safer to keep the kids inside, but playing all day in a heated house can dry everyone out. Instead, let your kids play outside in the sun and let the moisture from the cold air naturally get into their bodies. As long as your children are dressed warmly and in layers, crisp, cold air can be refreshing for their health.
Winter is a time for having fun. It is up to us to teach our children about providing their bodies with the appropriate nutrients and hydration necessary to fight off winter viruses and infections, just as your car needs more fuel to stay energised on the road. Therefore, don’t hesitate to boost your family’s vitality during the winter months when the cold sets in: by drinking water slowly, effectively, and thoroughly.

Can Boys be Born with an Absent Testis?Premium Story,"As a boy grows in the mother’s womb, his testicles form inside the abdomen and gradually move down into the scrotum. In some boys, this may be delayed or arrested due to various reasons and the boy will be born with either one or both testis absent. This should raise warning bells in parents to seek timely help.
Whom should we consult for the problem?
A Pediatric Surgeon should be consulted at an appropriate time after birth who will document if the testis is felt outside the abdomen or not felt at all.
Why is it necessary to get the testicles to its normal position?
The higher temperature of the body may inhibit the normal development of the testis, which could lead to infertility, vulnerability to injury or rotation and rarely cancerous changes.
When should this abnormality be corrected?
This should ideally be done around 6 months of age, but definitely before the child completes his first year. 
What if the testis is seen sometimes in its normal position and missing otherwise?
In some boys, the testicles may be seen only intermittently in the normal position. This condition is called RETRACTILE TESTIS. This is a normal condition and there is no need to treat this condition but requires examination by a Pediatric Surgeon.
What are the treatment options?
If the testis is felt, a simple surgery called ORCHIOPEXY and done as a day care admission. Laparoscopy for a testis inside the abdomen is the gold standard in the management of this condition worldwide. Sometimes in rare situations, the testis may be completely absent or the size so tiny that it warrants removal. The surgery is generally safe in the hands of experienced surgeons and anesthetists.

Doctor in the House: Weaning babyPremium Story,"Most new parents are excited about the whole process of starting solid food for their babies and tend to get carried away — within a month of starting, they are feeding the baby two or three meals.
Most paediatricians will tell you that you should breastfeed your baby exclusively for the first six months and then start introducing solid food. But, by five to six months, most babies are ready to eat solid food as a complement to breastfeeding. By this time, babies typically stop pushing food out with their tongue and begin to develop their coordination to move solid food from the front of the mouth to the back.
When is your baby ready for weaning?
Your baby is ready to start weaning when the baby can hold his/her head steady and sits up with support. Your baby will be mouthing their hands and toys all the time and they will be leaning toward your food and will be interested in what you are eating.
How to start off?Advertisement
When we start weaning, start with once a day and do it in the morning hours ideally, between two milk feeds. I prefer that babies are offered vegetables as the first food and that sugar or salt not be added to their food for the first year.
Start with a single vegetable or a couple of vegetables that cook well and can be mashed smoothly with a spoon or fork, initially you will have to smoothly mash it as otherwise the baby would gag on the food. Give this for two to three days before you move on to a new vegetable. You can add a small amount of unsalted butter or ghee and a pinch of other condiments like turmeric or asafoetida to add flavour to the food. Give as much as the baby will take and don’t be disappointed if she spits it out the first time. You can use potatoes, carrots, peas, pumpkin and other gourds.
After a few days, you can add soft mashed dal like moong dal, arhar or masoor dal and follow this by adding rice and feeding it as a soft khichdi. By one month, when your baby is eating a small bowl of khichdi, start the second meal as a mashed fruit.
Give one fruit at a time for a few days, increasing the quantity to as much as the baby will tolerate. Once you have tried three to four fruits, you can give a mixed fruit puree.Advertisement
Rice or suji porridge can be given and you can use cow’s milk to make the porridge. Don’t give cow’s milk alone as a feed till your baby is closer to one year. Yoghurt and paneer can be given if there is no history of cow’s milk allergy. You can use fruit or mashed raisins or dates to offer some sweetness to the porridge.
By eight to 10 months, your baby should be able to handle small portions of finely chopped finger foods like fruit, vegetables, idli, uttapam, soft paratha. You can introduce dalia, oats, ragi and barley by this age.
Chicken, fish, eggs, and even meats can be introduced side by side as long as it’s well cooked. You can start off using stock to cook the rice and vegetables.
Babies often reject their first servings of pureed food as the taste and texture is new. If your baby refuses please don’t force, and just try again after a few days.
When to introduce potentially allergic foodsAdvertisement
Potentially allergic foods can be introduced along with the rest of the diet:
— peanuts
— egg
— shellfish
— wheat
— fish
There is no evidence that introducing these foods later is of any benefit. Do it at home, in the morning hours and keep an antihistamine handy.
What to avoid
— Don’t give juice to the baby, rather give fruit. If you want to give it, especially in the summer months, do it closer to a year, not before. Too much juice can lead to dental caries and can also lead to a runny stool.
— Honey is not recommended to children under one year as it may contain certain spores that can cause a very serious illness called Botulism.Advertisement
— Don’t offer large pieces of fruit or meat or cheese that are choking hazards. Be with your child when they are learning to bite and swallow.
Encouraging baby to experiment
— As soon as your baby can sit well, it might be prudent to use a high chair where she can be strapped in.
— Encourage your baby to explore and play with the food and feed herself. Offer your baby a spoon while you feed her with a spoon. This will help her to learn independent feeding soon. Don’t force feed when your baby turns away, avoid power struggle.
— Around nine to 10 months of age, try offering water or even some formula or breast milk in a cup.Advertisement
— Enjoy your baby’s sticky face, gooey hands and messy tray and floor, as this encourages a lifetime of healthy eating. Encourage them to feed from your plate once they are older and don’t fuss too much that it has a little salt or sugar.

Curious kids: Do all animals have belly buttons?Premium Story,"Do live-born lizards have belly buttons, and do live-born reptiles have an umbilical cord? – Gaelle, aged 12, Bristol, UK What an interesting question!
A belly button or tummy button is technically known as a navel or umbilicus.
Humans have belly buttons because before we are born, we are connected to our mothers via an umbilical cord. This is a tube that delivers nourishment to the unborn baby, known as an embryo, and removes waste. It runs from the placenta – an organ in the mother that provides a source of food and oxygen – to the tummy of the embryo.Advertisement
Once a baby is born, it can get nourishment such as milk through its mouth, and the umbilical cord is no longer needed. The umbilical cord shrivels up and drops off after a few weeks. So, a belly button is basically a scar from where the umbilical cord used to attach to the baby’s tummy.
Humans are part of the group of animals called mammals, and other mammal babies develop inside their mother in the same way, getting nourishment from the placenta via an umbilical cord.
Belly buttons are quite large in humans, so they are pretty obvious. They are also visible in large mammals such as dolphins, orangutans and whales. Smaller mammals like cats, dogs and mice also have them, but the scars do not form large holes and they are often covered by hair or fur.
Also Read | Embryo grading: Why it’s important during IVF treatment
Other animal babies develop in different ways, though. Animals are actually separated into three groups, depending on how the embryos develop.Advertisement
The first type is the one we have already talked about – when the embryo develops inside the mother and gets the food and oxygen it needs from the placenta.
The second type is animals that lay eggs. These animals, including reptiles, birds, amphibians and some mammals, don’t have a placenta to provide food for their babies. So, do they have a belly button too?
Animals that lay eggs
Animals that develop in eggs, rather than in a womb, still need food. But, instead of getting this from the mother, the food is present in the egg in a special area known as the yolk sac. This is the yellow bit that you see in the middle of a fried egg. Don’t worry, there are no babies in the eggs that you eat – they are unfertilised, meaning that they wouldn’t ever develop into babies.
The embryos in fertilised eggs aren’t able to drink the nutritious yolk through their mouths, in the same way that human embryos can’t drink until they are born.Advertisement
Instead, the embryos inside the eggs are attached to the yolk sac by a smaller feeding tube called the yolk stalk that goes to the tummy of the embryo.
The yolk stalk is similar to the umbilical cord, and it also dries up once the baby hatches as it is no longer needed. So, yes, animals that come from eggs do have a belly button scar, but it is usually so tiny that you would have difficulty seeing it.
But what about reptiles like lizards or snakes? They don’t have a placenta, like mammals, but they often don’t lay eggs. They are in the third group of animals.
Ovoviviparous animals
For these animals, the embryo develops inside an egg, but the egg stays inside the mother. These animals are called ovoviviparous animals. Sometimes the mother lays the eggs just before the babies are born, which is what the duck-billed platypus, an Australian mammal, does. Often, the eggs hatch inside the mother, so she gives birth to live-born babies. This is how some sharks and rays are born.Advertisement
Reptiles like snakes or lizards are often ovoviviparous. Although they are live-born, they have not been attached to their mother via an umbilical cord. Instead, they have received nourishment through the yolk sac, via the yolk stalk.

So, yes – all animals have a belly button. Even dinosaurs had belly buttons! Recently, a fossil of a relative of triceratops was found with a belly button scar very similar to the scars found on modern-day alligators.
The animals that have been attached to a mother through an umbilical cord, though, generally have a much larger belly button than those that have been attached to an egg yolk via an egg stalk.

What makes Nandalal Bose’s 1938 Haripura posters essential viewingPremium Story,"Artwork: Haripura posters, 1938
Artist: Nandalal Bose
Where can it be viewed: In the collection of National Gallery of Modern Art
The first principal of Santiniketan’s fine-arts college, Kala Bhavana, Nandalal Bose was a pioneer of modern Indian art who trained generations of artists. Greatly admired by his seniors, he guided his students to take inspiration from nature and art traditions like him. Mentored by Abanindranath Tagore, Bose’s influences ranged from Japanese Nihonga traditions to Mughal and Rajasthani miniatures, palm-leaf manuscripts and the murals at Ajanta caves.

This set of works, known as “Haripura Panels”, were painted by the artist at the behest of Mahatma Gandhi in 1938 for the pandal for the Congress session at Haripura, Gujarat. By this time, the polymath had already created his iconic portrait of Gandhi during the 1930 Dandi March, and had decorated the Congress pavilion at Lucknow in 1936.

A post shared by Val Young (@valyoungmcr)


At the Haripura session, the panels were meant to decorate the gates and the pandal pavilion, intended to portray village scenes familiar to ordinary people, using local material. Bose stayed in Haripura for months to observe the local population and customs, creating several preparatory sketches. The panels in vibrant earthy colour palette and with energetic lines offer a window into everyday lives, from a potter to a hunter to a bull wrangler. If there are women engaged in household activities such as cooking, pounding rice, feeding an infant, there is also the depiction of a dhobi with his donkey and washed clothes. Painted with natural pigments on handmade paper, the posters were exhibited at the India Pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 2019, and are also currently on display at the National Gallery of Modern Art in Delhi.

How to tell your child (and at what age) they are adopted?Premium Story,"A child brings a lot of happiness and also responsibilities. However, parents of children who have been adopted may often wonder about the right time to have ‘the conversation’ with them. Before you plan to do it, you may want some questions answered. Dr Aarti Bakshi, Developmental Psychologist and SEL Consultant at SAAR Education spoke with Express Parenting and revealed the top critical questions that may come to parents’ minds when they decide to speak about it with their kid.

“Whether biological or adopted, kids are special to their parents. Adoption is forever and the love of the parents is forever. Once there is trust, love, and confidence, talking to the kid about adoption shouldn’t be a concern,” she said. Once you have made up your mind, it is important to decide how you are going to reveal it to the kid. Dr Aarti suggested talking in simple terms and in a calm tone.
As a parent, you may wonder about the right time or the right age. The expert feels children as young as four and five years are mature enough to be told that they are adopted.Advertisement

“Sit down as a family and talk about it. Show albums on how the child has been a part of your family. You can involve a relative who played a role in getting the child into your home. However, initially, the conversation should be between the child and the parents only,” she said.
“The talk should involve lots of hugs, conversations, and understanding. Questions should be encouraged whether verbally or non-verbally. Hugs are needed to make the child realise they would always play be an integral part of the family and will not be abandoned,” she added. According to her, this is a way to remind the child that he/she will always be special to the parents.
Post revelation, the child may have a combination of emotions; they may also fear abandonment. “Questions like, ‘Why did my biological parents leave me?’, ‘Do I have other siblings?’ Also, there can be anger towards the biological parents or the adoptive family. The child can become extra quiet,” she said about how the kid may respond.

“The more we hug and act normal the better the relationship becomes,” she suggested.Advertisement
However, there would be times when you may find it tedious and overwhelming to talk about this, and may even question your decision to tell the kid in the first place. Is it, therefore, essential to do it at all? Dr Aarti said, “Yes, Of course! It’s not a secret. Every child needs to know where he/she came from. Why did the parents make them a part of their family? How much do they love/adore them, and how important this child is to their world? This is important. Secrecy is not the way out,” she concluded.

A science teacher explains: Is water a good conductor of electricity?Premium Story,"By Rachna Arora
Water is one of the most incredible, versatile and essential constituents of life. While 70 per cent of Earth is covered with water, 60 per cent of our body is composed of nothing but water. It is a universal solvent and a priceless life nourishing force. It serves as a transport medium for nutrients and other indispensable compounds and helps flush out waste products and toxins, thus qualifying as an elixir for all living things.
The water molecule is composed of two atoms of hydrogen and one oxygen atom (H2O) bound by sharing of electrons and forming a covalent bond. The electrons are not uniformly shared by oxygen and hydrogen atoms, but are attracted to oxygen atoms more strongly than to hydrogen. This gives water a disproportionate distribution of charge — the hydrogen side of the molecule carrying a slight positive charge and oxygen side a slight negative charge, making it a polar molecule.Advertisement
ALSO READ | A science teacher explains: Why do flowers have a scent?
It is this polarity that enables the water molecules to strongly attract other polar and ionic molecules. The relatively-smaller water molecules surround the molecules of ionic or polar compounds, disrupt the attractive forces that hold the solute molecule and thus dissolve it. Most water we encounter in daily life contains some amount of dissolved substances, ions that can move freely.
Water mixed with electricity is considered to be a bad idea. It can be lethal to come in contact with this dangerous pair. If we investigate the complexities of chemistry, we find that pure water is actually not a good conductor of electricity. Water that we use in our day-to-day life contains a substantial quantity of dissolved substances, chemicals and minerals. In order for electricity to flow through a liquid, movement of charges must take place in the liquid. Whether tap water, rain water or sea water, these contain innumerable impurities such as sodium, calcium and magnesium ions, atoms that have a net charge due to loss or gain of electrons.
ALSO READ | A science teacher explains: What if there was no moon?
Since water has free charges due to the presence of these impurities, it becomes a conductor of electricity. When water is made a part of an electric circuit, the positive ions are attracted by the negative terminal and the negative ions are drawn in by the positive terminal of the battery creating a closed path, thus enabling the flow of current and making water a conductor of electricity.
Actually the presence of a small number of ions is all that is required to make water a good conductor. However, the more the number of ions, the more efficient it is as a conductor. That is why the likelihood of getting an electric shock in sea water is much slimmer than at home as current would choose the low resistance path of sea water with such high salt content and spare us. This also elucidates why it is taught in schools that one should not touch electric appliances with wet hands as water can easily slip into cracks and crevices, closing the path between us and the electric circuit giving a rude shock.Advertisement
ALSO READ | A science teacher explains: The world through the eyes of an insect
Pure water and distilled water have no impurities and, therefore, no ions, but only neutral molecules. So such water cannot conduct electricity. In fact, distilled water is one of the best insulators known to science. It is about 80 times less conductive than air. This means we can operate hair dryers and toasters inside water, with no fatal consequences, provided the water is pure or distilled.
Water is amphoteric in nature, it can act as both a base and an acid by accepting or releasing protons depending on the circumstances. Water also undergoes a process called auto ionization or self-ionization. If we have pure water with pH of 7, and hence neutral, it might so happen that two of the water molecules interact, while one may donate a proton, the other will accept it. This results in the formation of the negative hydroxide ion and the positive hydronium ion. Here, water is acting as an acid and a base. Thus, self-ionization may seem to be sabotaging the insulating properties of water, but very few water molecules dissociate into the hydroxide and hydronium ions, forming the same strength of positive and negative ions, thus cancelling out the net effect. Self-ionization does not result in making water conductive and still maintains the pH of 7.  It is the presence of impurities that is conclusively responsible for the conduction of electricity by water.

Electrical conductivity of water has many environmental and industrial applications as this can tell us how much dissolved substances, chemicals and minerals are present in water. In a water treatment plant, a significant increase in conductivity can indicate an increase in pollutants or a sewage leakage and thus corrective measures can be taken. Hydrologists also keep a close tab on electric conductivity of water as fish can survive up to a certain conductivity range.
Salt or no salt, water has been a vital resource throughout history. It touches every aspect of our lives from health to safety and serves as the foundation of our economy. We put water to work in a million different ways every day. It is our collective job to safeguard water, promote environmental stewardship and deliver sustainable solutions for this essential element.Advertisement

Take Time: How to recognise social anxiety in yourself and your childrenPremium Story,"Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is a globally prevalent, chronic, debilitating anxiety disorder affecting the youth at some point in their lives. With co-morbidities including major depression, substance abuse, lower educational and work attainment, and increased suicide risk, it has a significant public health burden.
The pandemic had, at one point, created a physical distance between people. Most meetings and communications were online only. Now that things are nearly back to before, most people are facing difficulties owing to this transition. Many now dislike physical meetings and feel anxious over them.
There are some common manifestation areas of social anxiety. Some of them are:
Social situationsAdvertisement
Most adolescents dislike participating in any social functions, specially the ones that involve relatives and close family members. They find it difficult to make conversations and feel awkward when they are forced to attend the same.

WFH culture
Some individuals have stated that they were happier with the work-from-home (WFH) setup and have dropped out of jobs that demand in-person attendance.
School/college attendance
Many youngsters have developed insecurities about their grades and looks, and feel that staying at home and attending lectures online made them feel more secure. Attending college for them implies being judged and, thus, some students have preferred to either bunk college or only attend during the examinations.
Performance-orientedAdvertisement
Performance oriented social anxiety disorder is when you experience intense fear and anxiety during speaking or performing in public but not in other types of more general social situations.

Past history
Social anxiety disorder usually comes on around 13 years of age. It can be linked to a history of abuse, bullying, or teasing. Shy kids are also more likely to become socially anxious adults, as are children with overbearing or controlling parents. If one develops a health condition that draws attention to their appearance or voice, that could trigger social anxiety.
Online socialisation
Most young adults have made friends on social-media platforms. These friends often have only spoken online and never met in person. A person here has the liberty to choose who he/she wants to speak to, based on their likes and dislikes. These online friends provide each other with validation and, thus, a person does not feel the void of not meeting up with people in person.
Trust issuesAdvertisement
Most individuals have, at some point, been betrayed by a peer, friend or in a relationship. This leads to them losing faith in any new friendship or association. They prefer staying by themselves and do not wish to attempt to know anyone for the fear of being betrayed again. A bad experience also makes them typecast all individuals as being the same.

Comparison
The fear of comparison, of not being as good as another person, can cause a person to totally avoid a social situation. Often, at a social situation when two individuals of the same age group meet, the tendency to compare who is doing what, is high. Some may dislike this and thus choose to not be a part of a social situation.
COMMON SYMPTOMS
Physical symptoms
The physical symptoms one may experience can range from profuse sweating, tightening of the chest, trembling voice, dry mouth, ringing in the ear, dizziness, nausea, heart racing, headache and shortness of breath.
Emotional symptomsAdvertisement
Intense fear of being negatively judged, based on inadequate social performance, constant worrying, severe awkwardness or inferiority around authority figures, extreme reluctance to express opinions, feelings of shame and inferiority.

Symptoms in children
For children, anxiety about interacting with adults or peers may be shown by crying, having temper tantrums, clinging to parents or refusing to speak in social situations.
Treatments
Various treatment options can help people manage their symptoms, gain confidence, and overcome their anxiety. Without treatment, however, social anxiety disorder may persist throughout life, though it may feel better or worse at certain times. Healthcare professionals will usually recommend treatment with psychotherapy, medication, or both.Advertisement

Conclusion
Social anxiety disorder is not uncommon. Approximately 5 per cent to 10 per cent of people across the world have social anxiety disorder. It’s the third most common mental health condition, behind substance use disorder and depression.
Social anxiety disorder symptoms can change over time. They may flare up if a person is facing a lot of changes, stress or demands in life. Although avoiding situations that produce anxiety may make a person feel better in the short term, the anxiety is likely to continue over a long term if it is left untreated.

8 ways to stay mentally strong through 2023Premium Story,"Even as you celebrate the festive season of weddings and holidays and are gearing up for a fresh and adventurous 2023, the Covid crisis looms again. For many, the new year could be daunting. Physical and mental health go hand-in-hand and it impacts an individual’s moods, well-being, productivity and motivation. Being healthy is more than eating right and exercising. Therefore, it is important to keep these mental health tips in mind (and saved on your device) to prioritise your well-being and stay strong through the year.
Each of you might face different struggles in the new year – an intense anxious hour, a parenting fear, the stress of caring for a sick loved one and so on. As the problems differ, so do the coping styles and self-soothing ways. But no matter what your challenges are, your feelings are valid, even if no one else thinks so; you can take small and big steps to look after your mental health. Here is a list of 8 ways to achieve this:

1. Brighten your outlook – You can achieve this by consciously holding on to positive experiences and feelings for much longer and being grateful for them. Give less attention to the negative ones. Doing this will enhance your mental well-being significantly.Advertisement
2. Find what helps you destress – Is it sitting on the couch with a blanket sitting cross-legged and meditating, walking outdoors, reading, getting a massage or playing video games? You need to rest and allow yourself to release pent-up stress doing what helps.
3. Compassion for yourself – Be compassionate to your mind and silence self-criticism. Do this by speaking to yourself the way your best friend speaks to you. This will enable you to stay calm and to prioritise your needs.

4. Vent your Emotions – When issues weigh you down and you can’t talk to someone, write it out and vent in a diary or journal. This is an effective way to let off things that are brewing, so you have a fresh start the next day. Include exercise in your schedule to boost your mood.
5. Quality sleep – To fit in everything, one often compromises on sleep. It allows your body and mind to recharge and is vital to your well-being. Start with fixing bedtime and rising time, follow it consistently and minimise distractions.Advertisement
6. Strengthen family relationships – Communicate and spend quality time with immediate family members and loved ones. Consider doing an activity together, take initiative to support each other, and join a club or class. Researchers have found strong social connections are healthier.

7. Give back – Find a cause you are passionate about and meaningfully contribute. It could be to a pet shelter, supporting the education of a needy child, environmental campaigns or volunteering your time towards a cause. By contributing to a larger purpose, not only are you being purposeful but also developing positive personality traits and experiences.
8. New Experiences – Doing something new positively stimulates the brain. Challenge yourself to do something new in 2023 that you haven’t done or experienced before. It could be in the comfort of your home or outside. All you need is an open mind and some enthusiasm!

Foster children can easily lose their first language – but giving it a place in daily life can make a big differencePremium Story,"Imagine a ten-year-old girl who has been through things no child should ever have to endure. She is told that there is a nice couple who will take care of her, but she’s heard that before, and has learned not to trust it.
She arrives at her new home, clutching her beloved skateboard like a security blanket. The chap who opens the door smiles and says, “I skate a bit, too.” Now imagine that English isn’t the mother tongue of the child in this scenario. She may have been going to school in the UK since she was four and speak English fluently. But she has another language, too, the one her parents spoke and that she said her first words in.
This language likely serves a similar function for that child as the skateboard in the John Lewis ad. It is both her security blanket and her superpower.Advertisement
ALSO READ | Five ways to help kids develop language skills at home
It is part of her identity, representing who she is and where she comes from. But it is also the particular gift that may have allowed her to facilitate daily life for her birth parents by acting as their translator – at the bank, at the doctor, with the teacher.
However, her new foster parents speak only English.
Children in this situation will almost certainly lose their first language. This loss may not occur not slowly and imperceptibly, a few words at a time, but with frightening speed and finality.
Language loss
Within a couple of months, they may struggle to recall basic words. Shortly after that, they are likely to need an interpreter to talk to family members. This fundamentally changes the already difficult child-parent relationship, threatening any sense of closeness and familiarity with birth parents or grandparents.
ALSO READ | Doctor in the House: Do you suspect speech delay in your child? Here are some tell-tale signs
We frequently see such developments in our ongoing research project at the University of York, in which we investigate the language experience of current and former foster children from homes where a language other than English was spoken, their caregivers, and their birth parents.Advertisement
Those involved with multilingual children in foster care often speak about how helpless they feel in the face of this deterioration, such an interpreter who was brought in to facilitate communication between a mother and her young son: It was quite heartbreaking watching this child … going from a very loving little boy with his mom, to the point where he just kept saying, I don’t understand you. … The mother couldn’t understand the child, the child couldn’t understand the mother. And after a while … I think that child then became really, really confused. It was a very sort of artificial conversation.
Research demonstrates the vulnerability of birth language knowledge. Ten-year-old children may be proficient and fluent speakers of their home language, but they forget it within months if they don’t use it daily.
Some studies have found that if they try to re-learn it later, they have virtually no advantage over adults who have no experience with that language, and who are learning it from scratch. This loss can have deep psychological consequences and cause a lasting sense of non-belonging, dislocation and shame.
ALSO READ | When should your child see a speech therapist? Here are some cues
Given the scarcity of resources, it is understandable that the British foster care system cannot easily accommodate the linguistic needs of the nearly 10 per cent of the population using one of more than 100 languages other than English as a main language.Advertisement
Protecting children from immediate physical or psychological harm by placing them in care understandably takes priority.
While local authorities may have guidance for foster carers looking after a child whose first language is not English, there is currently no national policy outlining if or what kind of support should be given to children who speak a minority home language.
Making a difference
When the language background of the child is taken into account and some sort of provision is made in the fostering environment, this may have enormous benefits for the relation between carer and child. It can also help the continued relationship between the child and their birth family.
ALSO READ | The Early Years: How to stimulate speech and language in the first three years
Even carers who are themselves not familiar with the language can do small things that mean a lot: reading books or watching films together, or giving the language a small place in daily life. Adopting some words for everyday household or food items, for instance, could serve to keep the door to the language open, and later facilitate re-learning.Advertisement
In terms of a “long-term commitment to the future of children in care”, this is an effort that is very much worthwhile. A simple thing such as saying the first words to the child in their own language as they arrives at the carer’s house can show that the foster parents understand its double role as their security blanket and superpower.
Plus, learning words in a new language is much less physically dangerous than taking up skateboarding.

"Farmers’ protest: Loan waiver among demands, how states have used it and Centre has held back, except twice","The demands of the farmers protesting at several places along the Punjab-Haryana border, with the agitation now spreading to other areas, include a waiver of farm loans.
Though this demand keeps raising its head, the fact is that the Central government has waived off farm loans only twice since Independence, and never given a blanket waiver. Waivers have primarily been a tool used by state governments, including as promises ahead of elections, particularly given the high levels of indebtedness among agricultural households.
Only two Central loan waivers to date
The first Central government loan waiver was under the Agricultural and Rural Debt Relief Scheme, introduced by the V P Singh-led National Front government in the 1990-91 Budget. The National Front had come to power then with the support of the BJP.Advertisement
“Over the years, poor farmers, artisans and weavers have accumulated debt which they are unable to repay. They have been caught up in a vicious circle of indebtedness and low incomes, which keeps them in perennial poverty. In order to relieve our farmers from the burden of debt, an assurance was given in the National Front’s manifesto that relief will be provided to farmers with loans up to Rs10,000,” announced Union Finance Minister Madhu Dandavate.
The Opposition, including the Congress, criticised the scheme during debates in Parliament, with some calling it a “mathematical somersault” and others saying the waiver was too small or targeted too few farmers.
ExplainSpeaking | Beyond MSPs and protests, some basic facts about Indian farmers
After an initial allocation of Rs 1,000 crore, the scheme ended up costing the government Rs 7,825 crore and necessitated additional loans from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for states to cover their share of the waiver. The scheme benefited 3.2 crore farmers, accounting for 53% of borrowers in the agricultural sector, and wiped away a third of the outstanding farm loans, as per a National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) report.
The next Central waiver came only 28 years later, in the 2008-09 Budget under the Manmohan Singh-led UPA I government. The Agriculture Debt Waiver and Relief Scheme sought to clear all overdue loans taken between 1997 and 2007 by farmers. While it offered a 100% waiver to small and marginal farmers, others were given relief up to Rs 25,000 or a 25% waiver (whichever was lower).Advertisement
The programme was significantly larger than the one in 1990 – it cost the government more than Rs 52,000 crore and is estimated to have benefited 3.7 crore farmers. It is also believed to have played a big role in the UPA’s return to power for a second term.
Ashok Gulati writes | Farmers' protest shows policies favour the consumer, not the producer
This time, the BJP that was in the Opposition joined the criticism of the scheme as “bad politics” and “bad economics”, and said it did not take into consideration a majority of the farmers, who did not have access to institutional credit or had taken loans unrelated to agriculture. While some questioned the quantum of the outlay, others said it wasn’t enough as not all farmers were eligible for a waiver.
Generally, economists have been critical of farm loan waivers, deeming them short-sighted solutions in the absence of long-lasting sector-wide reforms. Studies of farm loan waivers, including by the NABARD, show that even farmers who wouldn’t default on their loans otherwise are likely to do so in anticipation of future waivers. Research also suggests that waivers have little impact on improving productivity, investment, wages or consumption across the sector.
States frequently waive loans
While the Centre has rarely gone down this route, state governments have frequently used farm loan waivers for political gain before or during polls.Advertisement
Haryana, with a large agricultural population, was among the first to employ farm loan waivers. In 1987, the Lok Dal government led by Chaudhary Devi Lal that had just won the Assembly elections waived off up to Rs 10,000 in loans for every farmer, ignoring opposition by the Centre and RBI. To raise the funds, amounting to about Rs 228 crore (Rs 2,000 crore-plus, as per today’s prices) against a budgeted cost of Rs 60 crore, the state issued bonds and raised taxes. About 12 lakh farmers benefited from the scheme.
This gave impetus to other states and the Centre to follow suit, though with differing eligibility criteria for the loan waivers. In 1996, the DMK government in Tamil Nadu, for instance, waived off interest on the loans but not the principal sum.

The 2000s saw a spate of farm loan waiver programmes, including Kerala’s Farmers’ Debt Relief Commission Act, 2006, which is still active today. The Act, which was introduced during a period of high agricultural indebtedness and farmer suicides in state, empowers a committee to issue waivers, partial or complete, on a case-by-case basis including for non-institutional loans.
After a brief lull between the 2008 Central scheme and 2012, there have been at least 29 instances of state-level waivers. For some states, including Telangana and Tamil Nadu, waivers are almost an annual affair.Advertisement
 States that have implemented farm loan waivers since 1987
Loan waivers and poll impact
Though there is no clear correlation between the two, over the past decade, parties have generally won state elections after implementing or promising farm loan waivers ahead of polls. According to the NABARD database, between 1987 and 2020, parties that had announced or introduced a loan waiver scheme went on to lose only 4 elections out of 21.
More recently though, the promise of farm loan waivers or other farmer-related schemes alone has not been enough to win elections, despite farmers making up a sizeable chunk of the electorate in most states.
For example, in four of the five states that saw Assembly elections towards the end of 2023, while waivers were promised by parties in Madhya Pradesh and Telangana, other farmer-related programmes were promised by parties in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan.Advertisement

The then ruling Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) in Telangana even waived off loans amounting to Rs 5,800 crore for 16 lakh farmers months before the elections, but ended up losing to the Congress. The latter had promised an annual payment of Rs 15,000 to farmers and Rs 12,000 to farm labourers.
In Madhya Pradesh, the Congress revived its farm loan waiver promise from 2018, when it had won narrowly and held power briefly. Still, it could not stop the BJP’s landslide victory.
Notably, while the BJP has tended to stay away from such promises, in the months leading up to the polls in Madhya Pradesh, its government waived off interest on farmers’ loans, amounting to Rs 2,200 crore.
More than half of farming families in debt
The latest available data on farmers’ incomes and debts, from a National Statistical Office report dating back to 2019, found that the average agricultural household earned Rs 10,218 per month, compared to the national average per capita monthly income in 2018-19 of Rs 10,533.Advertisement
But earnings vary considerably depending on the size of the land holdings. Almost 70% of agricultural households have between 0.01 to 1 hectares of land, making them marginal farmers.
 Distribution of agricultural households by land holdings
For those with 0.01 to 0.4 hectares of land, the average monthly income is Rs 7,522, while those with 0.4 to 1 hectares of land, earn Rs 8,571 on average – both well below the average per capita income.
Farmers with holdings of more than 10 hectares earn an average Rs 60,758 per month, but they constitute only 0.4% of all agricultural households.
 Monthly income of agricultural households
The farmers with the smallest land holdings and the lowest monthly incomes also account for the largest chunk of indebted households. Those with holdings between 0.01 and 1 hectares account for 62.2% of indebted agricultural households. While the average debt for all agricultural households stood at Rs 74,121 in 2019, families with 0.01 to 0.4 hectares of land had outstanding loans of Rs 33,220 and those with 0.4 to 1 hectares of land had outstanding loans of Rs 51,933. Overall, 50.2% of farming households are in debt.Advertisement
 Indebtedness of agricultural households
Under the Modi govt
While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not introduced a farm loan waiver in his two terms in power, one of his government’s flagship schemes is PM Kisan Samman Nidhi (or PM KISAN). Launched in 2018, months ahead of the 2019 general elections, the PM-KISAN scheme ensures three instalments of Rs 2,000 every year to farmers with land holding of up to 2 hectares.
Modi targeted the Opposition and made it a point to differentiate it from the previous Congress government’s farm loan waiver scheme, saying: “Yeh saare maha-milawati log aise hi hain. Congress ho, SP ho, BSP ho, inke saare chele-chapate hon. Woh kya karte hain? Bas 10 saal mein ek baar unko kisan yaad aata hai (These people, be it in the Congress, SP, BSP, or their associates, these mish-mash of parties, what do they do? They remember farmers only once in 10 years)… Then they start getting the fever of waiving off loans. They have learnt the gimmick of giving lollipops and getting votes by cheating farmers,” he said.
Incidentally, the Modi government’s PM-KISAN scheme followed the Congress’s win in the December 2018 Assembly polls in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, where it had promised farm loan waivers.
In the first disbursement under PM KISAN, 3.2 crore farmers received a total of Rs 6,323 crore. At its peak in 2021-22 (the Covid period), more than 10 crore farmers got Rs 67,032 crore for the year. In the latest disbursement last November, 8.1 crore farmers received Rs 18,610 crore.",politics
Saleem Shervani interview: I don’t understand why Akhilesh so shy of using the word Muslim… I kept telling him,"Former Union minister and five-time MP Saleem Shervani has resigned as the Samajwadi Party (SP) national general secretary, accusing party president Akhilesh Yadav of “ignoring” the PDA communities. The PDA acronym, coined by Akhilesh himself, stands for Pichda (backwards), Dalits and Alpasankhyak (minorities). In his resignation letter sent to Akhilesh on Sunday, Shervani, 70, asked how the SP was different from the BJP and that the party’s candidates for the February 27 Rajya Sabha elections did not have a Muslim name. In an interview with The Indian Express, Shervani speaks about these issues and his next moves. Excerpts:
Why did you resign from your Samajwadi Party post?
For a long time, I had been telling Akhilesh Yadav ji that the distance between Muslims and the party has been increasing, that we don’t raise our voice enough for the community, 80-90% of which voted for the SP (in the 2022 UP Assembly polls). I am not talking about criminals, but innocent citizens are facing hardships like bulldozer action, mosque demolitions, youngsters being sent to jail in a wrongful manner… Even after he (Akhilesh) announced PDA as our main pitch for the Lok Sabha polls, when he declared the party’s candidates for the Rajya Sabha, we saw that “P” and “A” got no representation.
Do you think the SP doesn’t talk about issues pertaining to the Muslim community?Advertisement
Today, the atmosphere in the country is such that anyone who raises rightful issues of the Muslims, are branded as anti-national. The parties are scared over vote-bank politics. I have said this on TV that if I feel safe in this country, it is because of the majority Hindu community… No one is raising genuine issues pertaining to the Muslim community, including the SP.

Did you feel neglected within the party?
I was included in meetings of the party. I had full hope that I would get a Rajya Sabha nomination. I didn’t raise my voice when the party didn’t give me a Rajya Sabha ticket the last time, because Javed Ali Sahab got one. This time too, if it had nominated a Muslim candidate, I wouldn’t have said anything. I don’t understand why he (Akhilesh) is so shy of using the word Muslim.
Before you resigned, senior leader Swami Prasad Maurya also did the same, while MLA Pallavi Patel expressed disappointment with the party leadership too… How do you see it?Advertisement
Yes, everyone has the same issue. That you have stepped away from the PDA communities, after giving the slogan.
You are still a member of the SP and have only resigned as its national general secretary. What is your future plan?
When I had joined (SP), I had come with thousands of supporters. Now, I will take a call after I consult them.
How do you see Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s Yatra in UP? Are you considering joining the Congress?Advertisement
I have been approached by some people in the Congress and some in the BSP. A senior SP leader has also said he will meet me to discuss things. I have not said no to anyone, but my condition is that I will hold talks with the top leadership… I will meet all my supporters and make a decision soon. In my view, Rahul Gandhi ji’s Yatra is a great step. So many people are joining it. How many vote for the party is something we will have to wait and watch. It is a commendable effort by him to try and unite the country.
Will you join Rahul’s Yatra when it reaches western UP?
I have got a call from the party to join the Yatra, but I need to discuss it with my supporters first… If Rahul ji calls me, I will go. Same for Akhilesh ji and Mayawati ji. I want to know who will raise the genuine issues of the community.",politics
"Decode Politics: As farmer protests continue, how the ground is shifting for Punjab parties","The renewed farmers’ protest demanding a legal guarantee for Minimum Support Price (MSP) has made political parties alter their strategies, especially with the Lok Sabha elections just round the corner.
The idea of the protest, which was called by the Kisan Mazdoor Morcha (KMM), an umbrella organisation of over 100 farmer unions, and the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (Non-Political), originated in Punjab, where as of now the four main political parties — the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Congress, BJP and Akali Dal (SAD) — are all separately in the poll race.
The AAP in Punjab is trying to project itself as the party that is the “friend of the farmers”, with its Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann playing mediator in the Centre-farmer talks. The Congress, with nothing to lose and having had an amicable parting with the AAP at least in Punjab, has also lent support to the farmers’ demands, with its leaders visiting farmers injured in the protests. The BJP, which is in power at both the Centre and in Haryana (that has been using strongarm tactics to keep farmers from their plan of marching to Delhi) is doing its bit to ensure the farmers are not totally alienated from the party. It’s the Akalis, who are struggling to revive the party, who seem to be the most affected, with their “Punjab Bachao Yatra” on the backburner due to the protests and the prospects of an alliance with old partner BJP now bleak.
The lucky break for ruling AAPAdvertisement
The AAP government in Punjab has had its share of run-ins with farmers over a host of issues, and the Centre turning to Mann to act as mediator is clearly a god sent for the party. Some believe the AAP is trying to distract attention from its own problems vis-a-vis the farmers via the ongoing protest. But party spokesperson Manwinder Singh Kang denies this, saying: “At present, the farmers’ demands are related to the Centre and our CM is only trying to get their voices heard.”
Mann has played a key role since the KMM, on February 6, sent an email to the Centre on its Dilli Chalo call. KMM coordinator Sarvan Singh Pandher says they had a meeting with officials in the Haryana government as well, but were told no BJP ministers were free to meet them till February 14. On the other hand, Pandher says, Mann approached them, had an online meeting with them on February 7 and then facilitated their talks with three Union ministers – Arjun Munda, Piyush Goyal and Nityananda Rai — on the farmers’ demands.

The KMM’s first meeting with the three ministers on February 8 at the Mahatma Gandhi State Institute of Public Administration in Chandigarh was also reportedly facilitated by Mann.
Digvijay Pal Sharma, the president of the Democratic Teachers’ Front (DTF), which has also been protesting against the AAP government over issues such as unemployment and lack of hiring, says Mann has managed to shift the entire focus on the Centre. He points to the fact that a February 24 “Chalo Chandigarh” march called by the Bharti Kisan Union-Ekta Ugrahan, against the AAP government, has now been put off indefinitely.Advertisement
The farmers’ protest has also given the AAP an opportunity to publicise its government’s “AAP di sarkar, AAP de dwar (AAP’s government at your doorstep)” initiative, via outreach camps. The party has also expressed sympathy with the family of the 23-year-old farmer Shubhkarman, who was killed. Mann has also announced strict punishment to the guilty.
A window of opportunity for Congress
The Congress, which finished second in the 2022 Assembly polls, has thrown its weight behind the farmers, with party chief Mallikarjun Kharge repeatedly saying that a legal guarantee for MSP would be part of the party’s manifesto for the Lok Sabha elections.
With the AAP and Congress “mutually deciding” to fight the Lok Sabha polls separately in Punjab, despite being constituents of the Opposition INDIA bloc, the support of the farmers is all the more important for the grand old party.
Also Read | As Congress backs farmers’ MSP demand, what has the govt committee set up in 2022 done so far?
Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh Raja Warring has termed the farmers’ demands as “genuine” and has been reaching out to the injured ones. The party, sources said, wants to ensure that the people do not forget the Congress’s crucial support to the farmers’ agitation in 2020-2021, though it failed to benefit them electorally in the subsequent Punjab Assembly polls.
The BJP’s gambitAdvertisement
Before the protests began, the BJP was seen as looking to revive its fortunes in the state, where it will face the Lok Sabha elections without an alliance with the Akali Dal after a long time, with few giving it much of a chance. Its prospects seemed somewhat brighter after the Ram Temple consecration, which appeared to have resonated with the Hindu community of the state.
Given the clampdown by the BJP government in Haryana on the protesters, the Akalis will find it hard — at least for now — to join hands with it. The state leaders who are apprehensive of a farmer backlash have been talking in multiple voices. While former CM and ex-Congress leader Amarinder Singh met Prime Minister Narendra Modi this week to present the farmers’ cause, its Punjab unit chief Sunil Jakhar has been openly critical of Mann’s role in the negotiations.
Since the police action on protesters at the Shambhu border on February 21, farmers have camped outside the houses of at least 20 BJP leaders, including Jakhar. Many of these leaders now claim to have “befriended” the protesters, claiming that “it is the right of farmers to get themselves heard”.
Also Read | Unlike 2020-21, why BJP is unruffled by farmers’ protests this time around
The Centre has had five rounds of talks with the farmer leaders, including one on Wednesday night. But the farmers rejected the Centre’s last offer — to bring five crops under a diversification plan and procure them under MSP.Advertisement
Sources in the party said that the BJP, however, is not too wary of a fallout. First, it sees this as significant that the Samyukta Kisan Morcha – the flagship organisation of over 500 farmer unions, which played a key role in the agitation against the now-repealed farm laws — is not a part of the protest. While distant earlier, the SKM, though, has jumped in now after the Haryana crackdown, and has been holding separate protests in as many as 59 locations across Punjab since February 17, condemning the police action and supporting farmers’ demands.
Second, while BJP insiders admit the protests made for “bad optics”, they are confident of a “counter-polarisation” in Haryana and west Uttar Pradesh in favour of the party. Many BJP leaders have raised questions over the timing of the protests and asked why the farmers were “sparing” the AAP government.
The Akali Dal’s struggles
After 30 farmers were left injured at the Shambhu border after the first round of farmer protests, the Akalis announced that they were putting off their Punjab Bachao Yatra, an ambitious programme planned to revive the party after the 2020 Assembly poll drubbing. Party insiders say it will also be difficult now to stitch an alliance with the BJP, at a time when its rural vote bank is turning against the Centre.

However, Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal has kept a door open. While he has asked the Centre to consider the farmers’ demands and condemned the Haryana government for its action against the protesters, his attacks on the AAP government have been more fierce. He has repeatedly slammed the Mann government for not fulfilling its poll promise of giving MSP on all crops.Advertisement
Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal said: “If the Centre is not giving (MSP), why can’t the state government do it? They had promised to give it within five minutes of forming the government.”

Today in Politics: PM Modi in Ahmedabad for Amul golden jubilee; farm stir spirals over protester death,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going to attend the golden jubilee celebrations of the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), which owns the ‘Amul’ brand, in Ahmedabad on Thursday and will unveil five projects worth Rs 1,200 crore.
The GCMMF’s vision for the next 25 years will also be discussed at the function, said the federation’s managing director Jayen Mehta.
The event, being held at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, is expected see the participation of more than 1.25 lakh dairy farmers from around 18,600 villages in Gujarat. Mehta said 40-45 per cent of the dairy farmers in the audience will be women.Advertisement
The GCMMF, set up in 1973, has an annual turnover of Rs 61,000 crore and 36.4 lakh farmers among milk producers of the 18 district dairy unions under it.
The PM will inaugurate five new dairy projects: modern cheese plant of Sabar Dairy, which has come up with an investment of Rs 600 crore; a long-life tetra pak milk plant of Amul Dairy at Anand; the expansion of its chocolate plant; a 50,000-litre ice cream plant of Sarhad Dairy in Kutch; and a unit of Bharuch Dairy coming up in Mumbai.
In context: While the GCMMF is a non-political body, its control over the last couple of years has been with the ruling BJP. Most of the 18 dairy unions that are members of the GCMMF are under the BJP’s control. Shankar Chaudhary, the Gujarat Assembly Speaker, continues to be the chairman of Banas Dairy, while Jetha Bharwad, Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Panchmahal Dairy, continues to head the district cooperatives.
When R S Sodhi quit as MD of the body last January, after more than a decade at the helm, some said it was because he did not toe the political line. “Two decades ago, leaders of the milk unions in Gujarat were aligned with the Congress. Now the baton has passed on to the BJP,” a former member of the GCMMF had told The Indian Express earlier.
Farmer protests simmerAdvertisement
On Wednesday, as agitating Punjab farmers resumed their “Dilli Chalo” march to seek a legal guarantee of minimum support price (MSP) for their crops as well as debt waiver, among other demands, a 22-year-old farmer, Shubhkaran Singh, died and several protesters were injured as the Haryana police allegedly hurled teargas shells and fired rubber bullets at the Khanauri and Shambhu borders between Punjab and Haryana.
After this incident, Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) leader Sarvan Singh Pandher, who is among farmer leaders spearheading the stir, announced the suspension of their “Dilli Chalo” march for two days until Friday.
To express their outrage over the death of Shubhkaran Singh, Haryana Bhartiya Kisan Union (Chaduni) chief Gurnam Singh Chaduni has given a call to block one or two roads in each of the districts in Haryana for two hours — 12 noon to 2 pm — on Thursday.
Chaduni has urged the farmers to maintain peace and avoid any confrontation with the police during their road blockade. He has also urged the truckers and other commuters to extend their support to the agitation.Advertisement
Earlier on Wednesday, Union Agriculture Minister Arjun Munda called for peace, urging farmer protesters to return to the negotiation table. “After the fourth round (of talks), the government is ready to discuss all issues like the MSP demand, crop diversification, stubble issue and FIRs (against farmers). I again invite the farmer leaders for discussion. It is important for us to maintain peace,” Munda said.
It remains to be seen how the farmers’ agitation will proceed further. The farm leaders would hold a meeting on Friday evening to take stock of the situation and decide their next course of action.
Meanwhile, in a Wednesday night development, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), headed by PM Modi, approved a hike in the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane by Rs 25 to Rs 340 per quintal for 2024-25 season.
The FRP of sugarcane has been hiked from Rs 315 per quintal to Rs 340 per quintal at a basic recovery rate of 10.25 per cent. The new price is about 8 per cent higher than the FRP of sugarcane for the current season of 2023-’24. The revised FRP will be applicable from October 1. The Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) is the minimum price that mills have to pay to sugarcane growers.
Amit Shah in ChhattisgarhAdvertisement
Union Home Minister Amit Shah will kick off the BJP’s campaign for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls in Chhattisgarh by addressing a public rally in Janjgir Champa on Thursday.
In the November 2023 Assembly polls, the BJP defeated the incumbent Congress by winning 54 seats out of 90 as against the latter’s 35 seats. The Congress however swept all the seats in the Janjgir Champa belt.
During his visit, Shah will also hold a meeting with the BJP leaders and workers in the state. Of the 11 Lok Sabha seats in the state, the BJP won nine as against the Congress’s two in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

"Mayawati aloof, left to own devices, BSP MPs weigh options","WITH THE Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) not part of any alliance in Uttar Pradesh, and absent from the poll buzz, several of its MPs apprehensive of their prospects are believed to be in touch with other parties.
The BSP had won 10 seats from Uttar Pradesh in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the maximum after the BJP. Of them, Ghazipur MP Afzal Ansari has already taken the Samajwadi Party ticket from the seat, while Amroha MP Danish Ali was suspended by the party and is believed to be set to join the Congress after attending the launch of Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra from Manipur.
Incidentally, as part of its arrangement with the SP declared on Wednesday, the Congress is set to contest Amroha. Ali has been active on the ground in anticipation.Advertisement
With Mayawati inaccessible, the remaining eight sitting MPs of the BSP are unsure if they will even be re-fielded by the party. Sources said the MPs are yet to be contacted by the party organisation as part of election preparations.
Asked about the party’s MPs looking at other parties, including the SP, BJP and Congress, its central coordinator Ramji Gautam declined to comment.
A BSP MP said, “I am not even being called for organisation meetings, like ongoing cadre camps. So, I have to look for options.”
Opinion | Why Rahul Gandhi’s politics is that of the BSP
The BSP MP from Jaunpur, Shyam Singh Yadav, had joined Rahul Gandhi’s first Bharat Jodo Yatra, in December 2022, and walked with him for about three hours as it crossed Delhi. Yadav later said he had joined the Yatra in his “individual capacity”, on the invitation of Rahul.Advertisement
In December last year, Yadav also issued an appeal to parties including the BSP to unite against the BJP, again calling it his personal opinion. Mayawati has been saying that the BSP did not intend to join the INDIA bloc – despite the Congress’s keenness to include the party – as well as the NDA.
Asked about his plans for the Lok Sabha polls, Yadav declined to comment.
According to sources, at least one BSP MP was in touch with the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), before it announced its decision to join the NDA. Another BSP MP, from eastern UP, is believed to be in touch with the BJP. The MP is believed to have helped the BJP in the Ghosi Assembly bypoll last year, though the party eventually lost to the SP.
Aides of another MP who is reportedly also waiting for a confirmation from the BJP said he has started setting up a parallel organisation of workers going down to the booth level in his constituency, after waiting fruitlessly for the BSP to get in touch. This is to ensure that even if the BJP does not give him a ticket, he can contest as an Independent, the aides said.Advertisement
Asked whether they were facing the same problem of the party organisation not being in touch with sitting MPs, the husband of Sangeeta Azad, the BSP MP from Lalganj, said: “Behanji (Mayawati) has her own rules and principles and she works accordingly.”
Asked whether Sangeeta will contest on the BSP symbol, Azad Arimaradan, a former MLA, dodged a direct reply, saying: “She is the whip of the party.”
Notably, the couple met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in December last year in New Delhi, with a memorandum seeking a Vande Bharat train.
Asked about his plans, BSP Ambedkar Nagar MP Ritesh Pandey said: “Right now, I am where I am. And I am awaiting the orders of my leader (Mayawati).”Advertisement
A party leader said that the general opinion within the BSP was that an alliance helps the party in elections by getting it voters outside its traditional base of Jatav Dalits, and that a large section was for a tie-up with either the INDIA or NDA.
With the BSP’s electoral fortunes on the decline since 2012, its 10 seats in 2019 – marking a revival – had come in alliance with the SP and RLD. In comparison, in 2014, the BSP had drawn a blank.
After the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BSP had parted ways with the SP and fought the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls in 2022 alone. It had won just 1 seat and a vote share of just over 12%.",politics
"The Kamal Nath puzzle: Son welcomes CM to family turf, local Cong leaders join BJP in bulk","A DAY AFTER senior Congress leader Kamal Nath attended a meeting on Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra to take stock of preparations for it, several Congress leaders from his stronghold of Chhindwara switched to the BJP Wednesday.
Chief Minister Mohan Yadav, who attended the function where “more than 1,500” Congress leaders joined the BJP, as per his office, was welcomed to Chhindwara by Kamal Nath son’s Nakul Nath. The Chhindwara MP, Nakul urged Yadav to ensure early funds for the district and for the Chhindwara Medical College.
In a post on X, Nakul also hoped that the BJP government in the state would improve facilities at Chhindwara University, and help the district’s farmers who had lost crops to excessive rains.Advertisement

Yadav’s visit, which included a road show with local BJP leaders, came days after rumours that Kamal Nath and Nakul were ready to leave the Congress for the party. Kamal Nath, a former CM and the state Congress chief, did not deny or confirm the rumours.
The Congress leaders who joined the BJP Wednesday included its state unit general secretary Ajay Singh Ajju Thakur; Congress regional leader Pradeep Junankar; and several members of local civic bodies. BJP leaders in Chhindwara said that with the leaders joining the party, “all the municipalities in the Chhindwara Lok Sabha seat are under the BJP’s control”.

A leader credited the development to the efforts of BJP district president Vivek Bunty Sahu.
Addressing the people during the road show, Yadav said: “The love that Chhindwara is giving and the wind that is blowing here, I congratulate you in advance. This time Hanumanji’s mace will swing, and victory will be achieved in favour of the BJP. No power can stop this… I welcome you all into the BJP family. Our family is growing and it is a sign, which must be understood. This is the time of Narendra Modi, the most popular Prime Minister.”Advertisement
Referring to the fact that the only seat the Congress won in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections was Chhindwara, the CM asked the crowds: “Last time, we didn’t get only Chhindwara. This time can I depend on you? Should I keep my faith in Chhindwara?”

Promising development for Madhya Pradesh, Yadav, who replaced long-serving BJP leader Shivraj Singh Chouhan as CM, said: “No welfare schemes will be stopped, from Laadli Laxmi (started by Chouhan) to other schemes… Every single promise in the manifesto will be implemented.”
Rumours that Congress veteran Kamal Nath, a nine-time MP from Chhindwara before he moved to the state and took over as party chief, could leave the party have been around for some time. They resurfaced after the Congress didn’t nominate Kamal Nath for the coming Rajya Sabha polls, and were fanned by his sudden trip to New Delhi on Saturday, cutting short a tour of Chhindwara.
However, Kamal Nath spent his time in the Capital closeted with his supporters, who later dismissed rumours that he would join the BJP.",politics
"In UP booster for INDIA, SP and Congress stitch up alliance; Priyanka call to Akhilesh ‘deal clincher’","After weeks of tense negotiations and hard bargaining, the INDIA alliance partners Samajwadi Party (SP) and Congress finalised their seat-sharing pact in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.
Under their agreement for UP, the Congress will contest 17 seats out of 80 in the state, leaving the remaining 63 seats for the SP and its smaller allies.
In MP, the Congress has agreed to allot the Khajuraho seat to the SP and will field its candidates from the remaining 28 constituencies in the state.Advertisement
Congress sources said that All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra played a “crucial role” in resolving the standoff between the two INDIA parties by speaking with SP national president Akhilesh Yadav over the phone to clinch the deal.
The SP-Congress seat-sharing pact would come as a shot in the arm to the beleaguered INDIA bloc which has been lurching from crisis to crisis.

“Following our discussion, it has been decided that the Congress would contest 17 seats in UP. On the remaining 63 seats, Samajwadi Party and other parties of INDIA bloc would declare their candidates to fight and defeat BJP,” AICC general secretary Avinash Pande told a joint press conference along with UP Congress chief Ajay Rai, state SP chief Naresh Uttam and SP national spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary.
While thanking AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge and Akhilesh, Pandey highlighted Priyanka’s role in forging their alliance, saying it proved to be “decisive”. “We would specially like to thank Priyanka Gandhi ji for playing a crucial role in finalising the alliance and for her efforts to bring all such forces together which can defeat BJP,” he said.Advertisement
The 17 seats allotted to the Congress include Raebareli, Amethi, Kanpur, Fatehpur Sikri, Bansgaon, Saharanpur, Prayagraj, Maharajganj, Varanasi, Amroha, Jhansi, Bulandshahr, Ghaziabad, Mathura, Sitapur, Barabanki and Deoria.
While Varanasi is Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s constituency, Raebareli and Amethi are among the few remaining strongholds of the Congress in UP. In the 2019 polls, Rahul Gandhi lost from Amethi to the BJP’s Smriti Irani, while Sonia Gandhi retained her Raebareli seat.
Sonia has now bid farewell to electoral politics and her Raebareli seat, deciding to file nomination for the February 27 Rajya Sabha polls from Rajasthan. She is likely to be replaced by Priyanka, her daughter, as the Congress candidate from Raebareli.
The SP will retain the Lucknow and Faizabad seats along with most of the constituencies in the western UP region barring Saharanpur, Mathura, Ghaziabad and Bulandshahr.Advertisement
Naresh Uttam said, “For social harmony in the country and to end social and economic inequality, Samajwadi Party and Congress have decided seat-sharing,” adding that Akhilesh would decide the candidates in 63 seats left for the SP under the deal.
Ajay Rai said, “The way our leader Priyanka Gandhi is working hard, it has given us strength and we will make all efforts to fight from the 17 seats.”
On Akhilesh’s statement that he would join Rahul’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, which is currently traversing UP, only after the conclusion of his party’s seat-sharing with the Congress, Pande said the SP supremo had said earlier that he would join the Yatra in Amethi or Raebareli. He said since the Yatra has crossed these two belts and would now resume
from west UP on February 24, the Congress has informed the SP about Rahul’s route map ahead. Akhilesh would now decide about his plan to join the Yatra, he added.Advertisement

"Farmer protests ‘politically motivated’, MSP law demand ‘unreasonable’, says RSS-linked magazine","As protesting farmers try to break through police barricades at the Shambhu border in Haryana to reach Delhi, the latest issue of the RSS-affiliated magazine The Organiser has called their demands for a legal guarantee of MSP “unreasonable”, and called their protests “politically motivated”. This is in sharp contrast to the Sangh’s earlier stance of supporting the agitating farmers’ demand.
The magazine also sought to link the Sandeshkhali incident in West Bengal to “sex slavery” inspired by the ISIS.
“The farmers’ agitation that we witnessed around Delhi in 2020 was in the context of three Bills related to reforms in the agricultural sector. This time around, there is no such reason,” said an editorial of the magazine penned by its editor Prafulla Ketkar.Advertisement
Suggesting that the farm stir was political in nature, the editorial said, “The modus operandi is the same – massive mobilisation and blockade of roads with unreasonable demands such as legal guarantees related to Minimum Support Price (MSP) for all crops, loan waivers and pensions for all farmers to withdraw from the World Trade Organisation. Some are also raising the sensitive and provocative issue of Khalistan.”

Ketkar argued that following the 2020 protests, the Union government had announced MSP on various crops, and kept engaging with the farmer bodies.
“Even when negotiations are ongoing, the kind of mobilisation that is taking place, not just to draw attention but also to obstruct traffic on roads, is undemocratic. In the popular perception, opposition parties are fueling this protest to create an anti-government atmosphere. Using farmers in this political game undermines the genuine concerns of the agriculture sector,” Ketkar further said.
Opinion | The jeera lesson: How Modi government can give farmer MSP, and fulfil its goals
The editorial concluded that the farm agitation along with the Haldwani protest and the opposition to probing the Sandeshkhali incident were part of “a larger game to disrupt and demean democracy”.Advertisement
Last week, the RSS’s farmer wing, the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), had criticised the “violent protests” by farmers, but supported their demand for MSP. “We reiterate that remunerative prices based on (input) cost is the farmers’ right, and they should get it,” the BKS said in a statement.
Interestingly, the BKS had earlier supported the idea of a law that guarantees MSP to farmers. In its suggestions to the government on the now-repealed farm laws in September 2020, it had stressed that traders must be mandated to buy produce from farmers at prices not less than the MSP. “If MSP can’t be included in these Bills, the government should bring another law,” BKS general secretary Dinesh Kulkarni had told The Indian Express.
The cover story of the issue is the alleged sexual harassment case in Sandeshkhali. The report, written by Rajarshi Roychowdhury, starts with a brief description of the atrocities unleashed by the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq on women, where they were turned into spoils of war and used as sex slaves.
It then says, “Fast forward to 2024; moving from Syria to Sandeshkhali, medievalism and barbarity of the ISIS variety is getting perpetuated within the very borders of India.”Advertisement
Suggesting that the incident was a conspiracy allegedly hatched by a Muslim politician (TMC leader Sheikh Shahjahan) against Hindu women, the report says, “The women of Sandeshkhali had been turned into objects cheaper than commodities for Shahjahan and his accomplices to use and throw at their will. The grotesque saga of Sandeshkhali is unfolding with women speaking up about the unimaginable abuse they had to face. These helpless women would invariably be Hindus but never Muslim.”
The article also suggests that Shahjahan has done this as part of a modus operandi. “The first is to settle a large number of Rohingyas from across the porous Bangladesh border to permanently alter the demographic profile of Sandeshkhali, which in turn would help him (Shahjahan) turn the criminal-minded Rohingyas into his private militia,” it alleges.",politics
"In boost to BJP in Odisha, former Naveen aide joins party","The BJP’s Odisha unit got a shot in the arm ahead of the simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly polls after expelled BJD leader and Gopalpur MLA Pradeep Panigrahy joined the party on Wednesday.
The three-time MLA, once considered to be the blue-eyed boy of Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, was expelled from the BJD for “anti-people” activities in November 2020. Since then, he has been facing multiple cases of alleged corruption and cheating. BJP state president Manmohan Samal claimed Panigrahy has been a “victim of various political situations”, alleging vendetta politics.
Welcoming the 60-year-old to the party, Samal said Panigrahy’s entry will strengthen the BJP in the Ganjam district, a BJD stronghold and bastion of CM Patnaik. Ganjam, within which Panigrahy’s Gopalpur seat falls, is the state’s most populous district, with 2 Lok Sabha and 13 Assembly seats. The BJP is yet to announce which seat Panigrahy will contest from, whether in the Lok Sabha or Assembly polls.Advertisement
Panigrahy’s induction into the BJP comes a day before Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh is scheduled to address a rally in the Gopalpur constituency.
The Gopalpur MLA, who has been targeting Patnaik and his close aide V K Pandian since he was dismissed from the BJD, mounted a fresh attack immediately after joining the BJP. “A lot of development has taken place in the country under the leadership of PM Modi. The world is today looking at India because of Modiji’s leadership. Time has come for a change in Odisha and to throw away the corrupt government. We will work with the ‘Odia first’ approach,” Panigrahy told reporters.

Considering Panigrahy’s clout, the BJP aims to cut into the BJD’s votes in several Assembly seats. As the BJD’s face in Ganjam for several years, Panigrahy also has a deep understanding of the grassroots-level political equations, through which the BJP hopes to gain ground in Patnaik’s home turf.
“Because of the BJD’s misrule, people have started reposing their faith in the BJP and in the leadership of Narendra Modiji. During the last panchayat and municipality polls, our party also did well in the urban areas. Panigrahy joining will help us,” a BJP leader said.Advertisement
Panigrahy’s history with the BJD
However, labelling the Gopalpur MLA as “tainted”, Ganjam BJD president Ramesh Chandra Chyau Patnaik said “people are not with him because of his involvement in corruption”.
Of the 13 Assembly seats in Ganjam, the BJD won 12 and the Congress 1 in the 2019 polls. The BJP, however, finished second in all 12 seats the BJD won and third in the other seat despite putting up a tough fight in constituencies like Bhanjanagar, Polsara, Surada, Gopalpur and Chikiti. In 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP had also finished second to the BJD in both Ganjam seats, Aska and Berhampur.odia
In the 2009 polls, Panigrahy was first elected to the state Assembly from Gopalpur, which he held in 2014 and 2019. In all three polls, Panigrahy secured more than 40% of the vote share and managed to hit 45.7% in 2019. Panigrahy was also a minister in Patnaik’s Cabinet.
Until his expulsion in 2020, Panigrahy had been among the few BJD leaders with direct access to Patnaik. But his relationship with the CM turned sour after he raised questions over the government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic in Ganjam. He also wrote multiple letters to the CM alleging the government was ignoring suggestions from the local MLAs. Panigrahy’s fallout with Pandian in particular is believed to have been a key reason behind his dismissal from the BJD.Advertisement
Days after he was expelled from the BJD, he was arrested by the Odisha Police on charges of forgery, fraud and criminal conspiracy and accused of duping several job aspirants on the pretence of giving them employment in Tata Motors. He was released in June 2021 after spending just over seven months in jail.
The vigilance wing of the Odisha government also registered a case against Panigrahy in October 2021, under the Prevention of Corruption Act, for the alleged possession of disproportionate assets.",politics
"Real estate baron Kupendra Reddy’s entry stirs Karnataka Rajya Sabha pot, Congress prepares for the heat","HE MAY have slim prospects of victory, but the entry of multi-millionaire real estate baron D Kupendra Reddy in the Rajya Sabha poll fray in Karnataka means there are now five candidates for four seats, forcing an election on February 27. The 63-year-old, who declared Rs 1,200 crore assets in his election affidavit, has been fielded by the JD(S)-BJP combine, in what is seen as a bid to test the unity and resolve of the state’s ruling Congress.
As numbers stand in the Karnataka Assembly, the Congress is assured of three seats, and the BJP of one.
“The cat has been set among the pigeons. The move is to create confusion in Congress ranks, as there are many disgruntled individuals and divisions in the party that can be exploited,” a senior leader in the JD(S)-BJP alliance said.Advertisement
Ironically, in the 2022 Rajya Sabha polls, it had been cross-voting by two JD(S) MLAs that had caused the surprise defeat of Reddy, then a JD(S) candidate. JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy is believed to be still smarting from the loss of his close aide, which happened when the Congress did not transfer its excess votes to Reddy, and instead fielded an extra candidate, Mansoor Ali Khan. The BJP’s dark horse Lahar Singh won the seat after two JDS MLAs cross-voted, and later joined the Congress.
Each Rajya Sabha candidate needs at least 45 votes in the 224-MLA Karnataka Assembly to win a Rajya Sabha seat from the state. The Congress with 135 MLAs has the exact number to elect its three candidates — Ajay Maken, a central Congress leader seen as the choice of the high command; Nasir Hussain, a confidant of Mallikarjun Kharge; and party faithful G C Chandrashekhar. Party sources said they were also confident of the support of three Independents.
The BJP has 66 MLAs, which means it can easily get its main candidate, party worker Narayansa Bhandage, elected, with votes to spare. Combined with the 19 JD(S) MLAs, this means enough votes to help Reddy win, provided he can win over the three Independents and get at least three Congress MLAs to cross-vote. This is where his money power could play a big role.
Congress chief and Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar alleged this week that Kumaraswamy had approached a few Congress MLAs on behalf of the “fifth candidate of the JD(S)-BJP”. “We know who he is calling, what he is saying and who he is threatening. Our MLAs have told us about the offers they have received. We are also aware of the BJP’s strategy,” Shivakumar said.Advertisement
Reddy has also been associated with the Congress earlier, having contested a 2008 Assembly poll on its ticket. In recent years, though, he has always been seen on Kumaraswamy’s side, including at the alliance meetings with BJP leaders like Amit Shah and J P Nadda for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.
A land and IT park developer, Reddy has connections across parties, and owns multiple businesses in Bengaluru, ranging from high-end car sales to real estate. He was the owner of the Mysore cricket team in the Karnataka Premier League, for which he bid under the name of his car sale business, Sirish Automobiles, in 2008, bagging it for Rs 3.25 crore.
The long history of cross-voting in Karnataka Rajya Sabha polls includes the 2016 incident when eight of the JD(S)’s 40 MLAs voted for a Congress candidate to defeat the JD(S)’s wealthy candidate B M Farook. The MLAs were later suspended. Many are now Congress MLAs.
BJP sources said one of the reasons why its MP and Union Minister of State Rajeev Chandrashekhar, himself a wealthy businessman and one of Karnataka’s four retiring Rajya Sabha MPs, is not trying re-entry into the Upper House from the state, is the party’s lack of faith in the JD(S). Chandrashekhar is tipped to contest the Lok Sabha polls instead.Advertisement
A Congress leader alluded to the JD(S) history of cross-voting to say: “On February 27, many of its MLAs will do cross-voting. It is the JD(S) that will be in trouble again, not the Congress.
Congress leaders added that CM Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar, who are known to have differences, had put these aside to ensure a united front for the polls.",politics
"West UP back on Rahul Gandhi’s Yatra map, but will skirt RLD strongholds","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has yet again tweaked his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra’s route and included five districts of west Uttar Pradesh, a region which he had decided to skip following the exit of the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) – seen to be influential in the region – from the INDIA bloc.
Congress general secretary in-charge (communications) Jairam Ramesh on Wednesday said the yatra will resume on February 24 from Moradabad, after a two-day break, and head to Sambhal, Aligarh, Hathras and Agra (all in west UP) before moving on to Dholpur in Rajasthan. Sources said Rahul will cover the five districts in a day as he wants to “save time”.
It was also announced that there would be a break in the Yatra from February 26 to March 1, when Rahul will head to Cambridge University in the UK to “fulfil his long-standing commitment” to deliver two special lectures.Advertisement

The districts in west UP which Rahul will tour have a significant population of Muslims. While Jats are dominant in Moradabad, Dalits make up a key part of the population in Hathras and Agra. Rahul will skip constituencies like Baghpat, Mathura, Kairana, Muzaffarnagar, Bijnor, Nagina and Amroha, where the RLD is said to be influential. He will not travel to Hamirpur and Jhansi either, which was scheduled earlier.
Moradabad and Sambhal, where the Yatra will pass through, were won by Congress ally Samajwadi Party (SP) in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, when it fought in a tie-up with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and RLD. The SP has declared sitting MP Shafiqur Rahman Barq as its candidate for Sambhal, while it is yet to name its nominee for the Moradabad seat.
According to the original route, the Yatra was to traverse through Chandauli, Varanasi, Jaunpur, Allahabad, Bhadohi, Pratapgarh, Amethi, Raebareli, Lucknow, Hardoi, Sitapur (all in eastern and central UP) and Bareilly, Moradabad, Rampur, Sambal, Amroha, Aligarh, Badaun, Bulandshahr, and Agra (in western UP).

On February 12, the Congress announced that Rahul had decided to cut short his yatra by skipping the western region of UP. Later, the party said this was done to not inconvenience students, with the board exams starting from February 22.Advertisement
Congress spokesperson Anshu Awasthi had dismissed talk that the RLD’s hobnobbing with the BJP had led Rahul to curtail his Yatra in the region. “The Congress is not dependent on anyone. It is polite but not helpless,” he had said.
On Wednesday, its sixth day in UP, the Yatra entered Kanpur. It had entered the state from Bihar on February 16 and has since travelled across 11 districts.
Post its resumption on March 2, the Yatra will traverse through Morena, Gwalior, Shivpuri, Guna, Shajapur and Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh. Rahul will visit the Mahakaleshwar Temple in Ujjain, where he had paid obeisance in November 2022 during the Bharat Jodo Yatra.
Meanwhile, the BJP lashed out at Rahul on Wednesday for his “drunk youth of Uttar Pradesh” remarks. The Congress leader, in a veiled jibe at Modi, had said he had seen people in Varanasi lying on the road drunk.

“He (Rahul) said the youth of Uttar Pradesh are drunk. Is this the language he should use to talk about the region which was ruled by his family? And for so many years, he and his mother were MPs from?” former Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said.
In a retort to allegations that no one from the OBC or Tribal communities was at the consecration ceremony of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya on January 22 while wealthy people were in attendance, Prasad asked him to stop “insulting” Lord Ram and his devotees. “Rahul Gandhi, stop attacking the faith of the majority of Indian people and using arrogant language for youth,” he said.",politics
DMK’s offer to Kamal Haasan: A Lok Sabha seat or Rajya Sabha berth,"With the Lok Sabha elections round the corner, the DMK is looking to expand its alliance and has reportedly offered actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) the option of either contesting one Lok Sabha seat or accepting a post-poll Rajya Sabha berth, in exchange of extensive campaigning across the state for the alliance.
Sources in both parties said the talks are in the final stages. Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Haasan said talks with the DMK were ongoing and “good news” would be revealed soon.
The DMK-led ruling alliance in Tamil Nadu comprises the Congress, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) and the Left parties, and the move to include the MNM follows speculation from before the 2021 Assembly polls of Haasan’s inclination towards the alliance.Advertisement

A senior DMK leader said they would suggest Haasan to contest on the party’s symbol – the rising sun – as that would ease his way, and that the seat he might be offered is Coimbatore, where the MNM did well in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. “If he doesn’t want to contest, he will be given the option of being our star campaigner and can be given a Rajya Sabha berth later,” the leader said.
Sources said Haasan, who has been interested in politics for a long time and floated the MNM in 2018 as an alternative to the DMK and AIADMK, was more keen on contesting on the MNM symbol of torchlight, which was recently approved by the Election Commission (EC). An MNM insider said while it was up to Haasan to take the final call on the DMK’s offer, if he contested, it would be on the MNM symbol. “Joining hands with the DMK in this election is for a larger cause, and contesting on our symbol is a necessity,” the leader said.

Haasan is banking on his party’s impressive performance in Coimbatore (getting 1.44 lakh votes) and South Chennai (1.35 lakh votes) seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections to help him in the talks with DMK. In the 2021 Assembly polls though, the MNM vote share had dipped.
After the elections, Haasan saw several top leaders leave. He first developed ties to the Congress, but could not find a place in the DMK-led alliance in 2021. During the Bharat Jodo Yatra of Rahul Gandhi in 2022, he had participated for a stretch. Now, with the Congress fortunes not showing much revival, he sees the DMK as the best bet to revive its fortunes.",politics
"Alliance with Akhilesh up in air, Chandrashekhar Aazad gets set for solo UP run, says Opp ‘not ready to jolt BJP’","With the Jayant Chaudhary-led RLD breaking its alliance with the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party (SP) ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, Azad Samaj Party (ASP) led by Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Aazad is also preparing to go solo in Uttar Pradesh in the upcoming polls. 
Chandrashekhar, 37, has significant influence over Dalits in western UP. With the BSP staying away from the Opposition INDIA bloc, there were talks of an SP-RLD-ASP alliance taking shape to take on the BJP in the crucial western UP belt in the Lok Sabha polls.
“As of now, we are planning to contest 14 seats in UP on our own. We have not heard anything from SP on alliance yet and so we are preparing to go solo in the regions we are organisationally strong. People are ready to give a jolt to the BJP, but it appears the Opposition is not,” Chandrashekhar told The Indian Express.Advertisement
The development assumes significance in the backdrop of a disintegrating INDIA alliance. In December 2022, the SP, RLD and ASP had contested the Khatauli and Rampur Assembly bypolls in UP together. Their alliance was able to wrest Khatauli from the BJP, with the sizeable Dalit votes in the constituency consolidating in favour of the winning RLD candidate, which was attributed to the ASP factor.
The RLD has now dumped the INDIA camp to cross over to the BJP-led NDA. The relations between the SP and its major INDIA ally Congress remains strained with their seat-sharing negotiations running into troubles.
The alliance talks between the SP and the ASP have not really taken off, sources said. They said the SP is reluctant to commit to the ASP’s desire to contest the Nagina Lok Sabha constituency in western UP. Chandrashekhar himself intends to contest from this constituency and has even launched his door-to-door campaign there.
Nagina, which has significant Dalit and Muslim populations, is not a bastion of any party. In the 2009 Lok Sabha polls, the seat was won by the SP, in 2014 by the BJP and in 2019 by the BSP. In 1989, BSP supremo Mayawati had herself contested and won from the adjoining Bijnor constituency, part of which now falls in Nagina following the 2008 delimitation.Advertisement
The SP had contested the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in alliance with the BSP in UP (80 seats) in order to consolidate Yadav, Muslim and Dalit votes. However, the results did not benefit the SP much as it finished with just five seats. The BSP on the other hand bagged 10 seats which indicated that while the SP votes got transferred to the BSP, the latter’s votes shied away from the SP.
“We have influence in many regions of the state, but we were not finalising our candidates for these seats as we were speculating we would have to contest far fewer seats following the alliance. But now the polls are just a month and half away and we are now going about our poll plans,” an ASP leader said.
The 14 seats in UP where the ASP is making poll preparations include Siddharth Nagar, Lucknow, Amroha, Meerut, Saharanpur, Nagina, Muzzaffarnagar, Lalganj, Azamgrah, Ambedkar Nagar and Ayodhya. The party has conducted an assessment of its booth committees and is likely to announce a list of candidates following a meeting of its leaders and workers in the first week of March, sources said.
Apart from UP, Chandrashekhar’s party is also considering fielding candidates in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar, Delhi, Jharkhand and Haryana in the Lok Sabha polls. “Wherever we have our organisation and garnered significant votes in Assembly polls, we are contesting in such states. We have to work harder since we are a new party with limited resources. We do not get money through electoral bonds or from corporates. We are funded by our workers,” Chandrashekhar said.Advertisement
In Haryana, the ASP is likely to contest Ambala, Sirsa and Faridabad; in Rajasthan, Alwar and Bharatpur; in Madhya Pradesh, Gwalior and Morena; in Bihar, Hajipur and Sasaram; in Jharkhand, Palamu and Jamshedpur; and in Delhi, outer Delhi and south Delhi.",politics
Decode Politics | Akhilesh Yadav’s ‘PDA’ pitch: Why making new friends not as easy as public display of affection,"For the coming Lok Sabha polls, even as it has tied up with the INDIA bloc, the Samajwadi Party (SP) has come up with a ‘PDA’ formulation to consolidate and expand its vote bank in Uttar Pradesh. However, in a blow to this, several senior leaders have recently lashed out at the SP leadership, accusing it of doing exactly the opposite of what it professes and neglecting the ‘PDA’ communities. On Tuesday, prominent OBC leader Swami Prasad Maurya quit the SP.
As the SP figures out its party candidates and voter outreach initiatives while keeping the ‘PDA’ in mind — and at the same time tries to balance ally demands – this is why the SP has a task on its hands:
What is the PDA grouping?  
In June 2017, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav floated the acronym, standing in for ‘Picchde (backward classes), Dalits and Alpsankhyak (minorities)’ communities. When some upper caste leaders in the SP expressed the apprehension that this could send an exclusionary message to the upper castes and tribal communities, Akhilesh expanded the PDA definition ahead of the Assembly polls in October 2022. The ‘A’ in ‘PDA’, he said, also included “agde (forward)”, “Adivasi (Scheduled Tribes)” and “aadhi aabadi (women)”, cutting across all communities.Advertisement
In Uttar Pradesh, as per the Hukum Singh committee set up in 2001 under then Chief Minister Rajnath Singh, Other Backward Classes (OBCs) account for 43.1% of the state population. Among the minority communities in the state are Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains, with Muslims making up the largest bloc, at 19% of the total population according to the 2011 Census. It placed the Dalit population at 23%.

Hence, on paper, the three groups under the ‘PDA’ which the SP is targeting comprise an estimated 85% of the state population, leading Akhilesh to boast that the ‘PDA’ will defeat the BJP-led NDA in the coming Lok Sabha polls. But while Muslims and Yadavs are an SP vote bank, it has struggled to attract non-Yadav OBCs while Dalits have traditionally voted for the BSP and now for the BJP.
How is SP going about PDA consolidation?
To promote its PDA pitch, the party is affixing the acronym to all its voter outreach campaigns. For example, the party’s Samajwadi Lohia Vahini wing organised a 6,000-km “PDA Yatra” covering 29 UP districts from August 9 to November 22 (party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav’s birth anniversary) last year. “We reached out to people coming under PDA and told them about the false promises that the BJP had made and the vision that the SP has for their empowerment,” Abhishek Yadav, national president of the Samajwadi Lohia Vahini, said. During the yatra, the party also advocated for a caste census.
Besides, the SP has organised PDA-linked pakhwaras, chaupals and jan panchayats, with similar objectives. Such programmes have generally involved the party’s minority, Scheduled Caste (SC) and OBC wings, with senior leaders including MPs addressing the events.
Why is SP facing internal backlash over PDA?Advertisement
Swami Prasad Maurya resigned as SP national general secretary before announcing that he was quitting the party on Tuesday. The prominent OBC leader who was once a confidant of BSP chief Mayawati accused the SP of “discrimination”, and Akhilesh of “ignoring” the PDA communities. Maurya has been making controversial comments against the Ramcharitmanas; and the SP, wary of the backlash amidst the Ram Temple euphoria, has distanced itself from them.
Maurya’s exit followed days after former five-time SP MP Saleem Shervani resigned as a national general secretary, alleging Akhilesh was neglecting PDA communities. In his resignation letter, Shervani asked how the SP was different from the BJP in this. Shervani cited the absence of a Muslim in the SP’s Rajya Sabha list as an example.

SP ally Apna Dal (Kamervadi), whose core vote base are the Kurmis (an OBC group), has also raised issues regarding the SP list. Its chief and Sirathu MLA Pallavi Patel said she would abstain from voting in the Rajya Sabha elections, asking why the party had not picked members from the PDA groups. The three SP candidates are Ramji Lal Suman, a Dalit, apart from actor-politician Jaya Bachchan and former UP chief secretary Alok Ranjan, both upper caste Kayastha leaders.
Patel, who won in the 2022 Assembly polls on an SP ticket, also hinted that her party would not continue its alliance with the SP. However, later, Patel and other Apna Dal (K) leaders participated in the Congress’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra led by Rahul Gandhi in Varanasi.Advertisement
How does PDA figure in names announced by SP for Lok Sabha so far?
The first list of 16 candidates released on January 30 included 11 OBCs –  four of them Kurmis – along with one Muslim and one Dalit. Its second list of 11 candidates, released on Monday, had five Dalits, four OBCs, one Muslim and one Rajput. It released a third list on Tuesday, with five names.
The SP has also made changes to ensure a PDA-friendly state executive committee for UP. Announced last August, the committee includes just four Yadavs but 27 non-Yadav OBC leaders, in addition to 12 Muslims, and one Sikh and Christian each. While Muslims account for 17% of the team, SCs and STs together are 14%.
Has SP tried this before?  
The SP has come to power in past state polls when it has rallied the support of non-Yadav OBCs and Muslims. In the 2022 Assembly polls, for example, the party forged an umbrella alliance of six smaller OBC-based parties, and won 111 seats on its own, at a time when the BSP and Congress were reduced to 1 and 2. Later, however, two parties from that alliance – Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) – quit, and are now in the BJP camp.Advertisement
This makes it extremely crucial that the SP expands its support base on its own. Party sources said that even if it does not pay off in the Lok Sabha elections, Akhilesh hopes to meet his goal by the time of the 2027 Assembly polls.",politics
"Mayawati cuts ties with Gondwana party after MP, Chhattisgarh fiasco, to go solo in LS polls","Months after its bid to ally with the Gondwana Gantantra Party (GGP) for the November 2023 Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh came a cropper, the Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has broken up with the GGP, deciding to go solo in both the states in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.
Recently, the BSP also snapped its alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in Punjab.
The BSP leaders justified the party’s move to cut its ties with the GGP, saying their alliance did not work and that the GGP failed to transfer its tribal votes to the BSP candidates in the two states.Advertisement
The GGP has rejected these claims. It was founded in 1991 to represent the Gond people and champion the demand for a separate Gondwana state.
The BSP had tied up with the GGP in MP and Chhattisgarh to undertake a “new social engineering”, looking to bring about an “alignment of Dalit and tribal voters” ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.
The BSP had hoped if its “alliance experiment” with the GGP worked in the two state polls, it would benefit the party in the tribal-inhabited districts of Uttar Pradesh, too, both in the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls.
“But the BSP made no gain from this alliance in the Assembly polls. The BSP could not win any seat in both the states and the party’s vote share too came down,” said Ramakant Pippal, the MP BSP president. “The GGP could not transfer its votes to BSP candidates. Also, the GGP did not follow the gathbandhan spirit and fielded a candidate in the Jabera seat where the BSP was contesting. But the BSP voters supported the GGP candidates. So the BSP has decided to not continue with the alliance and contest all Lok Sabha seats alone.”Advertisement
As per the seat-sharing arrangement for the elections to the 230-member MP Assembly, the BSP contested 178 seats while the GGP fielded candidates in 52 constituencies. Not only did the BSP fail to win any seat, but its vote share also fell to 3.4% from 5% in the 2018 polls, when it had won two seats in the state. The GGP did not win any seats either in 2023 or 2018, with its vote share dropping from 1.8% to 0.9%.
In Chhattisgarh, the BSP contested 53 seats and won none with a vote share of 2%, down from 3.9% in 2018, when it had won two seats while contesting without an alliance. The GGP contested 37 constituencies and won one seat, though its vote share dipped to 1.4% from 1.7% in 2018, when it had allied with the Samajwadi Party (SP) but failed to win any seat.
The GGP’s Chhattisgarh working president Kuldeep Prajapati said the parties fell short of their target in the 2023 polls. “Both the GGP and BSP could not achieve the gain that the two parties had expected with the alliance in the Assembly polls. We had hoped to collectively win up to six seats in Chhattisgarh and become part of the government as a balancing power. And, the BSP was then more eager for alliance. But no party initiated talks for an alliance in the Lok Sabha polls. The GGP, in its national executive meet held in Bilaspur on February 11, decided to contest Lok Sabha elections without alliance both in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh,” Prajapati said.
Prajapati also rejected the BSP’s claim that the GGP could not transfer votes to its candidates. “The GGP vote base was transferred to the BSP. The GGP too got a few BSP votes. But it takes two to four years to bring voters of two different communities together on the ground. If the alliance had been announced a few months earlier, we would have got better results,” he said.Advertisement
The BSP central coordinator and Rajya Sabha MP, Ramji Gautam, said the party will now contest the Lok Sabha polls in Chhattisgarh, MP and Punjab on its own steam.
Dalits and tribals together make up a considerable share of the population in MP and Chattisgarh – while Dalits number at 17% and 15%, respectively, the tribal community accounts for 22% and 32%, respectively. However, in both the states, these groups have largely supported the Congress and the BJP in elections.",politics
"Today in Politics: Will they or won’t they? AAP, Congress’s Delhi dance continues","The Chandigarh Mayor’s post may be with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for now but even better news for the INDIA alliance of Opposition parties on Tuesday was when the Delhi Chief Minister said that seat-sharing talks with the Congress for Delhi were in the final stages and a decision would be made “very soon”.
Kejriwal’s statement came exactly a week after the AAP in a public snub to the Congress said the party did not deserve a single seat in Delhi based on merit and statistics but was being offered one “keeping in mind the alliance dharma”. AAP national general secretary Sandeep Pathak had blamed a considerable delay in finalising seat-sharing for his party’s unilateral move.
What the contours of a possible Delhi deal looks like is not yet clear and it has to be seen if the Congress or the AAP provide more clarity on Wednesday. The uphill battle that awaits any Opposition alliance in the national Capital cannot be understated — the BJP swept Delhi the last two times, winning all seven seats.Advertisement
But one thing that Kejriwal reiterated on Tuesday is that there will be no pre-poll agreement in Punjab, another state where the two parties are direct rivals and a lot of animosity exists between their state leaders. “Do not worry, that (contesting independently) is a strategy for victory,” Kejriwal told reporters without elucidating further. Does it mean that the two parties will have some sort of a tacit understanding to ensure they do not eat into each other’s votes in the state?
In context: With a couple of months to go for the Lok Sabha polls, the INDIA alliance has not been able to firm up either a seat-sharing agreement or a visible and coherent strategy on the ground. While there are signals here and there — like Kejriwal’s statement and Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi Yadav coming together for a rally in Bihar — the big picture is that the alliance’s constituents are acting on their own on the ground and there is no agreement on how they will contest the elections together, if at all they do. While Congress MP Rahul Gandhi continues with his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Uttar Pradesh, Tejashwi, the leader of the RJD, has embarked on his own statewide yatra in Bihar.
Meanwhile, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance in Maharashtra is struggling to strike a seat-sharing pact because of disagreements over eight constituencies, as Alok Deshpande reported on Monday. There is no clarity either in UP, which is the most important of the big battlegrounds. The Samajwadi Party (SP) on Tuesday announced five more names for the Lok Sabha polls, taking the total number of candidates it has fielded to 32. This came a day after the party said it had offered 17 seats to the Congress, six more than its initial offer last month, and that Akhilesh Yadav would join Rahul in his yatra only after a breakthrough in talks. It is telling that it has been five days since the yatra has been in UP and there is no sign yet of the two heavyweights coming together on stage.
Farmers’ march and BJP’s dilemma
Days after talks with the government collapsed, farmers who have massed along the Punjab-Haryana border are scheduled to begin their march to Delhi at 11 am to press their demands, the biggest of which is a legal guarantee of Minimum Support Price (MSP) for all crops. But they are unlikely to make much headway given the heavy security build-up on the border.Advertisement
For the BJP, the march presents a conundrum given that Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year spoke of farmers as one of the four “biggest castes” that the government would have to uplift if the country had to develop. But now with a section of farmers clearly unhappy, the optics, at the very least, look bad for the ruling party in the run-up to the parliamentary polls.
It has also got repercussions for the party in Punjab, one state in the north where it has not been able to expand. After initially maintaining silence, state BJP president Sunil Jakhar over the weekend cautioned the protesting farmers against being used as a political pawn by “so-called mediators”. It was a dig at Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann who has been trying to mediate between the Centre and the farm unions. Meanwhile, former Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh who during his tenure had allowed the farmers to proceed to Delhi during the 2020-’21 protests told Kanchan Vasdev in an interview that the Centre was “sympathetic towards the farmers” but the protesters would have to understand that the resolution would have to be “within the national perspective”.

"Decode Politics: Jobs to ‘BAAP’, why Tejashwi Yadav is first off the blocks in LS poll race","Bihar Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Yadav on Tuesday embarked on a 10-day statewide Jan Vishwas Yatra during which he and his Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) will cover 33 of all 38 districts of the state. The yatra, which will conclude on March 1, marks an early start for Tejashwi’s Lok Sabha election campaign and provides him with the chance to establish the RJD’s poll narrative.
As Tejashwi set off on the yatra from Muzaffarpur, he not only targeted Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, he also coined a term, “BAAP”, to explain the reach of his party’s social combination. Taking aim at Nitish before leaving for Muzaffarpur, the former Deputy CM told reporters in Patna, “Nitish Kumar has no vision for the people of the state. He also had no justifiable reason for ditching us and going back to the BJP-led NDA. He thinks he can trample the people’s mandate under his feet (janaadesh ko apne pair ki jooti samajhte hain).”
In Muzaffarpur, Tejashwi said, “Nitish Kumar has no new vision for Bihar. He is a man of old thoughts. He did not have any reason to switch alliances.”Advertisement
Why is Tejashwi going on a yatra?
The RJD leader wants to consolidate his image as the next big political leader in Bihar after Nitish Kumar and get a headstart on both the JD(U) and the BJP before the parliamentary polls. The Opposition party has been constantly talking about how during the 2020 Bihar Assembly election campaign it promised to generate 10 lakh jobs if voted to power, and while in government for 17 months, created almost 4 lakh jobs.
Targeting Nitish, the RJD has shared old video statements of the CM saying it was impossible to give 10 lakh jobs and that it was “Mungerilal ka sapna (wishful thinking)”. An RJD strategist said, “At the outset, we are sharing with people what we have done for Bihar and what is our vision for youth.”
What will Tejashwi do over the next 10 days?
The former Bihar Deputy CM will travel to towns and address mostly youngsters, drilling home the message about the RJD’s emphasis on job creation and vision for the youth. To ensure the focus is solely on Tejashwi, no big leader will accompany him or address the crowd. The yatra is being organised by the RJD’s district leadership teams and MLAs, who are in charge of the logistics and for mobilising crowds.

The RJD leader is looking to address three to four meetings each day for about 20 minutes each, keeping his speech focused on the achievements of the Bihar government of which the RJD was part, and target both Nitish Kumar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Advertisement
What is the main message of the yatra?
At all three meetings on the opening day, Tejashwi elaborated how the Mahagathbandhan government — in which RJD held the key departments of education, health, road construction, and rural works — gave government jobs to 3.75 lakh people and another 24,000 jobs had been approved before Nitish ditched the Opposition alliance and moved back to the BJP-led NDA
“Humne aane wali kisi sarkar ke liye lakir badi kar di hai. Ab koi bhi aayega usko batana hoga ki usne kitni naukriyan di (We have set a big target for whoever is in power. They have to tell the people how many jobs they have generated,” the RJD leader said, adding that it was about taking credit and not just sharing it.
“After all, why should not I take credit for what we have done as ministers? Nitish Kumar did head the government but his was the number three party. We are the single-largest party in the current Vidhan Sabha,” he said.

Ever since reports emerged in January of Nitish considering jumping ship again, the RJD has aggressively stuck to pointing out its track record in creating jobs and governance in the 17 months that it was in power. This is an attempt to shift the perception of the RJD being just an M-Y party and is part of a well-calibrated strategy. The RJD wants to send out the message that economic justice is at the centre of its agenda as much as social justice.Advertisement
What is ‘BAAP’?
Tejashwi, whose speech in the Bihar Assembly during the trust vote last week received a lot of attention for the way he tore into Nitish without expressing any rancour, explained that the RJD was more than a party of Muslims and Yadavs even in terms of social combinations. “People say RJD is M-Y party. But let me tell you we have BAAP along with M-Y. BAAP stands for ‘Bahujan, Agda (forward castes), Aadhi Aabadi (women), and Poor. We are an A-Z party,” he said.
The RJD has become a major political force in Bihar on the back of the support it enjoys among Muslims and Yadav OBCs who comprise more than 31% of the state’s population. But since its success in the 2020 Bihar Assembly polls, the RJD has been trying to expand its base.",politics
Third time lucky? Why this Act on Maratha quota is unlike two previous bidsPremium Story,"NOW THAT the Maharashtra Assembly has unanimously passed a Bill to set aside 10% reservation for the Marathas under socially and educationally backward categories in jobs and education, the question on everyone’s minds is, will it clear judicial scrutiny.
The Bill was formulated based on a report of the Justice (retired) Sunil B Shukre-led Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission (MSBCC). However, at least two previous legislation extending quota to Marathas have failed legal challenge, which was the point on which the Opposition tried to pin the Eknath Shinde-led government on Tuesday.
One common thread running through the three bids has been that all came in the run-up to elections.Advertisement
* Narayan Rane committee
In a first bid for a special law for Marathas, the then Prithviraj Chavan-led Congress government brought in an ordinance giving 16% reservation in government jobs and education to the community, ahead of the 2014 elections. It was based on the recommendations of a Narayan Rane-led committee, which was not a statutory backward class commission.
The ordinance was challenged before the Bombay High Court, and it stayed the move in its interim order of November 2014. In the same year, the Supreme Court refused to vacate the stay.

In 2015, the BJP-Shiv Sena government led by Devendra Fadnavis turned the ordinance into an Act, which was passed in the Assembly. However, a year later, the Bombay High Court stayed the Act for its resemblance to the ordinance.
In 2017, the Fadnavis government set up the Maharashtra State Backward Class commission under Justice (retd) M G Gaikwad of the Bombay High Court.Advertisement
* Gaikwad Commission
The Gaikwad panel gave its report in November 2018, after a survey of 43,629 families, with at least two villages picked from each of the 355 talukas in the state where Marathas made up more than 50% of the population.
The report said that 76.86% of the Maratha families were engaged in agriculture and agriculture labour (combined), 6% were in government and semi-government services, 3% in private services, 4% in trade and industry, and 9% in non-agricultural physical labour.
It also found that 13.42% of the Marathas were illiterate, 35.31% only had primary education, 43.79% had finished high school, and that the numbers dropped to just 6.71% for those who had finished graduation or post-graduation, while only 0.77% were technically and professionally qualified.

On the basis of this, then CM Fadnavis brought in Maharashtra’s Socially and Educationally Backward Class (SEBC) Act, 2018, providing the Marathas 16% quota overall in education and government jobs.Advertisement
The legislation was first challenged in the Bombay High Court, which ruled that the quota granted under the Act was not “justifiable”, and reduced it to 12% in education and 13% in government jobs.
The matter went to the Supreme Court, and in May 2021, a Constitution Bench struck down the quota altogether, noting that the Maharashtra government had failed to prove any exceptional circumstances or provide sufficient empirical data regarding the Marathas to justify exceeding the 50% quota ceiling.
The Court also referred to the findings of the Gaikwad Commission that over 30% Marathas were in public service, and said the Gaikwad panel and High Court had failed to take into account that “Marathas are the dominant forward class and are in mainstream national life”.
The Court said the Gaikwad commission ought to have focused on what had happened since 2008 that the Marathas had become a backward class – the National and State Backward Class Commissions prior to 2008 had rejected the Maratha community’s claim to it.Advertisement
At the same time, the Court “left it open to the State to collect relevant data to find out whether a particular case or community is to be included in the backward class”.

It was based on this that the Justice Shukre panel was formed, with the Shinde government’s brief for it being to go in for a large-scale survey, to ensure there was sufficient empirical data to justify Maratha reservation.
* The Shukre Commission
The committee to determine the status of the Marathas was set up in December 2023 with Justice (retd) Sunil B Shukre of the Bombay High Court as chairperson. Over the past two months, the Commission claims to have surveyed 1,58,20,264 families across the state.
The Shukre commission notes that the population of Marathas in the state is 28%, while 84 % of them are not advanced, adding that such a large backward community cannot be added into the OBC bracket.Advertisement
The Commission describes extreme poverty, decline in agricultural income, and partitions in land holdings as reasons for the current status of the Marathas. It also notes that 94% of farmers who have died by suicide in the state belonged to the Maratha community.
The panel finds inadequate representation of the community in all sectors of public services, and says the Marathas have remained “completely out of the mainstream” due to their backwardness.
It calls for separate reservation to the Marathas to increase their representation in government jobs and developed sectors.
The Opposition has targeted the Shinde-led Sena-BJP-Ajit Pawar NCP government saying the new law is likely to be challenged in court too. Rohit Pawar, an MLA belonging to Sharad-Pawar led NCP, said there were many errors in the draft of the Bill and that it was not clear about the basis of the decision “to give 10 percent reservation while showing 28% population for Marathas”, he posted on X.Advertisement
“The government’s attempt to bring a Bill in haste in the run-up to the elections should not mislead the common man,” Rohit added.",politics
"SP continues its blows on Congress, names candidates for 2 seats left for ally","A day after claiming to have offered 17 Lok Sabha seats to the Congress in Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Party (SP) on Tuesday declared its candidate for the Varanasi constituency and appointed two leaders as in-charge for Amroha. Both Varanasi and Amroha featured in the list of 17 seats offered to the Congress.
In the high-profile Varanasi constituency from where Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been elected twice, the SP has fielded former minister Surendra Singh Patel, an OBC leader.
The party has appointed Mehboob Ali and Ram Avatar Saini as in-charge of Amroha, indicating that either Ali or Saini will contest from the west UP seat if the Congress decides not to fight from there. In the last Lok Sabha elections, Amroha was won by Danish Ali from the BSP. Following his suspension from the BSP, Ali has come close to the Congress and attended the launch of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, led by Rahul Gandhi, in Manipur.Advertisement
In the list of candidates declared on Tuesday, SP president Akhilesh Yadav has replaced his cousin brother Dharmendra Yadav with uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav in Badaun.
In the first list of candidates released on January 30, the SP had announced Dharmendra’s candidature from Badaun. On Tuesday, the SP appointed him as in-charge of both Kannauj and Azamgarh, dropping hints that he may contest the Lok Sabha election from either of the two seats that are considered SP strongholds. Dharmendra had, however, faced defeat in Azamgarh bypoll in 2022.
The other four new candidates declared on Tuesday include Ikra Hasan from Kairana, Praveen Singh Aron from Bareilly, Ajendra Singh Rajput from Hamirpur, and Surendra Singh Patel from Varanasi. Ikra is the sister of SP MLA from Kairana Nahid Hasan and daughter of former MP Tabassum Begum. Former MP Aron had lost the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Bareilly on Congress symbol.
So far, the SP has declared candidates for 31 Lok Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh.Advertisement
Sources in the SP that the 17 seats offered to the Congress include Raebareli, Amethi, Kanpur, Bansgaon, Fatehpur Sikri, Prayagraj, Saharanpur, Maharajganj, Amroha, Varanasi, Bulandshahr, Jhansi, Ghaziabad, Mathura, Deoria, Barabanki and Deoria.
“Till date, the Congress has not given any response to the list of 17 seats offered to it by the SP. So, the SP is keeping itself prepared to contest those seats,” SP spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhry said.

Sources in the SP said that the delay in finalising the seat-sharing agreement with the Congress was because the latter was asking for three more seats, including Rampur and Moradabad where the SP had won in 2019. The third seat being sought by the Congress is Ballia.
“The SP had won both Moradabad and Rampur in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, and therefore there is no point in leaving these seats to the Congress. The SP had lost Ballia then but with a very small margin of 15,519 votes. So, we are not going to leave Ballia to the Congress,” said an SP leader.Advertisement
SP chief Akhilesh Yadav on Monday said that he would join Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra only after the seat-sharing is finalised between the two parties.
“We are in the process (of finalising). Our alliance team is there, and the Congress president has appointed a team of leaders for alliance. The discussion is going on. It will be finalised any time. Wait for some time,” Congress general secretary K C Venugopal said. “We are hopeful of a solution,” the senior Congress leader added.",politics
"Why Maratha panel said quota ‘need of hour’, warned of ‘social imbalance’","The Bill to grant 10% reservation to the Maratha community in education and employment passed by the Maharashtra Assembly on Tuesday was formulated based on the report of the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission, which says it took into consideration “widespread data of 1.58 crore households collected from the nook and corner of the state”, used resources such as scientific survey, books, writings, opinions, and accounted for suggestions and disagreements.
Apart from finding the Maratha community “socially, educationally and economically backward”, the report said it was inadequately represented in public employment and education with low financial resources. It also said that 94% of farmers in the state who had committed suicide were from the Maratha community.
What are the report’s findings?
It says that Marathas make up 28% of the state’s population and 84% of them fall under the non-creamy layer category, making them eligible for protection in terms of reservation in employment and education, as held by the Supreme Court in the Indra Sawhney case.Advertisement
“Maratha households falling below the poverty line and having yellow ration cards are 21.11% while open category households falling in the category stand at 18.09%. The percentage of Maratha households (in the category) is above the state average (of 17.4%) and this shows that they are economically backward,” the report stated.
The commission also concluded that the Marathas have suffered abject poverty for decades as their primary source of income was agriculture, which was depleting with each passing year.

Education indicators, the report said, clearly illustrate the community’s lower education levels, especially in completion of secondary education and achieving graduate, post-graduate and professional degrees.
“Economic backwardness is the highest barrier to education. Insufficient education often invites poverty and vice-versa. The Maratha community’s economic fortunes have since been marked by dwindling returns from agriculture, fragmentation of land holdings, loss of traditional dignity associated with agriculture, lack of attention to educational training of youths, etc,” the report states.Advertisement
What did the panel conclude on backwardness in employment?
The panel notes that the community is largely dependent on manual labour as porters or coolies, or employed in jobs of peon, sweepers, etc. It says that substantial sections of the community have also been left behind due to their inadequate representation in employment, services and in avenues of education.
Why did the panel seek a quota above the 50% limit?
The panel says it examined cases in various parts of the country where the 50% ceiling of quota, as set by the Supreme Court, has been exceeded. The commission draws references from the Bihar Reservation of Vacancies of Posts and Services (for SCs, STs and OBCs) (Amendment) Act, 2023, and the Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, SCs and STs (Reservation of Seats in Educational Institutions and of appointments of Posts in the Services under the State) Act, 1993. In Bihar the amendment took the percentage of reservations to 65% while in Tamil Nadu it stands at 69%.
The panel notes that the ceiling set by the Supreme Court can be exceeded if any peculiar, unique and distinctive circumstances and situations exist, and that such reservation would stand the test of reasonableness and/or intelligible differentia under Article 14 of the Constitution.
Why a quota separate from the existing one for OBCs?
As per the panel, the Maratha community is so deprived that it needs a distinct classification from the existing OBCs, and that this needs immediate attention and resolution. It says that compared to OBCs, the backwardness of Marathas is more pervasive in terms of coverage and penetration, and further regressive in character.Advertisement
The commission thus notes that the classification of Marathas as a separate category for reservation is not unreasonable and that any remedial measure of providing “reasonably adequate extent of reservation to such a class” would be in conformity with the obligation of the Constitution.
“The reservation for the vulnerable Maratha community is the need of the hour and necessary, not only for making available to it a platform which it can use for its social and educational advancement but also to prevent its future generations from slipping below the present level. If not done so on an urgent basis, the community would denigrate even further leading to complete societal imbalance,” the panel says.
Why was political reservation not suggested?
The commission says there is no need for the community to be granted political reservation as it is adequately represented with numerical strength in the state.",politics
Capt Amarinder Singh: ‘PM Modi wants farm stir resolution soon… Farmers must understand this has to be within national perspective’,"Senior Punjab BJP leader and ex-chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi Monday and discussed various matters, including the current farmers’ agitation, the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, and the question of the BJP’s realliance with former ally Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). In an interview with The Indian Express, Amarinder spoke on a range of these issues. Excerpts:
How was your discussion with PM Modi?
I went to meet the Prime Minister as we had not met for a long time. He and I were the chief ministers of Gujarat and Punjab (respectively) at the same time (2002-2007). Later, when I became the chief minister for the second time (in 2017), he was the Prime Minister. Also, there is this burning issue of farmers’ agitation. I wanted to discuss that with him. It was a good meeting, where we discussed a number of issues.
What did PM Modi say on the farmers’ protest?
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Centre is trying to find a solution to the farmers’ agitation. The Prime Minister is very sympathetic to the farmers’ issues. He wants a resolution to the issue (farm stir) soon.Advertisement
I gave my views to the PM on the issue. I can say that everyone in the Union government is sympathetic towards the farmers. But the farmers must also understand that this has to be within the national perspective. If you want MSP for all crops and all farmers, you must also realise that half of India is growing wheat and rice. Then they will get MSP for wheat and rice. It will not benefit Punjab farmers as a whole. They must consider this.

As the Punjab CM, you allowed the farmers to move to Delhi during their 2020 stir. Should they be allowed to do the same this time?
When I was the CM, I dealt with the issue. I allowed them (farmers) to move to Delhi. But then there was violence. The Red Fort episode took place. The farmers should now stay put where they are and their representatives can go and meet the Union government’s representatives, like they have been doing and holding meetings with them. Solutions emerge after dialogue. I feel the agitating farmers sitting at Haryana border are responsible farmers. They have not indulged in any violence. I hope it is resolved soon. There is no point in carrying on and sitting on roads. They also realise that the situation is not good. People are harassed and angry.

Will you contest Lok Sabha elections?
No. I will not contest the elections. Preneet Kaur (suspended Congress MP from Patiala) will contest from Patiala. My daughter Jai Inder Kaur will contest from my seat during Assembly elections. (Amarinder is former MLA from Patiala-Urban). Preneet works hard. She has been a four-time MP from Patiala. She contested five times. Jaya (Jai Inder) is also working hard. She is the president of the state BJP Mahila wing and has been working in all the districts. It is time for younger generation to come forward. I am there for the party. I will help the party. I have been active for 57 years in politics. Now, it is time to pass on the baton to the younger generation.
Did you discuss BJP-SAD alliance with the PM?
I am all for the alliance of the BJP with Akalis. There should be a headway. We should fight together in Lok Sabha polls to counter our opponents strongly.",politics
"Chandigarh Mayor: AAP-Congress gets post, but BJP numbers to keep chair rocky","While the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Congress won a moral and legal victory Tuesday, wresting the post of Chandigarh Municipal Corporation Mayor, they face a long road ahead.
By the time the Supreme Court held the January 30 election that instated a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Mayor as invalid, the BJP had managed to win three AAP councillors to its side. This means that in the general house of the civic body, the BJP now has 17 councillors, the same as the AAP-Congress combine (whose numbers are down from 20 to 17). The BJP can additionally count on its Chandigarh MP Kirron Kher, the ex-officio member of the corporation, and the sole Akali Dal councillor.

One of the immediate challenges before new Mayor Kuldeep Kumar Tita will be surviving a non-confidence motion in the House, with numbers skewed against him.Advertisement
There is also a question mark on the legality of the election of BJP councillors Kuljeet Sandhu and Rajinder Sharma as Senior Deputy Mayor and Deputy Mayor, respectively, given that they were picked unopposed after the AAP and Congress boycotted the polls over the disputed Mayor election.
But even if elections are held again for the two posts – which seems likely – the BJP is well-placed to win them.
As per legal experts, to win a no-confidence motion, Kuldeep Kumar must get a majority of the votes of the councillors in the house, plus two-third of those present and voting.

A senior BJP leader said the party was confident of voting out Kuldeep Kumar as the Congress-AAP alliance remains fragile and is set to come apart under seat-sharing pressures of the Lok Sabha elections.Advertisement
“The BJP already has a simple majority in the house. If the alliance of the AAP and Congress falls apart, the Congress will definitely try to bring down the Mayor, and we will have the two-third numbers, even if all the 10 AAP councillors vote for Kuldeep. So there are several permutations and combinations,” the leader said.
The BJP is also counting on Kuldeep Kumar being hamstrung due to a code of conduct for the Lok Sabha polls kicking in soon, leaving little in his powers beyond holding house meetings.

“So he will be an ineffective Mayor, and by the time of the polls, the Congress-AAP alliance will also fall apart,” the BJP leader said.
As per a BJP councillor, even if this fissure does not happen now, the Congress and AAP bonhomie is bound to collapse after the Lok Sabha elections. “In case the Congress performs badly, they will never let this AAP Mayor continue,” the councillor said.Advertisement
Even without a no-confidence motion being brought in, Kuldeep Kumar will have a hard time controlling a house in which the BJP has a majority. There are also nine nominated councillors who are affiliated to the BJP mostly, who are not allowed to vote in the Mayor election but can voice their opinion in the house.
A BJP councillor said: “Kuldeep Kumar will have 26 voices speaking against his every decision… It will not be a walk in the park.”
The councillor added that the two allies may fall apart even as early as when elections are held for the senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor. “If the Congress, which was promised the two posts within their alliance, loses, things will begin to fall apart.”",politics
"From the Urdu Press: ‘Rahul must halt Yatra, launch Cong Jodo campaign’, ‘Cynical towards farmers, govt wants privatisation in agriculture’","As the agitating Punjab farm leaders rejected the Narendra Modi government’s offer and decided to resume their “Dilli Chalo” march on Wednesday to push for their various demands, the stage is set for a new round of showdown between the farmer protesters and the BJP dispensation on the eve of the Lok Sabha polls. The Opposition is looking to latch on to this row to boost the narrative of their poll campaign after having got a talking point on corruption in the wake of the Supreme Court’s judgment quashing the electoral bonds scheme. These stories dominated the Urdu dailies over the week, even as they tracked the continuing series of defections from the beleaguered Congress party.
URDU TIMES
Commenting on the state of affairs in the Congress, the Mumbai-based Urdu Times, in its editorial on February 18, says that at a time when Rahul Gandhi is engaged in leading his East-to-West Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra to create public awareness for the cause of justice, his party continues to lurch from crisis to crisis. “The Congress has been reeling from a wave of desertions, with one senior leader after another jumping ship to cross over to the BJP,” the editorial says. “So, Rahul Gandhi should first undertake a Congress Jodo campaign to fix the problems of his party. Otherwise, what will remain of his Yatra’s objective if his party unravels?”
The edit also says that it is high time the Congress did some soul-searching as to why its veteran leaders are bent on leaving. Senior Maharashtra Congress leaders, including ex-CM Ashok Chavan, Baba Siddique and Milind Deora, recently quit the party. Now there is buzz about Kamal Nath poised to follow suit. “These are extraordinary developments. The grand old party is getting fragmented, falling apart. It is imperative to restitch it to save its existence,” the daily writes. “The exit of such senior leaders is a pointer to a deep malaise, which needs to be understood and stemmed. Doubtless Rahul Gandhi is an enthusiastic Congress worker but he does not have the qualities of a successful leader, or else he would have halted his Yatra and reached out to his disgruntled party leaders to stop them from leaving the party.”Advertisement
The editorial states that Rahul should reflect on why he has not been able to convert big crowds that throng his Yatra rallies into votes for his party. “PM Modi or the BJP do not have a magic wand to attract these Congress leaders to their camp. The BJP weans them away when they find a rift,” it says. “So Rahul should leave the Yatra and launch a campaign to unite his own party so that it can survive the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. Other Congress leaders should also introspect on the reasons for such defections rather than resorting to just taking potshots at the BJP.”
ROZNAMA RASHTRIYA SAHARA
Referring to the Punjab farmer unions’ “Dilli Chalo” agitation, the multi-edition Roznama Rashtriya Sahara, in its February 15 leader headlined “Doosri kisan tehreek (farm stir 2.0)”, says this marks farmers’ second major agitation in three years, and the two are interlinked. “Following the farmers’ 2020-21 movement against three farm laws, the BJP-ruled Centre had repealed them… The government has enacted many laws, but it has not taken up the farmers’ demand for a legal guarantee on MSP for all their crops,” the editorial says, adding that MSP on all 23 crops as per the Swaminathan Commission report’s formula would be an “insurance” for farmers and would protect them from incurring a loss on their produce. The protesting farmers are also pressing for debt waiver, among other demands.
“But instead of fulfilling its pledges and accepting farmers’ demands, the government seems geared to block their peaceful march. It has used force against them on the Punjab-Haryana border,” the daily states. “The government does not appear to be ready to backtrack from its pro-capitalist policies. There is a disconnect between its words and its deeds. On the one hand, it has conferred the Bharat Ratna on Chaudhary Charan Singh and M S Swaminathan, and on the other, it is also clamping down on farmers protesting for their rights as per the principles of these farm icons.”
The edit says the Modi government has adopted a “cynical approach” towards the agriculture sector, where it would like to see privatisation as indicated by its three controversial laws. “The government was eventually forced to roll back these laws. This time too, farmers seem all set to continue their stir until the fulfilment of their demands,” it adds.
SIASATAdvertisement
Highlighting the Supreme Court’s judgment striking down the Modi government’s electoral bonds scheme of anonymous political funding, the Hyderabad-based Siasat, in its editorial on February 16, points out that the “historic verdict” held the scheme “violative” of the constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression and right to information. The unanimous verdict was given by a five-judge Constitution Bench headed by Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud.
The daily writes that while introducing the scheme from 2018, the government had claimed that it would curb black money in political funding while keeping the identity of donor companies or individuals anonymous. “These were the features of the scheme that led to public misgivings, with many suspecting that the corporates donating huge money to the political parties would also like to influence their functioning or policies to extract benefits,” it says.
The editorial notes that the apex court also ordered the SBI to submit the details of electoral bonds purchased since April 12, 2019, till date to the Election Commission, which was directed to publish all these information on its website by March 13. The top court has thus put an end to huge anonymous funding to the political players, even as the identity of such donors will also be revealed soon, the edit says. “This would also enable a closer scrutiny of various government policies in the context of the substantial funding of the ruling parties by certain corporate players.”
However, all political donations could not be dismissed as murky, the daily says. “In India, there has been a tradition of even common people giving donations to parties they support. But the track record of corporates on this score has not remained above board as several of them have had a quid pro quo deals with incumbent parties,” it says, adding that to keep such funding anonymous was not in public interest as they undermined the cause of probity. “This also flew in the face of the government and parties’ own pitch for maintaining transparency in public life.”",politics
"10 days after Jayant said joining NDA, what is BJP waiting for?","As the BJP remains mum on a formal confirmation of the alliance announced by Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Jayant Chaudhary 10 days ago, workers in both parties are getting anxious. Senior leaders, however, said the tie-up was all but sealed.
Speaking to reporters at the RLD’s central office in Delhi, after paying tributes to his father and party founder late Ajit Singh on his birth anniversary, Chaudhary had confirmed that his party will join the NDA ahead of the Lok Sabha elections – after dropping several hints that this was coming.
Since then, there has been no word on the seats the RLD will contest, or any photographs of senior BJP leaders receiving Jayant. While BJP leaders in western UP are silent, confessing that decisions are being taken by the central leadership on the matter, RLD members said the party was bargaining for four Lok Sabha seats – Baghpat, Bijnor, Kairana and Mathura – all in its base of west UP.Advertisement
Jayant, who last week visited Hapur district’s Noorpur, the birth place of his grandfather and former PM Chaudhary Charan Singh, fobbed off questions about the reason behind his exit from the INDIA bloc saying: “When a formal announcement is made, I will openly reply to questions like what were the reasons, our idea for the future, and what we want to do for our people and our area.”
Also read | As Jayant makes NDA switch official, a history of RLD’s U-turns: BJP to SP and now back to BJP
Insisting that the alliance is “finalised”, and just a formal announcement awaited, an RLD leader said: “Party leaders want Jayant to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Baghpat, the traditional seat of his family.”
One speculation is that the formal announcement might happen around the time of the unveiling of a life-size statue of Ajit Singh in Chhaprauli area of Baghpat Lok Sabha constituency. The initial date for the event was February 12. RLD sources said Prime Minister Narendra Modi may himself visit Chhaprauli now in the coming days to unveil the statue.
“The announcement of the RLD-BJP alliance is expected to be made before that. All the modalities have been decided,” a senior RLD leader said.Advertisement
However, as per other sources, the ongoing agitation by Punjab farmers and the BJP-led Haryana’s tough measures against them have queered the pitch. The leaders of the RLD, which claims to represent the interests of farmers apart from Jats, are facing questions over “Jayant’s silence” on the issue.
“Once farmers reach a settlement with the government, that will be a better atmosphere for the announcement of the BJP-RLD alliance. Right now, the BJP and RLD are both facing questions on the issue,” another RLD leader said.
In the 2020-21 farmer agitation against the three contentious farm laws, the RLD had been an active participant. Ajit Singh had given a call to bring farmers together and uproot the BJP government.
RLD national spokesperson Mohd Islam said it was wrong to say Jayant was “silent”. “The RLD is a farmers’ party, and we make no compromise on the issues of farmers. The RLD is speaking to the government and the NDA partners. Our priority is that the issues be resolved through dialogue between the government and farmers. And there should be no politics. Jayant is in touch with the government to find a solution,” Islam said.Advertisement
On the fear that the Muslim vote might desert the RLD, Islam said party workers were telling the community that the SP and other Opposition parties were raising the bogey about the BJP. “Opposition parties have made the Muslims negative. We are appealing to them to become positive,” Islam said.
Earlier, the RLD announcement that it was joining the NDA was a blow to the struggling INDIA bloc, which is now down one more ally.",politics
"PDP leader and ex-J&K Dy CM attends Modi rally, says have ‘come to listen to my PM’","SENIOR PDP leader and former Deputy Chief Minister Muzaffar Hussain Baig was present at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rally here Tuesday, setting off fresh speculation about leaders who might join the BJP in Jammu and Kashmir.
One of the founding members of the PDP, Baig is a prominent Pahari leader from Kashmir. Several prominent tribal leaders from other parties have joined the BJP in recent days but, if he does so, Baig will be the first Pahari leader from the Kashmir province to follow in their wake.
Baig neither confirmed nor denied whether he would be joining the BJP, asking instead: “Can’t one come to listen to one’s PM?” Describing his presence at the rally as “my duty”, he added: “It is not necessary to join, but will perform my duty as per their (PM’s) programme… Joining any party frustrates the larger goal of one nation.”Advertisement
All praise for PM Modi, the PDP leader said he has always had good relations with him, and that under his leadership, J&K had seen massive development; Kashmir had seen it “500 per cent”. “I have had good relations with PM Modi since I was in government (the Mufti Mohd Sayeed-led PDP-Congress government in J&K)… He (Modi) never asked me about my party, but always asked what our people needed.”
Baig also said that contrary to the belief that the Modi government will face a backlash in Kashmir in the coming Lok Sabha elections on account of the abrogation of Article 370, it will “perform well” in the province.

Associated with the PDP since its inception in the late 1990s, Baig had developed differences with the party over tickets for the District Development Council polls. In March 2021, he formally joined Sajad Lone’s Peoples Conference, only to be expelled a few months later. He “rejoined” the PDP only last month, claiming he had never left.
PDP leaders were not too happy over his return as Baig was seen to have taken a position contrary to the party’s over abrogation of Article 370, and was awarded the Padma Bhushan in January 2020, barely six months after the Centre took the decision.Advertisement
The award was accepted by Baig even when most of his party leadership including Mufti were behind bars and booked under the Public Safety Act.
Asked about Baig’s presence at the PM rally, a senior PDP functionary, who did not wish to be named, said Baig had never formally rejoined the party.
Recently, amid problems in INDIA seat-sharing talks for J&K, there was speculation that the National Conference was in discussions with the BJP. Though senior NC leader Omar Abdullah denied it, the rumours were fanned by former Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad claiming that the NC had long sought a truck with the BJP, a party it has had ties with before.
Baig’s move comes weeks after Parliament passed Bills extending ST status to Pahari-speaking ethnic groups and others, which was till then enjoyed only by the Gujjars and Bakerwals along with Shinas in J&K.Advertisement
There has been anger among the Gujjars and Bakerwals over this, but the party’s calculation is that this will be offset by the fact that post-Article 370, the benefits and protections enjoyed by STs elsewhere – including political reservation – are now available to them in J&K.
Recently, two prominent Pahari leaders Shehnaz Ganai and Mushtaq Bukhari joined the BJP, following in the footsteps of big names such as Abdul Qayoom Mir and Iqbal Malik.",politics
"Serial turncoat Afzal Ansari gets SP ticket now, set to contest after SC nod","Among the list of 11 candidates whose names the Samajwadi Party (SP) announced on Monday for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls, amid seat-sharing talks with the Congress, one name is bound to raise eyebrows — Afzal Ansari. Not only is the 70-year-old a sitting Bahujan Samajwadi Party (BSP) MP from Ghazipur, he was sentenced to four years in April 2023 in a Gangsters Act case, and is now out on bail, with his disqualification as an MP temporarily suspended by the Supreme Court.
Ansari, the brother of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, has been known to jump ship ahead of polls. The one constant through his terms as five-time MLA and two-time Lok Sabha MP has been Ghazipur district in eastern UP. All his Assembly terms have been from Mohammadabad, an Assembly segment under the Ballia Lok Sabha constituency of Ghazipur district. He progressed to the Lok Sabha from the Ghazipur constituency, and is seen to still enjoy widespread popularity.
Ansari was earlier a part of the CPI, moved to the SP in 1996, jumped to the BSP in 2009, and a year later, launched the Quami Ekta Dal (QED), which he merged with the BSP in 2019. He won the last Lok Sabha election on a BSP ticket, when the SP and BSP contested together. Monday’s announcement of Ansari as the SP nominee means his this stint with the BSP is also over.Advertisement
Political circles have been abuzz in Uttar Pradesh since January that SP chief Akhilesh Yadav could accommodate Afzal Ansari in the coming Lok Sabha polls on an SP ticket. Akhilesh had even attended Ansari’s daughter’s wedding in Lucknow accompanied by senior party leaders on January 4.
Speaking to The Indian Express around the time, Ansari had said that while suspending his conviction in December, the Supreme Court had allowed him to contest elections. The order said: “The Appellant shall not be disqualified to contest future election(s) during the pendency of his criminal appeal before the High Court and, if he is elected, such election will be subject to outcome of the First Criminal Appeal.”
The April 2023 conviction by a special court in Ghazipur was Ansari’s first, though the long list of cases against brother Mukhtar has always shadowed his four-decade-long political career.
“Because of his knowledge of law and politics, Afzal is the ‘brains’ in the family, planning all its moves, be it regarding poll campaigns or fighting legal battles,” a Ghazipur local told The Indian Express last year, pointing to Ansari’s rising victory margin every election. It is largely courtesy Ansari’s work that Mukhtar has won three Assembly elections despite being in jail since 2005.Advertisement
The biggest case against the Ansari brothers was the November 29, 2005, murder of Krishnanand Rai in Ghazipur along with six associates. Afzal and Mukhtar were prime accused in the case, and given their influence, its trial was transferred to Delhi by the Supreme Court. In 2019, a special CBI court in Delhi acquitted the Ansaris and five others, with an appeal pending in the Delhi High Court.
As per UP Police’s record, there are a total of seven criminal cases against Afzal. The first, of violation of Model Code of Conduct, was lodged in 1996, and the last in Chandauli in 2014 on the same charge.

"Prominent OBC face Swami Prasad Maurya now leaves SP, likely to float own party","About a week after resigning from his party post alleging “discrimination” and accusing Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav of ignoring the Pichda, Dalit and Alpasankhyak (PDA), Swami Prasad Maurya quit the party on Tuesday.
Sources said he could float his outfit in New Delhi on February 22, like he had done in 2016 after leaving the BSP.
A prominent non-Yadav OBC face of Uttar Pradesh politics, Maurya (70) had quit the Yogi Adityanath Cabinet ahead of the 2022 Assembly elections and joined the SP. He was known to take on the SP for around two decades, initially as a member of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and later the BJP.Advertisement

Once a close confidant of BSP chief Mayawati and a vocal face of the party, Maurya was not only made minister in every BSP government — in 1997, 2002 and 2007 — but was also Leader of Opposition every time the BSP was out of power. He was even made the BSP national general secretary, effectively making him No. 2 to Mayawati in the party hierarchy.
In 2016, while he was Leader of the Opposition, Maurya left the BSP, alleging “auctioning” of party tickets, an allegation refuted by Mayawati who, in turn, alleged that Maurya had quit because his son Utkrist and daughter Sanghmitra did not get tickets for the seats they had allegedly lobbied for.
He then formed his own party and named it the Loktantrik Bahujan Manch.Advertisement
Maurya later joined the BJP, just before the 2017 Assembly polls, claiming that he was impressed with the work done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the “weaker sections” of the society.

Maurya won his debut election in 1996 from Dalmau Assembly constituency of Rae Bareli district as a BSP candidate. Even in 2007, when Maurya lost the Assembly polls though the BSP came to power with a majority, Mayawati sent him to the Upper House of the state legislature and made him minister. Over the years, the five-time MLA has established himself as the face of “non-Yadav” OBCs such as the Mauryas, Kushwahas, Shakyas.
Maurya won the 2017 elections as the BJP candidate from Padrauna Assembly seat in Kushinagar district, from where he had been MLA twice in the past. He won that election with over 93,000 votes, defeating BSP’s Javed Iqbal.
Maurya, who claims to have a hold over a large section of “non-Yadav” voters, both in eastern and western UP, has claimed the support of many OBC leaders who moved with him to the BJP and who, he now claims, will leave with him.
His influence can also be ascertained by the fact that he got the BJP to let his daughter Sanghmitra contest the 2019 Lok Sabha polls from Badaun, an SP stronghold where the party had been winning for two decades. Sanghmitra defeated Akhilesh’s cousin Dharmendra Yadav.",politics
"Today in Politics: PM Modi in Jammu, will inaugurate the world’s highest railway bridge","Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Jammu on Tuesday to inaugurate a slew of development programmes and address a public meeting. This will be his second visit to Jammu and Kashmir since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019 and becomes crucial ahead of the coming Lok Sabha polls. The PM will also interact with beneficiaries of various government schemes as part of the “Viksit Bharat Viksit Jammu” programme.
The importance of the elections in J&K, which has not had an elected Assembly since 2014, was underlined by Union Minister Jitendra Singh who recently said the following in Udhampur: “We want the Prime Minister to visit J&K before the start of the election code of conduct.”
The visit is the PM’s first since the Supreme Court last December held the abrogation of Article 370, which gave special status to the erstwhile state of J&K, as constitutionally valid and went on to order the restoration of statehood and instruct the Centre to hold Assembly elections by September 2024.Advertisement

The BJP has hit the ground running in J&K. In January, the party held the first meeting of its state election committee in the Union Territory and a workshop on its countrywide “Gaon Chalo Abhiyan”.
In the 2019 polls, the BJP won two Lok Sabha seats – Jammu and Udhampur. These seats in the Jammu region are predominantly Hindu constituencies and could be easy seats to sail through this time too, with major opponents National Conference (NC), PDP and Congress not having any popular and widely recognisable faces here. Apart from this, the party is also looking at the Anantnag seat in Kashmir this time around, Sunil Sethi, the chief spokesperson of the J&K BJP unit has said.
On Tuesday, the PM will inaugurate AIIMS, Jammu; the world’s highest railway bridge over Chenab; and north India’s first river rejuvenation project — the Devika River project — in Udhampur. The 1.3 km-long rail bridge, located 359 metres above the Chenab, is 35 metres higher than the Eiffel Tower in Paris and forms a crucial link in the 111-km Katra–Banihal stretch, which forms a part of the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Railway Line (USBRL) Project. Modi will also flag off the first electric train in the Valley.

Farm agitation set to resume
A day after their fourth round of talks with the Union government, farmer leaders on Monday said they have rejected the Centre’s proposal to provide Minimum Support Price (MSP) on three pulses, maize, and cotton. They will now resume their “Dilli Chalo” march at 11 am on Wednesday.
As the BJP looks to negotiate with the farmers, it will want to douse any problem that might arise ahead of the polls as far as optics are concerned. It remains to be seen how the Centre will respond. Will there be more talks, how will the Centre deal with the protesters and can the farmers make it to Delhi? These are all questions that will come up repeatedly in the coming days.
Amit Shah in Rajasthan
Meanwhile, in Rajasthan, the BJP has fully kickstarted preparations for the parliamentary polls. On Tuesday, Union Home Minister Amit Shah will address multiple BJP meetings in the state. The party, which won 24 of the 25 seats in 2019, is aiming to clinch all the seats this time.
Party leaders said Shah would focus on the three “’clusters” of Jaipur, Udaipur, and Bikaner during the visit. Each cluster includes three Lok Sabha seats.Advertisement
The Bikaner cluster comprises Bikaner, Ganganagar and Churu constituencies, the Udaipur cluster includes Udaipur, Dungarpur and Chittorgarh, while Jaipur, Jaipur Rural and Dausa make up the Jaipur cluster.
Rahul in Raebareli
In Uttar Pradesh, Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra will make its way to the Gandhi family bastion of Raebareli on Tuesday morning. Rahul’s mother and former Congress president Sonia Gandhi is vacating the seat after four consecutive terms to contest the Rajya Sabha polls from Rajasthan. The party has won the Congress bastion in all but three Lok Sabha elections since 1951 and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s name is now doing the rounds as the new Congress candidate from the seat.

"What is holding up Opposition seat-sharing deal in Maharashtra? These 9 seats, say MVA insiders","Seat-sharing talks in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) have stalled over nine of the 48 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state. Despite several meetings and claims, the Opposition alliance’s members who are part of the INDIA alliance nationally have not yet been able to settle on a seat-sharing arrangement for these seats.
Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) recently joined the MVA, which comprises the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), Nationalist Congress Party (Sharadchandra Pawar) and the Congress. The nine seats that have become the bone of contention, according to sources, are Akola, Bhandara-Gondia, Hingoli, Kolhapur, Mumbai South Central, Mumbai North, West Nasik, Pune, and Wardha.
Nasik: Each party seems to be eyeing this north Maharashtra seat. In the 2019 polls, the undivided Shiv Sena’s Hemant Godse defeated the united NCP’s Sameer Bhujbal by more than 2.92 lakh votes. Godse has now shifted to the Shiv Sena, led by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, while Bhujbal is with Ajit Pawar’s NCP. The tension, sources in both parties said, would be resolved after each party finalises its candidates.Advertisement
Kolhapur: All three parties are staking claim for Kolhapur because they all have a sizable cadre base there. Last time, Sanjay Mandlik of the undivided Sena defeated the united NCP’s Dhananjay Mahadik by 2.7 lakh votes.

While Mandlik is now in the Sena, Mahadik went on to join the BJP and was given a Rajya Sabha berth. As per sources, Shrimant Shahu Chhatrapati who is a descendant of Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj, the fifth Chhatrapati of the Maratha empire, could be the Opposition’s unanimous candidate from the seat. The party symbol that he will contest has not been finalised, sources said.
Mumbai South Central: This urban seat is becoming a prestige battle for the Shiv Sena (UBT) as it covers Dadar, where the party is headquartered. In 2019, Rahul Shewale of the undivided Sena defeated Eknath Gaikwad of the Congress by 1.52 lakh votes. Shewale later joined the Shinde camp. Gaikwad’s daughter and Mumbai Congress chief Varsha Gaikwad is looking to contest from here while Shiv Sena (UBT) wants to field someone who can defeat Shewale.
Mumbai North West: The constituency is now represented by Shiv Sena’s Gajanan Kirtikar who defeated the Congress’s Sanjay Nirupam by more than 2.6 lakh votes in 2019. Kirtikar is now with the Shiv Sena. His son Amol, however, remained with the Sena (UBT) and is one of the party’s contenders this time. Nirupam who has criticised Thackeray several times is again demanding this seat. Thackeray has already announced observers for the Mumbai South Central and North West seats, clearly implying that his party is not willing to give in easily.Advertisement
Pune: Sources said both the Congress and the NCP were looking at this high-profile seat. In 2019, Girish Bapat of the BJP defeated Mohan Joshi of the Congress by 3.24 lakh votes. Before the BJP made a breakthrough in Pune in 2019, the seat was a traditional Congress stronghold. The Congress is citing this reason to demand it again. The NCP wants to experiment with its candidate since Sharad Pawar is influential in the larger Pune district and the areas surrounding it.

Wardha: Sharad Pawar’s NCP is said to be demanding Wardha and the Congress seems to be eyeing it too, with the local party unit trying to persuade the state leadership to not let go of its claim. The NCP argument is that the Congress has lost the seat to the BJP the last two times. But the Congress’ response is that it has a base in the constituency.
Bhandara-Gondiya: The Sharad Pawar-led group and Congress are also fighting over Bhandara-Gondiya, where Rajya Sabha MP Prafful Patel who won the seat in 2009 holds influence. Patel, who is currently the seniormost leader in Ajit Pawar’s NCP, was one of the key architects of the rebellion against Sharad Pawar last July. The Sharad Pawar group wants to wrest this and deal a blow to Ajit Pawar.
Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole hails from the same region and the party wants to field him again. In 2019, the undivided NCP’s Nana Panchabuddhe lost to the BJP’s Sunil Mendhe by around 1.97 lakh votes. Patole won the seat as a BJP candidate in 2014 but resigned from the party. In a bypoll in 2017, the NCP won the seat.Advertisement
Akola: This seat is considered one of the strongest bases of the VBA, with Ambedkar contesting from here in 2019. The division of votes between Ambedkar and Congress’s Hidayatullah Patel helped the BJP’s Sanjay Dhotre, who won it by around 2.75 lakh votes. The Congress is considering contesting its candidate from there this time too.
Hingoli: The seat in Marathwada has emerged as a point of difference between the Uddhav Sena and the Congress. In 2019, Hemant Patil of the undivided Shiv Sena defeated Subhash Wankhede of the Congress by around 2.77 lakh votes. Now, Patil has shifted to the Shiv Sena and Wankhede has returned to the Uddhav camp.",politics
"Decode Politics: As Sandeshkhali simmers, why there is unease in TMC about its political fallout","Violence in Sandeshkhali in West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district continues to remain a political hot potato, with Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) chairperson Mamata Banerjee accusing the BJP of attempting to incite a riot and the Opposition targeting the state government for not allowing its leaders to visit the area.
National Commission for Women (NCW) chairperson Rekha Sharma on Monday said 18 complaints had been received from women in Sandeshkhali, of which two are complaints of rape. On February 12, Union Minister Smriti Irani alleged that “Hindu” women from lower castes had been “raped” regularly by TMC workers. The state police ruled out a communal angle in the violence.
What happened in Sandeshkhali last month?
On January 5, three Enforcement Directorate (ED) officers were injured in an attack when a team of the central agency was on its way to raid the home of local TMC strongman Sheikh Shahjahan in the alleged ration scam. Shahjahan has been absconding since then.Advertisement
Also Read | Reeling from Sandeshkhali unrest, TMC moves to control damage as BJP, CPI(M) turn up heat
What triggered the latest round of violence?
On February 8, over a month since Shahjahan disappeared, a group of local women wielding brooms and sticks took to the streets of Sandeshkhali and demanded the immediate arrest of the TMC strongman and his associates Shibu Prasad Hazra and Uttam Sardar. The following day, the women protesters set a poultry farm owned by Hazra on fire, with several local people alleging that the poultry farm functioned from a land the TMC leader had grabbed. The farm had become a centre for several illicit operations, they alleged, with women alleging Shahjahan and his supporters had been exploiting them for years.
This sparked a political war of words between the TMC and the Opposition, especially the BJP, which attempted to paint this as an example of the deteriorating law-and-order situation in the state. Last Friday, Congress and BJP delegations were stopped from visiting Sandeshkhali.

What has been the TMC’s response?Advertisement
Banerjee has accused the BJP and the RSS of fomenting trouble in the area. On February 15, the CM told the state Assembly, “It has come to light how BJP workers have been brought and how violence has been instigated in the area (Sandeshkhali). The primary target was (TMC leader) Sheikh Shahjahan and ED entered the area targeting him. Following this, they ousted everyone from there and fabricated an Adivasis versus minorities fight.”
Alleging a “sinister design” at play,” she added, “It is not new. The RSS has a base there. Riots took place there seven to eight years ago. It is one of the vulnerable riot spots. We handled the situation strongly during Saraswati Puja or else there were other plans.”
The BJP has dismissed these allegations. “The TMC now is trying to damage control by saying all these things. The main thing is that in Basirhat, people have been tortured for the last 10 years and now people are revolting and the TMC will have to face that heat in the coming Lok Sabha election,” said a senior leader of the Opposition party.
Why is the TMC worried about Sandeshkhali?
In short, polarisation along community and religious lines and a shrinking political footprint. A TMC leader said that as per the last Census report, 30% of Sandeshkhali’s population belongs to the minority community while 30% are Dalits and 26% are Adivasis. The TMC’s current Basirhat MP Nusrat Jahan, a Bengali film actress, is not a hands-on representative and according to party insiders, her popularity has taken a hit. This is why the party is feeling the heat as it believes its hold on the constituency is tenuous at the moment.Advertisement
Mamata’s comment about the BJP attempting to manufacture an “Adivasis versus Muslims” narrative is being viewed as an attempt to push back against the Opposition party’s onslaught and ensure that the TMC’s hold in the constituency does not fracture. If the BJP manages to consolidate itself among Dalits and Adivasis, the TMC’s footprint in the area is expected to shrink as then it will be able to count only on votes from the minority community.
A senior TMC leader who is one of the party’s founder members and helped it grow in Basirhat said, “What the CM said is true but what she did not say is that the current situation in Sandeshkhali is the result of our strategy here. Not only Sandeshkhali, but neighbouring areas such as Haroa and Minakhan also have strongmen from the minority community. This has given space to the RSS to consolidate their presence here. In Sandeshkhali, for the last three to four years, the RSS has regularly organised camps and TMC leaders from the majority community allowed them to grow.”

Did a TMC minister’s arrest weaken the party?
Both a TMC leader and a local CPI(M) functionary said the ruling party had become vulnerable since the arrest of minister Jyotipriya Mullick in the alleged ration scam.Advertisement
A ruling party leader said, “After Jyotipriya Mallick’s arrest, all strongmen of TMC became weak. Now if the party cannot control the damage, it may lose the Basirhat Lok Sabha constituency. That is the main headache for us now.”
A CPI(M) district committee leader said Mallick used to control North 24 Parganas for the TMC and appointed strongmen like Sheikh Shahjahan in Sandeshkhali as well as Minakhan and Haroa. “They transformed farmlands into fisheries and were involved in widespread extortion and corruption. Farmlands were captured and turned into fisheries. No farmer got any compensation.”
On the defensive over the land-grabbing allegations, local TMC leaders last Friday started a survey in the area to identify all those who have not received compensation for their land.",politics

Showcasing Modi
The focus of the BJP’s convention remained on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who dominated its proceedings and the speeches made by the party leaders besides the cutouts put up at its venue.Advertisement
PM Modi added a dash of ideology to his desired figure of 370 seats that he set for the BJP, saying that each party worker should spend all his energies until the polls on this target. He said this was not just a number but a tribute to Jana Sangh founder Syama Prasad Mookerji, who died in confinement in Jammu and Kashmir during his agitation for the revocation of Article 370, which gave J&K special status.
The Modi government scrapped Article 370 in August 2019.

Ram Temple
The BJP’s National Council issued a detailed statement on the consecration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, underlining the point that the party would have it as its key poll issue, even as it talked about the development work and welfare measures undertaken by the Modi government. It reflected PM Modi’s recurring pitch that development and Hindutva have to go together.

INDIA in crosshairs
The convention also became a platform for unleashing a scathing attack on the Congress party as well as the Opposition INDIA bloc. Union Home Minister Amit Shah chose to attack the INDIA alliance, framing the upcoming elections as a battle between a democratic BJP, where a “tea seller could become the PM”, and several dynastic parties which, he alleged, hoped only to make a son or a daughter the PM or the CM, and stifled talent and hard work of other leaders and workers not belonging to their dominating families. The PM chose to target the Congress in particular.
Modi pitch
PM Modi himself underlined in his address to the conclave on the opening day that the lotus symbol will be their candidate in all the seats throughout the country. It was thus made clear to the BJP leaders and workers that the PM’s leadership and the party’s symbol are all that should matter to them, irrespective of who their candidates would be.Advertisement
This marked a continuum with the PM Modi’s speech at a rally in Bilaspur before the Chhattisgarh Assembly polls, held in November 2023, where the PM told the gathering that they should focus only on the lotus symbol and not on individual candidates.

Symbolic projection of collective face
While keeping the focus on PM Modi, the BJP convention sought to project symbolically a collective face of the party organisation. BJP president J P Nadda gave a detailed address on the opening day, highlighting the spectacular rise of the party and praising party workers for making the organisation powerful at the grassroots.
The resolution attacking the Congress and the Opposition, which was moved by Shah Sunday before the PM gave his concluding address, had three seconders — Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar, Madhya Pradesh CM Mohan Yadav, and Union Minister Arjun Munda. All three addressed the audience.
The cutouts set up by the BJP in different parts of the national capital featured the faces of even party veterans like L K Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi in welcome messages to the participants. PM Modi however remained at the centre of the mega BJP event and its political message on the eve of the Lok Sabha polls.",politics
"In fresh jolt to INDIA, Akhilesh skips Rahul Yatra  in Amethi as SP raises seat-sharing heat on Cong","In another setback to the Opposition INDIA alliance in Uttar Pradesh, Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav gave a miss to Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Amethi Monday, even as he is set to stay away from the Yatra in Raebareli too.
Akhilesh announced Monday morning that he will join Rahul’s Yatra only after the finalisation of seat-sharing between the SP and the Congress for the UP seats for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Hours later, the SP unilaterally announced its candidates for 11 more seats, taking the total number of its nominees that it has declared so far to 27 out of the state’s 80 seats.
SP spokesperson Rajendra Chauhary also told The Indian Express that the party has offered 17 seats to the Congress.Advertisement
Akhilesh’s announcement came a fortnight after he wrote to Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge to assure him about his joining the Yatra either in Amethi or Rae Bareli, while wishing success for the UP leg of the Yatra.

The Amethi and Raebareli parliamentary constituencies are among the Congress’s few remaining strongholds in UP.
On February 6, Akhilesh had received the Congress leadership’s invitation to join Rahul’s cross-country Yatra that entered UP on February 16. While asserting that he will join it in Amethi or Raebareli, the SP chief also claimed that the INDIA alliance along with his party’s strategy centred on “PDA” – Picchde (backward classes or OBCs), Dalits and Alpsankhyak (minorities) – will create a “new history of victory”.
Rahul’s Yatra traversed Amethi Monday, where he along with Kharge addressed a public rally at Babuganj. Rahul stayed in Amethi for the night and will resume his Yatra for neighbouring Rae Bareli on Tuesday.Advertisement
Speaking to reporters in Lucknow, Akhilesh said that the seat-sharing talks with the INDIA partner Congress were continuing. “Several rounds of dialogues have happened and several lists (of seats) have been exchanged. When seat distribution will be finalised, Samajwadi Party will join Congress’s Nyay Yatra,” he said.
Akhilesh’s announcement was clearly aimed at increasing the pressure on the Congress over the seat-sharing exercise.

Last month, the SP supremo had sprung a surprise by unilaterally offering 11 Lok Sabha seats for the Congress in UP. Caught off guard, the Congress said the seat-sharing talks with the SP were still on. Sources said the Congress has demanded more seats. On January 30, the SP announced its candidates for 16 seats.
On the SP’s bid to offer 17 seats to the Congress, Rajendra Chaudhary pointed out that this marked an increase fromAdvertisement
11 seats offered earlier to the latter. “Congress has to give consent for contesting these 17 seats, following which seat-sharing will be finalised. Akhilesh ji will join Congress’ Yatra in Rae Bareli only after that.”
The SP’s Raebareli unit has also not received any communication from the party leadership so far about Akhilesh’s visit.
The Apna Dal (K)’s leader and SP MLA Pallavi Patel and her party leaders had joined the Yatra in Varanasi on Saturday. Sources said that her move had upset the SP leadership.
Congress spokesperson Anshu Awasthi said, “In the prevailing situation, protecting democracy is more important than seat-sharing. Everyone including SP will have to show a big heart to strengthen the INDIA alliance.”
Awasthi expressed hope that Akhilesh will join the Yatra.Advertisement
Dealing a blow to the INDIA bloc in UP recently, RLD president Jayant Chaudhary, Akhilesh’s key UP ally, crossed over to the BJP-led NDA.
The support of the SP in Amethi and Rae Bareli is crucial for the Congress because the grand old party had regularly managed to win these seats over the past few decades despite its poor show in the state due to the former’s backing among other factors.
The SP had last contested the Lok Sabha elections in Amethi in 1999, when it had fielded Kamarujjama Fauzi who had finished fourth with 2.67 per cent votes. Sonia Gandhi was elected there with 67 per cent vote share.
In the 2004 polls, the SP gave a walkover to Rahul in Amethi by not fielding its candidate. It was Rahul’s electoral debut which he won. The SP had fielded its candidate against Sonia in Raebareli though, where she again won.Advertisement
The SP did not field its candidates in Amethi and Raebareli in 2009 and 2014 against Rahul and Sonia, with both leaders clinching their respective seats smoothly.
In 2019, when the SP had tied up with the BSP and the RLD, their alliance again gave a walkover to Rahul in Amethi and Sonia in Raebareli. While Sonia Gandhi retained her seat, Rahul lost to the BJP’s Smriti Irani in Amethi.
Sonia has now bid farewell to electoral politics and her Raebareli seat, deciding to file nomination for the February 27 Rajya Sabha polls from Rajasthan. She is likely to be replaced by her daughter Priyanka Gandhi as the Congress candidate from Raebareli in the Lok Sabha polls.",politics
"As Kamal Nath ponders next move, the up and mostly downs of his time as MP Congress chief","As speculation swirls around Kamal Nath’s future in the Congress, sources close to him have indicated that he is in a dilemma about switching to the BJP. The former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister has seen his stock in the party take a hit following the debacle in the Assembly elections in December in which the BJP bagged 163 seats while the Congress, widely expected to do well, saw its tally plummet to 66 constituencies.
Nath is a nine-time MP from his pocket borough Chhindwara and gave up the seat in 2019, when his son Nakul got elected from there. The year before he took over as the state Congress president after the party high command tasked him with steering the faction-ridden Madhya Pradesh Pradesh Congress Committee (MPPCC) before the 2018 Assembly elections. Nath’s tenure, however, was filled with a high point and mostly lows.
While the 2018 Assembly election victory was one of his high points, the subsequent allegations of centralisation of power was a low point and his tenure ended with the Assembly poll debacle last year. Subsequently, Jitu Patwari replaced him at the helm of the MPPCC.Advertisement
The 2018 success
Nath took over as MPCC chief in May 2018, six months ahead of the state polls. The Congress at the time lacked organisation in most districts and was riddled with factionalism. Some of its party offices lacked even basic infrastructure such as toilets.
Taking a leaf out of his own book, Nath pushed for block and booth-level management, a strategy that had helped him successfully retain the Chhindwara seat for four decades.
Political Pulse | Gandhi loyalist Kamal Nath, his MP-son likely to leave Congress for BJP
Nath’s skills as an astute politician and negotiator helped him overcome factionalism and unite the state Congress. Once the party was united, albeit temporarily, the Chhindwara strongman is said to have introduced a data-driven approach to campaigning and decision making within the MPCC. He utilised surveys and analytics to target specific demographics and introduced tailor-made messaging.
One of the most important contributions of the former CM was projecting himself as a Hanuman devotee and taking the party towards soft Hindutva, a ploy that was at the time labelled as an effective counter to the BJP’s Hindutva strategy and credited with helping the Congress shed its “anti-Hindu tag”. It was also seen as Nath’s ability to navigate the party successfully through a difficult ideological debate.Advertisement
The lows
But the glow from that electoral victory proved short-lived as 15 months into its tenure, the Congress government led by Nath faced a rebellion led by Jyotiraditya Scindia and eventually collapsed.
It was a significant setback for the party and the instability within the Congress raised doubts about Nath’s ability to navigate internal dynamics and political alliances. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP swept Madhya Pradesh, winning 28 of the 29 Lok Sabha seats. The Congress managed to retain only Chhindwara.
Party insiders said a section of the MPCC was also critical of Nath’s leadership style and decision-making process. Adding to the party’s woes and creating hurdles in the unity and cohesion of the state unit, allegations of centralisation of power and lack of consultation were levelled against Nath.
The former CM, as the election in-charge of the state, is said to have taken a back seat in the run-up to the Assembly polls last. He shared an uneasy equation with All India Congress Committee (AICC) Madhya Pradesh in-charge Jai Prakash Aggarwal, who refused to name him as the party’s CM face and was eventually replaced by Randeep Surjewala two months before the elections.Advertisement
Nath, who was anxious about the party breaking up, took the lead in the ticket distribution process but this led to a massive rebellion by several Congress leaders whom he was unable to pacify. He was also unsuccessful in stitching meaningful alliances with other INDIA bloc members. His “Akhilesh wakhilesh chhodo (Leave all this talk about Akhilesh)” comment had consequences at the national level as questions were raised over the effectiveness of the INDIA alliance of which both Congress and the Samajwadi Party (SP) led by Akhilesh Yadav are a part.",politics
Today in Politics: SC to hear Sharad Pawar’s plea against Ajit; Rahul v/s Smriti in Amethi,"The battle of the Pawars is heating up inside the Maharashtra Assembly and at the Supreme Court.
Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar on Thursday ruled on the disqualification pleas that the Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawar-led groups had filed against each other. After the rebellion by the Ajit Pawar group in July 2023 and the swearing-in of nine MLAs among them as ministers, the Sharad Pawar faction filed disqualification petitions against the MLAs.
Later, it filed two more disqualification petitions against 20 and 11 MLAs respectively. In September 2023, the Ajit Pawar group went on an offensive and filed disqualification petitions against 10 members of the Sharad Pawar group.Advertisement
In his ruling, Narwekar declared the Ajit Pawar’s faction as “the real political party” and held that Ajit Pawar’s assertions about vote share and majority in the legislature were not disputed by the Sharad Pawar faction.
“Ajit Pawar faction constituted the will of the party,” he underlined.
Narwekar’s ruling comes two weeks after the Election Commission declared the Ajit Pawar-led faction as the real NCP and allotted it the party’s clock symbol.
Sharad Pawar, whose faction is now called NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar), termed Narvekar’s decision as “an injustice”, one that was made through a ”settlement.”Advertisement
On Friday, Sharad Pawar moved the Supreme Court for an urgent listing of his plea challenging the EC’s ruling that recognised the Ajit Pawar-led faction as the real NCP.
A bench of Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and KV Viswanathan is likely to hear the matter.
In context: The issue of what constituted the “real party” was also debated earlier in the case of the two Senas — one led by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde; the other led by Uddhav Thackeray. The situation was also similar: Shinde, like Ajit Pawar, led a rebellion and claimed he had the maximum organisational strength. Both the factions of the Sena had accused each other of defying the party’s whip over the election of a Speaker and the trust vote (through which Shinde proved his majority) that was held on July 4, 2022. They then went on to seek disqualification of the MLAs from the opposite side.In May 2023, the Supreme Court ruled the Shinde faction as the official Sena and gave the responsibility of deciding on the disqualification petitions of MLAs — 34 in total — from the two rival Senas to Narwekar.
In January this year, Narweker ruled that the Eknath Shinde faction was the “real Shiv Sena” as it had the support of the majority of the party’s MLAs. The Uddhav Thackeray group has moved the SC challenging Narwekar’s order; the matter is still being heard.
Sandeshkhali matter in SCAdvertisement
The SC on Monday is scheduled to hear a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking a court-monitored CBI or SIT probe into the allegations of sexual assault on women by members of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in West Bengal’s Sandeshkhali village.
A bench of Justice BV Nagarathna and Justice Augustine George Masih will hear the PIL that has been filed by advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava.

The plea, filed by Srivastava in his personal capacity, also seeks compensation for the victims of the Sandeshkhali violence and action against officials of the West Bengal Police for alleged dereliction of duty.
The plea seeks transfer of the probe and subsequent trial outside West Bengal. Besides, it seeks an inquiry by a three-judge committee as done in the case of Manipur sexual violence cases.Advertisement
Sandeshkhali, a village in North 24 Parganas district, has seen protests over allegations of sexual abuse of women by a local TMC leader named Shajahan Sheikh. Shajahan is currently absconding.
Rahul v/s Smriti
Amethi in Uttar Pradesh is bracing for an interesting face-off on Monday.
Union minister Smriti Irani, who currently represents Amethi, will be on a four-day visit to the seat beginning Monday. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra is also set to enter the town the same day.
Gandhi was Amethi MP for 15 years until Irani defeated him in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls with a margin of 35,000 votes.Advertisement
While Irani will hold interactions with residents of several villages, Gandhi will hold a road show and public meeting in Amethi town.
Gandhi’s comments will be closely tracked, as the Congress once again finds itself having to deal with buzz of its senior leaders deserting it.
While it was the news of former Madhy Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath and his son Nakul Nath allegedly looking to join the BJP since Friday, rumours about senior MP Manish Tewari leaving the party did the rounds on Sunday.
Meanwhile Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also head to UP on Monday to lay the foundation stone of the Kalki Dham Temple in the Sambhal district of the state. He will also address a gathering subsequently.Advertisement
The temple is being constructed by the Shri Kalki Dham Nirman Trust whose chairman is Acharya Pramod Krishnam. Krishnam was expelled by the Congress for “anti-party remarks” earlier this month.

‘Akhilesh Yadav ignoring PDA’: 5-time MP Saleem Shervani resigns as SP general secretary,"Five-time former MP Saleem Shervani on Sunday tendered his resignation from the post of national general secretary of the Samajwadi Party, alleging that party president Akhilesh Yadav does not give any importance to the PDA (Pichhda, Dalit and Alpasankhyak) communities.
In his resignation letter, Shervani asked how the SP is different from the BJP and that the party’s candidates for the Rajya Sabha elections on February 27 didn’t have a Muslim name, as a result of which the community is feeling “ignored”.
Shervani is the third leader in the past one week who has openly rebelled against the party after national general secretary Swami Prasad Maurya resigned from his post “for feeling undermined”.Advertisement
The second was SP MLA and Apna Dal (Kamervadi) party leader Pallavi Patel, who had said that she would not vote in the upcoming Rajya Sabha polls. Patel and her party leaders carrying the Apna Dal flag, joined the Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s Yatra in Varanasi on Saturday.
The SP, which is likely to win three of the 10 Rajya Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh that are falling vacant, has nominated former chief secretary Alok Ranjan, actor-turned-politician Jaya Bachchan — both Kayasths — and Ramji Lal Suman, a Dalit.
In the letter sent to Akhilesh, Shervani wrote, “In the recent past, I have held discussions with you about the condition of Muslims, and I have tried to convey to you that the community is feeling ignored, and is losing confidence in the party. The gulf between the party and the community is increasing, and they are looking for a true ‘guide’. I have also tried to convey to you that their support shouldn’t be undermined. The feeling among the Muslim community is that no secular front is willing to take up their real issues. As per the party’s tradition, I had requested you for a seat for the community in the Rajya Sabha. But the candidates announced didn’t have a Muslim name. This gives rise to the question about how you are different from the BJP?”
“The attempts to create a strong Opposition alliance seem to be proving to be cheating, and no one is serious about it. It seems the Opposition is more inclined towards infighting instead of fighting against the party in power and its wrong policies. Secularism has become a pretence. The Muslims of India, especially those from UP, have never asked for anything else except a life of equality, respect, and their rights. But it seems the party finds this demand to be too much. The party doesn’t have an answer to this. Hence I feel I can’t bring about a change in the condition of Muslims in the party… Therefore, I am resigning from the post of national general secretary of the party. In the next few weeks, I will take a decision about my future in politics,” he added.Advertisement
Shervani, a five-time MP from Badaun, had rejoined the SP in October 2020. He was elected MP four times on the SP symbol, and once from Congress. He had quit the Congress and joined the SP in the nineties.
He went back to the Congress in 2009 after he was denied a ticket by the SP, which chose Akhilesh’s cousin Dharmendra Yadav to contest from the Badaun segment.
Speaking to The Indian Express on Sunday, Shervani said, “It should not be interpreted that I have resigned because I wasn’t named for the Rajya Sabha. When Akhilesh ji sent Muslim leader Javed Ali to the Rajya Sabha, I didn’t say anything because I felt the community was represented. Now, when he (Akhilesh) had a chance to send a Muslim to the Rajya Sabha, he didn’t.”
Other party leaders from the Dalit, backward, and Muslim communities have been speaking about the party missing an opportunity by sending two upper-caste leaders to the Rajya Sabha. “The whole election is being fought on PDA pitch, but when the time came for the party’s commitment to the communities, it decided to send upper castes to the Rajya Sabha. Several leaders are feeling disappointed at this,” said a senior OBC leader from the party.Advertisement
About Patel’s allegation that the party was ignoring PDA, Akhilesh had Wednesday said in Mainpuri, “…I hope our ally (Apna Dal-Kamervadi) will strengthen the fight for PDA. Several Rajya Sabha seats will fall vacant in the future. The PDA fight is not getting weakened due to one round of Rajya Sabha elections.”
When contacted, SP national spokesperson Rajendra Choudhary said, “The PDA communities are not being ignored. The three nominations for the Rajya Sabha include one Dalit and one woman. In the last Rajya Sabha polls, Muslim leader Javed Ali was sent to the Upper House of Parliament. In the recent MLC polls too, we sent Muslims to the Legislative Council in UP. There is no question of ignoring the PDA.”",politics
New TN Cong chief K Selvaperunthagai: Tamil nationalism to Dalit activism to Kharge’s pick,"The All India Congress Committee (AICC) leadership’s decision to replace K S Alagiri with K Selvaperunthagai as the Tamil Nadu party chief has evoked mixed reactions among the state party leaders owing to Selvaperunthagai’s vocal position on the Dalit issues and his past association with Tamil nationalism or even being labelled as an “LTTE sympathiser”.
The Congress MLA from Sriperumbudur, Selvaperunthagai had been an employee of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) who turned to Dalit activism and later served as a legislator of the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK).
Selvaperunthagai edged out two party leaders — Karur MP S Jothimani and former IAS officer Sasikanth Senthil, both considered close to Rahul Gandhi – in the race to become the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) president.

அன்புச் சகோதரியின் வாழ்த்துகளுக்கு மிக்க நன்றி. https://t.co/yCtovwfo9o
— Selvaperunthagai K (@SPK_TNCC) February 18, 2024
A senior TNPCC leader said Senthil and Jothimani are “known for their diligent and no-nonsense approach but need grooming”. “There are concerns over Jothimani’s skills to unify factions and maintain alliances. On the other hand, Senthil can be a transformative leader for the party akin to the BJP’s K Annamalai but he needs to integrate with the state and district-level units of the party,” the leader said.Advertisement
Selvaperunthagai’s appointment was made after AICC chief Mallikarjun Kharge reportedly insisted on having a Dalit face for the party in the state. Despite Senthil being in consideration, the MLA’s elevation shows how Kharge had the final say in the matter.
A senior state Congress leader, who is closely associated with the AICC, denied any such differences in the top leadership, especially at a time when the party is seeing multiple high-level defections involving senior leaders like former Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan.
“A senior MLA from Tamil Nadu has met senior BJP leaders over the last two days seeking to contest the Kanyakumari or Trichy Lok Sabha seat after the Congress refused to entertain her demand. These instances lead to questions about loyalty and unity among the rank and file of the Congress. In such a scenario, how is Selvaperunthagai any lesser? He is neither anyone who has disproportionately benefited from the Gandhis nor an average face and is one of the most active faces of the party in the Assembly,” the leader said.
However, a section of Congress leaders argued that the party high command overlooked his past affiliations and the “LTTE sympathiser” tag while making the appointment. “He was an LTTE sympathiser and this shaped his political decisions. I do not know how they (high command) ignored this,” a party leader, who did not wish to be named, said.Advertisement
In the 2016 polls, former four-time Congress MLA from Sriperumbudur D Yasoda protested after the party decided to field Selvaperunthagai from the constituency, alleging that he was pro-LTTE. Reports also emerged that some Congress leaders were caught unaware over the party’s move.
Another leader countered the argument, saying “everyone in the state has sympathy or empathy for the LTTE”. “Some do it silently but Selvaperunthagai has been vocal,” the leader said.
Some Congress leaders point out that the Sriperumbudur MLA’s effective role as the party floor leader in the state Assembly since the DMK came to power in 2021 and his strong opposition to both the AIADMK and the BJP played an important role in his elevation to the post of the TNPCC chief. Selvaperunthagai’s proximity to the DMK was also seen as a factor that tilted the scales in his favour.

A senior TNPCC leader, though initially expressing surprise over the appointment, said he would support Selvaperunthagai as it was imperative to focus on his opposition to the BJP rather than his past. A section of leaders also sees him as a figure of resilience for warding off attempts by other parties to effect defection.Advertisement
A senior DMK minister said Selvaperunthagai was “one of the finest MLAs” in the alliance. “We have many allies and MLAs but very few like Selvaperunthagai fight the AIADMK and BJP consistently in the House,” he said. The DMK rules the state in alliance with the Congress, VCK and the Left parties.
Bringing in Selvaperunthagai to steer the state Congress unit is also being seen as the party leadership’s attempt to blend its values with the realities of regional politics in order to consolidate the party’s position against the BJP and the AIADMK. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the DMK-led alliance had won 38 of the 39 seats in the state.
Former TNPCC chief S Thirunavakkarasar, who himself had switched from the AIADMK and the BJP to the Congress, said there was no point criticising someone’s past as everyone has one.
Thirunavakkarsar said the Sriperumbudur MLA’s elevation is significant as he is the first leader from the Dalit community since L Ilaya Perumal in 1979 to be appointed as the state Congress chief. “Selvaperunthagai’s achievements as an MLA, SC wing president and floor leader are commendable. As a part of the Congress’ property recovery committee, he was instrumental in the recovery of over 200 properties the party had lost. I hope he can take everyone – juniors and seniors – together while taking the party forward,” he said.",politics
Bihar Dalit firebrand and disqualified CPI-ML (Liberation) MLA known for ‘Sadak Pe School’ campaign: Who is Manoj Manzil?,"The CPI (ML) Liberation’s first-time MLA, Manoj Manzil, has lost his membership of the Bihar Legislative Assembly following his conviction in a murder case. He is one of the 12 CPI(ML) Liberation MLAs in the state.
The 40-year-old Dalit leader, Manzil was elected from the Agiaon constituency in the Bhojpur district in the 2020 Assembly polls.
A local court in Arrah recently sentenced Manzil to life imprisonment along with 22 others in a 2015 case of murder of one J P Singh. Manzil, who also faces 30 other cases, is expected to challenge the local court’s verdict in the Patna High Court.Advertisement

The murder case which led to his disqualification as an MLA was linked to the campaign of the 2015 Assembly polls. At a public meeting of the CPI(ML) Liberation that was being held in Badgaon village near Azeembad then, party members were said to have learnt about the murder of a party worker Satish Yadav.
In retaliation, the CPI(ML) Liberation members were accused of killing a local upper caste Rajput resident J P Singh.
The CPI (ML) Liberation has called Manzil’s conviction “an act of judicial massacre and part of feudalistic conspiracy”.
“We are still not sure if the body was of JP Singh’s or not…The other cases against him are being pursued because of Manzil’s activism for the poor. They are politically motivated,” the CPI (ML) Liberation’s Bihar media in-charge Kumar Parvez said.Advertisement
The party’s Bihar secretary Kunal said its workers are planning to visit every Bhojpur village between February 19 and February 25 to protest against the court verdict and demand justice for Manzil.

Activist-politician
Over the years, Bhojpur has come to be associated with a range of socialist and farmer movements in Bihar.
Manzil too started out with student activism. He was associated with the All India Students Association (AISA) when he was studying at the Veer Kunwar Singh University in Arrah.
Since 2006, Manzil started gaining ground in Bhojpur, becoming popular among local residents for the work he was doing. His “Sadak Pe School (school on the street)” campaign was also started around this time. As part of the initiative, he would organise teaching lessons for students along roads and highways to question the education system in Bihar.Advertisement
He would flag the “classrooms-less, building-less and teachers-scarce” education system in Bihar. The campaign gained a lot of traction and went on to be noticed by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar as well.

Due to his fierce activism, Manzil has gained the reputation of being a “crusader” against the “poor education system” in the state.
With the CPI(ML) Liberation having its support base in Bhojpur, Manzil soon started emerging as a popular party firebrand and was fielded in the polls.
Despite his arrest at the investigation’s preliminary stage in the murder of JP Singh, Manzil was fielded in the 2015 Assembly polls from Agiaon, but he polled only 30,000 votes and lost. He went on to win the 2020 polls from the seat against the JD(U)’s Prabhunath Prasad by a margin of over 37,000 votes.Advertisement
As per his 2020 election affidavit, the cases that Manzil faces include murder, attempt to murder, criminal intimidation and cheating. He has assets worth over Rs 3 lakh. Manzil’s wife, Sheela Kumari, is also an active CPI (ML) Liberation member.",politics
"Eye on LS polls, Telangana Cong looks to double down on schemes after caste survey","The Congress government in Telangana has got a resolution passed in the state Assembly unanimously for conducting a door-to-door caste survey covering all communities in the state.
The A Revanth Reddy-led government has promised to utilise the data from the caste survey to target the state’s large Backward Classes (BC) population by extending welfare schemes and assistance to benefit them economically, socially and educationally.
More importantly, the data would be used to increase the quota for BC candidates in local bodies to empower them politically. This would be a significant move, as in the November elections that brought the Congress to power, a significant chunk of BC voters appear to have shifted allegiance to it from the then incumbent Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS). Naturally, the Congress aim is to keep the BC population — which is reported to be around 52-56% in the state — on its side, ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.Advertisement
Chief Minister Revanth Reddy has already promised to increase the quota for BCs in local bodies. “BCs will become the rulers in this state,” he said in the Assembly after the resolution to hold the caste survey was passed.
“The survey data will help us extend support to BCs, STs and SCs, by providing them financial assistance, while improving their social condition, provide them education-related facilities, scholarships, etc, and create more employment opportunities,” said BC welfare minister Ponnam Prabhakar.
In its Telangana election manifesto, the Congress had promised to increase BC reservations in local bodies from the existing 23% to 42% — which would create about 23,973 new political leadership positions for BCs in panchayats and municipalities — while also ensuring sub-categorisation within the BC reservation in local bodies besides providing 42% reservation for BCs in government contracts for civil construction and maintenance. If this plan succeeds without getting entangled in legal hurdles, it is expected to create a huge support base among BCs for the party.
The Congress government has also promised to spend Rs 1 lakh crore in five years on BC welfare; a BC sub-plan named after Mahatma Jyotiba Phule; a separate Most Backward Classes (MBC) welfare ministry to oversee the development of MBC castes; establishment of separate corporations for all BC castes; up to Rs 10 lakh in interest and collateral free loans for BC youth to establish small businesses or pursue higher education; and reduction in the age limit, from 57 to 50 years, for availing old-age pension for all communities engaged in “caste occupations” — a move that is expected to cover a large number of BCs under the pension umbrella.Advertisement
Immediately after the BRS (then called TRS) stormed to power after the formation of the Telangana state in 2014, it conducted a social-economic survey called the Samagra Kutumba Survey. While the BRS government never revealed the results, it used the data to identify BCs, SCs, STs, the socially and economically backward classes and weaker sections, and target specific welfare schemes at these groups, like the sheep distribution scheme for the Yadavs and the Kurumas, who are BCs.
The Congress government wants to create a more comprehensive and all-inclusive plan for the weaker sections, for which data from the caste survey will be of great help, Deputy CM Bhatti Vikramarka said Saturday. “Once we have the data, we’ll be able to implement the BC Declaration in our manifesto in a proper way, and will announce a separate budget for BCs,” he said.
There are 134 BC communities in Telangana. The Congress is expected to try and unite them in its favour by agreeing to the demands of BC leaders and announcing quotas for them across sectors, including politics and education, based on the numerical strength of each BC community.
During the election campaign in November, leaders representing the Golla Kurumas (Yadavs), Gouds, Munnuru Kapus, Padmashalis, Mudirajs, Rajaka and other castes, had attended public meeting with leaders of several political parties, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the BJP, in which they had demanded a caste-based survey to identify the exact number of people in each BC community. Aware of their demands, the Congress government wants to implement caste-specific benefits as early as possible.Advertisement
While courting the powerful Mudiraj community, it wants to move them, along with the Mutrasi and the Tenugollu communities, from the BC-D category to the BC-A group, which will allow the government to give them higher reservation percentages.
For the Gangaputras, the government wants to set up a Telangana Fisheries Development Board, with the power to resolve pending issues such as fishing rights among the fisher folk, while also taking up fisheries development activities such as promotion of aquaculture, captive seed nurseries and marketing infrastructure.
For the Yadavs and the Kurumas, there would be a second phase of sheep distribution. For the Gouds, the government promises to allocate 5 acres in each village to plant oil palms, and a 90% subsidy on palm tree saplings and drip irrigation infrastructure. It also wants to increase the reservation for Gouds in liquor shop licenses from the existing 15% to 25%, and to rename Jangaon district Sardar Sarvai Papanna Goud Jangaon district.
For the Munnur Kapus, a Telangana Munnuru Kapu Corporation would be set up to provide subsidised loans to encourage the youth towards entrepreneurship. For the Padmashalis, mega powerloom clusters will be set up in Jagityal, Narayanpet and Bhongir, along with 90% subsidies on power looms and accessories given to their Padmashali owners.Advertisement
Depending on their respective family trades, the Vishwakarmas would be provided with toolkits for barbers, goldsmiths, blacksmiths, carpenters and potters at 90% subsidy, along with land assigned in urban areas to set up their shops. Youths of the Rajakas — a caste that is a huge vote bank for the Congress — would be given a subsidy of Rs 10 lakh to establish laundry services in the cities.
The Opposition MLAs have expressed doubts over the Congress’s commitment to the welfare of the BCs. They point to the fact that in the November 2023 elections, the party had fielded the lowest number of BC candidates — 20 — among the contenders. In contrast, the BJP had fielded 39 candidates, and the BRS 24. BRS leader T Harish Rao said the Congress should announce that it is committed to using the caste survey data for the welfare of BCs and weaker sections, spelling out his party’s suspicion of the move.",politics
Today in Politics: Modi to set BJP’s LS poll roadmap at key conclave; farmers up ante on eve of talks with Centre,"The BJP is concluding its two-day National Council meeting Sunday, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi set to deliver the valedictory address – a speech that would draw the contours of the party’s campaign in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.
In his Sunday speech, the PM is likely to again exhort BJP leaders and rank and file from across the country to go all out to achieve the target of 370 seats set by him for the polls.
On Saturday, the BJP conclave adopted a resolution titled “Viksit Bharat – Modi ki Guarantee” and hailed PM Modi for having “effectively implemented the concept of Ram Rajya in the last 10 years”. BJP president J P Nadda, Defence Minister and senior leader Rajnath Singh said Modi would return to power for a third straight term with a roadmap for expanding the government’s welfare and development programmes that “have been reaching every home”.Advertisement
On the opening day of the crucial BJP meeting, setting clear targets for the BJP in the countdown to the elections, PM Modi said that party workers should see a target of 370 Lok Sabha seats as their tribute to Jana Sangh founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee, and not just as a number, as Liz Mathew and Vikas Pathak reported.
Mookerjee had campaigned against Article 370, demanding complete integration of Jammu and Kashmir with India. In August 2019, the Modi government ensured the abrogation of Article 370, ending the special status of J&K.
The BJP’s political resolution also attacked the Congress, saying people lost their trust in the party quickly wherever it was in power and brought back the BJP, a reference to states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.
A host of BJP leaders highlighted the government’s development and cultural measures, and various initiatives for South India, farmers and Sikhs during their remarks on the resolution.Advertisement
Amid protests by a section of farmers, Rajnath Singh said in his remarks while proposing the resolution that no government has done as much for farmers as the Modi government. “Farmers are no less than family for the Prime Minister,” he said.
The resolution also accused the Opposition INDIA bloc of engaging in caste-based divisive politics and contrasted their approach with Modi’s assertion that the country has only four castes – the poor, farmers, women and the youth.
The government’s initiatives have empowered these four “castes” as they are at the centre of its every scheme, it stated.
Under Modi’s leadership, not only has the Ram Temple been constructed but he has also realised the dream of “Ram Rajya” in totality by working to empower all sections of society, the resolution said.
Farmers-Centre talksAdvertisement
A day before the agitating Punjab farm unions’ crucial meeting with Union ministers, farmer leaders on Saturday asked the Centre to bring an Ordinance on giving a legal guarantee to minimum support price (MSP) for crops, while a tractor march and dharnas were held in their support in Punjab and Haryana.
Union ministers Arjun Munda, Piyush Goyal and Nityanand Rai and Punjab farmer leaders will meet in Chandigarh on Sunday for the fourth round of their talks. Punjab Chief Minister and AAP leader Bhagwant Mann is also likely to be in attendance at this meeting.
The two sides met earlier on February 8, 12 and 15, but those talks remained inconclusive.

On the fifth day of their “Delhi Chalo” march — called by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (Non-Political) and the Kisan Mazdoor Morcha – on Saturday, the protesting farmers stayed put at the Shambhu and Khanauri points of the Punjab-Haryana border.Advertisement
Farmer leader Sarwan Singh Pandher demanded that the Centre should bring an Ordinance on giving a legal guarantee to MSP, which along with debt waiver are among the farmers’ key demands.
Stating that the Centre has a right to take “political” decisions, Pandher said, “If the government wants resolution of farmers’ protest, then it should bring an Ordinance… then discussion can proceed further… It (Centre) can bring the Ordinance overnight, if it wants so.”
Pandher said the entire country was looking to the PM for addressing the farmers’ demands. He expressed hope that the farmers will get “good news” after the Sunday’s meeting, saying now the “ball is in the government’s court”.
Farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal, who is also leading the protests, echoed Pandher’s remarks, saying the government should bring an Ordinance on MSP for “giving something to people of the country”.
Kamal Nath set to leave CongAdvertisement
The Congress is bracing itself for yet another high-profile exit. This time, senior party leader Kamal Nath is poised to jump ship, who was associated with the Congress, particularly the Gandhis for over five decades.
On Saturday, Nath and his son and Lok Sabha MP Nakul arrived in Delhi amid strong buzz of their exit, with Nakul dropping “Congress” from his social media accounts.
Asked whether he was joining the BJP, Nath told reporters, “Why are you all getting excited. If there is something like that I will inform you first.”

Nath’s exit would come as another reminder of the party losing several of its key faces. Nath would be the tenth former CM of the Congress to leave the party in the last 10 years, joining the ranks of Ashok Chavan – who switched to the BJP earlier this week – Mukul Sangma (Meghalaya), Amarinder Singh (Punjab), Ghulam Nabi Azad (Jammu and Kashmir), Vijay Bahuguna (Uttarakhand), late Ajit Jogi (Chhattisgarh), S M Krishna (Karnataka), Narayan Rane (Maharashtra) and Giridhar Gamang (Odisha) who returned to the party recently.
Disgruntled Jharkhand Cong MLAs
Amid strong resentment brewing among some Congress legislators in Jharkhand over the induction of four party MLAs in the Cabinet of Chief Minister Champai Soren, eight of the 12 disgruntled MLAs reached Delhi on Saturday evening.
“We have reached Delhi.

“The JMM has already taken the CM and the Speaker’s posts. They have six ministerial berths and we want the remaining one. We are not compromising on that,” Jaimangal said.

"As farmers direct heat at the Centre, AAP’s Punjab govt catches a break","A week, they say, is a long time in politics. The beleaguered Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) might agree.
Till February 10, the Bhagwant Mann-led AAP government was in the news for all the wrong reasons – protests by teachers, by a union of the “unemployed” seeking jobs, as well as by farmers. The arrest of a popular YouTuber last month on an extortion charge, followed by other allegations, and the crackdown on his supporters, had further earned the Mann government public ire.
In the midst of all this, the launch of the Punjab government’s much-vaunted ‘AAP di sarkar, aap de dwar (Your government at your doorstep)’ scheme, to bring selected government services to the masses, sank almost without notice.Advertisement

On February 6, the same day as the launch of the scheme, the BKU Ugrahan started day-night dharnas outside district administration offices across the state over various demands. Its state chief Joginder Singh Ugrahan announced a series of conferences and said they would march to the CM house in Chandigarh on February 24.
But then began the farmer march towards Delhi on February 13 demanding legalisation of MSP, and the unexpectedly harsh crackdown by the BJP-led Haryana government on them. As the Haryana Police, backed by Central forces, pushed farmers back with multiple levels of barricades, drones dropping teargas shells, lathicharge and rubber pellets, the narrative changed. So did the object of the blame.

Soon, the BKU Ugrahan announced that given what was happening on the Punjab-Haryana borders at Shambhu and Khanauri, it would not hold its planned conferences and was postponing its march to the CM House indefinitely. “Instead, we will be staging dharnas outside houses of BJP leaders, including BJP state president Sunil Jakhar, Amarinder Singh and Kewal Dhillon, in support of the protesting farmers,” the BKU Ugrahan said.
Incidentally, all the BJP leaders who are set to face BKU Ugrahan protests now were formerly in the Congress, and had actively supported the 2020-21 farmer agitation against the three contentious farm laws.Advertisement
With the Samyukta Kisan Morcha’s national coordination body also now behind the farmers sitting on the borders with Haryana, the heat is off the AAP government.
And there is much that the Mann government has to answer for, according to farm leaders, including “the lack of an agriculture policy”, a year after the CM fixed its launch date as March 2023.

Farmers have also been demanding pending compensation for crops damaged due to floods in July-August 2023, excessive and untimely rainfall in March-April 2022, and the Muktsar water-logging in July 2022.
Separately, sugarcane farmers have been protesting against the AAP government over not paying its share of the state agreed price (or SAP), even as dues remain pending with mills. The promised compensation to families of farmers confirmed to have died of suicide, and action over the supply of spurious seeds are also yet to happen.Advertisement
Besides, farmers have been demanding quashing of FIRs lodged by the Punjab Police against them, and the heavy environment compensation fines imposed on them, for stubble burning.
The protests by teacher unions over jobs not being provided despite many clearing the eligibility test have been as constant.
On November 1, 2023, the AAP sought to cool matters by planning a “debate”, dubbed ‘Main Punjab Bolda Haan’ and inviting representatives of political parties. But even as no Opposition leader turned up, calling the debate a stunt, the government cracked down on farmer leaders, unemployed and teacher union leaders who wanted to raise questions at the session.

As the Mann government now speaks up for the farmers held back at the Haryana borders, to stop them from reaching Delhi, and the CM himself emerges as a mediator, what is also forgotten is how the AAP has itself treated protesters a number of times.Advertisement
Apart from the November 2023 incident, in August last year, when the same Kisan Mazdoor Morcha (KMM) and SKM (Non-Political) that are behind the current protest had announced a march towards the Governor House, the Punjab government had rounded up their leaders to stop them from coming to Chandigarh.
“Now the Punjab government is extending all support to the farmers as they are protesting against the Centre. At the same time, they are completely silent on their own unfulfilled promises,” says Raman Kumar, president of the Unemployed Joint Front of Punjab.
AAP chief spokesperson Malwinder Singh Kang denied that the Mann government was hoping to “divert attention” from its shortcomings. “In the past two years, CM Mann has interacted with farmer union leaders the most to get to know their demands. I don’t think any other CM has had so many interactions with farmer leaders.”
Listing measures taken by the government, Kang told The Indian Express: “Our state government is doing the best with whatever resources we have. Canal water reach for irrigation has been increased from 30% to 45% of the area in the last two years and we are committed to maximising it… In the present case, all the demands of the protesting farmers are concerning the Centre and what PM Modi himself agreed to two years ago. The CM is also playing a key role as a mediator.”",politics
"In Kamal Nath, BJP sees a chance to strike deep at Congress heart, and pocket","The likely entry of former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister, ex-Union minister and long-time Congress leader Kamal Nath into the BJP begs the question — what does the BJP, which defeated the Congress comprehensively in the recent state Assembly polls, gain from his anticipated entry?
As per a central leader of the party, the BJP had two important considerations. “One, that his entry into the Congress, close on the heels of former Maharashtra CM Ashok Chavan’s, will send the message that the Congress has collapsed so badly that it cannot even retain its ex-chief ministers. It will also underscore the BJP as the biggest political force of the country, far ahead of its rival,” said the leaders.
Two BJP insiders said the Congress, already cash-strapped after its shrinking political footprint, will also feel the loss of Kamal Nath’s fund-raising abilities.Advertisement

BJP leaders expect the announcement of Kamal Nath’s entry to come soon after the ongoing BJP National Council meeting.
Referring specifically to Madhya Pradesh, a BJP state leader said Kamal Nath is expected to cross over with loyalists from his turf Chhindwara, as well as those belonging to Jabalpur and a few other places. That will reinforce the impression of a Congress in implosion in another state where it has been strong, particularly coming after the departure of leaders close to Jyotiraditya Scindia to the BJP in the Chambal division.
A state BJP insider pointed out that in MP, the Congress has always been a combination of three or four lobbies. Now the legacy of the late Arjun Singh has faded, Digvijaya Singh has got “discredited among common Hindus” due to his Hindutva remarks, while Scindia is already in the BJP, the leader said, adding that if Kamal Nath too leaves now, the Congress will have no regional anchor left in MP – further opening up the field for the BJP.

A senior MP BJP functionary on condition of anonymity said Kamal Nath was too much of an old warhorse to not look out for his own political survival. “The only way he can sustain his political legacy after the recent election drubbing, at about 80 years of age, is to sail with the political current. In the BJP, Kamal Nath has a better chance of ensuring that his son or daughter-in-law continues his legacy,” the leader said.Advertisement

Plus, as many BJP leaders point out, Kamal Nath, whose rise in the Congress happened courtesy his friendship with Sanjay Gandhi, does not really carry any ideological baggage. In fact, he leads among the Congress leaders trying soft Hindutva in a bid to take on the BJP.
During the Assembly elections, in an interview to The Indian Express, Kamal Nath had suggested that the Congress also deserved credit for the Ram Temple, which was then being built in Ayodhya. It was under Rajiv Gandhi as Prime Minister that the locks of Babri Masjid were opened, and he had also allowed the VHP to do shilanyas of the temple, Kamal Nath had said, adding that the BJP could not claim sole credit.",politics
"Rahul Gandhi visits Kashi Vishwanath, maintains silence on Gyanvapi","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, during his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Uttar Pradesh on Saturday, visited Varanasi, the Parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Rahul began the day with “darshan” at Kashi Vishwanath Temple. Wearing a “rudraksha mala” around his neck, Rahul addressed a gathering at Godowlia crossing, saying that he has come with his “head bowed before Ganga ji.”
Rahul said, “Main yahan aaya mandir mein maine matha teka. Ganga ji ko pranam karne ayah hoon main. Ganga ji ke samne, main yahan ahankar se nahi aaya hoon. Main sar jhukake, Ganga ji ke samne aaya hoon,” (I came here and offered prayers at the temple. I have not come before Ganga ji with arrogance. I have come with my head bowed.)
Rahul, however, did not speak on the Gyanvyapi row.Advertisement

Recently, a Varanasi court allowed puja in the southern cellar of the Gyanvapi mosque complex adjacent to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple. The Congress and most of the parties of the Opposition INDIA alliance barring the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) maintained a cautious silence.
Rahul told the gathering that “true patriotism” is “uniting the country.”
“Desh ko ek saath karna, ek jut karna, jodna hi desh ki bhakti hai”. (To unite the country and bring it together is true patriotism), he said. Rahul added that the country would become strong only when people would work together.
Rahul said that many people come to meet him in the Yatra and thus when his team asked him what to do, Rahul said, “Jo bhi aaye use lagna chahiye.. Apne ghar aaya hoon, apne bhai se milne aaya hoon,” (Whoever comes to meet me should feel that he has come to his own house… He has come to meet his brother).Advertisement
Rahul asked one of the youths in the crowd, whose name is also Rahul, to come over to his jeep and asked him about the amount spent by his father on his studies and whether he has got a job. The youth informed him that he hailed from Bihar and had come to apply for a job in police in Uttar Pradesh but feared that the large number of applications mean it might be tough for him.
Apna Dal (K) leader and SP MLA Pallavi Patel and her party leaders carrying Apna Dal flag, also joined the Yatra.
In Varanasi, Rahul also undertook a 12-km road show.

Later in the day, Congress leaders said that in a reversal of an earlier decision, the second stretch of the Yatra would cover western Uttar Pradesh as well. In West UP, the Yatra would resume from Moradabad and cover Amroha, Sambhal, Aligarh, Hathras and Agra before entering Rajasthan.
Asked about possibility of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra contesting from Raebareli, Congress state president Ajay Rai said that Gandhi family has a “long association with Raebareli” and added that Priyanka can decide to contest from anywhere she wants.Advertisement
Sources said that SP chief Akhilesh Yadav is likely to join Rahul Gandhi’s Yatra in Raebareli on February 20.
Meanwhile, the Congress alleged that permission for its cameras to accompany Rahul during his visit to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple was cancelled at the last moment and said this was “pettiness” on the part of the Varanasi district administration.
In an apparent swipe at PM Modi, the party alleged that by doing this, the “district administration once again proved that it is nothing more than an employee of the ‘Camerajivi’ sitting in Delhi”.
UP Congress president Ajay Rai alleged that no cameras were allowed with Rahul when he went to Kashi Vishwanath Temple to offer prayers.Advertisement
“All BJP leaders, when they come to offer prayers at Kashi Vishwanath temple, are allowed to enter with cameras. No cameras were allowed with Rahul Gandhi and till now no photos have been released by the administration,” he told reporters.
Rahul also continued his attack on sections of the media and said that they would only show actors dancing and would show PM Modi 24 hours but not the issues faced by labourers or farmers. Taking selected names, he suggested that they were owned by “Adani ji, Ambani ji”.
As Rahul also mentioned the Press Trust of India (PTI), the agency reacted to the statement later in the day and posted on X, “Shocked to hear Rahul Gandhi say PTI is owned by Adani and Ambani. PTI is an independent, not-for-profit company. It has been jointly owned since Independence by a group of newspaper companies that derive no income from PTI’s revenue.”
Rahul alleged that certain media houses would not show the issues of farmers or labourers or poor as their owners have asked them not to show it. “Yeh kisan ke baare mein, majdoor ke bare mein garib ke bare mein kabhi nahi dikhane wale..Inke malik kehte hai…Hindustan ke garibon ke bare mein media mein nahi dikhana” (They would never show the farmers, labourers, poor.. their owners have told them not to do so).

"Decode Politics: Behind Kejriwal’s repeated trust vote moves, targeting BJP, House muscle-flexing","Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday won the confidence motion that was tabled by him in the AAP-dominated Delhi Assembly, with 54 AAP MLAs who were present in the House voting in support of it.
The move can be seen as a show of strength on Kejriwal’s part amidst his allegations that the BJP was trying to poach the AAP legislators and topple his government.
Tabling the motion on Friday, Kejriwal termed it a “parliamentary manoeuvre”, even as he alleged that seven MLAs from his party were offered Rs 25 crore each to switch to the BJP. The rationale behind the motion, he argued, was “to demonstrate that once again, the BJP’s ‘Operation Lotus’ has faltered in Delhi”.Advertisement
“None of our MLAs defected, and all remain steadfastly aligned with us,” the AAP supremo said.
House proceedings and implications
In the 70-member Delhi Assembly, the AAP has 62 MLAs.
The 54 AAP MLAs present in the House on Saturday voted for Kejriwal’s trust vote. Seven BJP MLAs in the House were suspended on Friday for allegedly creating ruckus. The only BJP MLA in the House during the discussion on the trust vote was Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, the Leader of Opposition, with his voice being the only dissenting one.
The discussion on the confidence motion saw Kejriwal hit out at the BJP for allegedly seeking to “paralyse the city’s administration by arm-twisting bureaucrats into submission”, seeking to “buy AAP MLAs for Rs 25 crore each” and arrest him to topple the AAP government.
Kejriwal, whose party is part of the Opposition INDIA bloc and is engaged in seat-sharing talks with the Congress, also signalled the agenda for the AAP’s campaign against the BJP, which rules the Centre, in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.Advertisement
At present, the AAP does not have a single MP from Delhi.
During his address, the CM accused the BJP of “peddling a rumour” that the Delhi Assembly “would be done away with” if the BJP came back to power once again. He asked his party MLAs “to go to citizens” regarding this alleged conspiracy and tell them that “the BJP was seeking to render the power of their franchise useless by dissolving the Delhi Assembly”.
What happens now?
The motion was not only a show of legislative strength within the House, but also to send out a political signal amidst the possibility of Kejriwal’s arrest by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the liquor policy case. Kejriwal has so far skipped five summons issued by the ED. His main ground for skipping the ED ‘s summonses has been his question whether he was being summoned as an accused or a witness.The ED has also filed in a Delhi court a case against Kejriwal over his non-compliance with the summons for which the CM appeared before the court on Saturday via video conferencing, expressing regret that he could not appear in person because of the ongoing Assembly session. The court has adjourned the matter to March 16.
The ED has issued its sixth summons to Kejriwal earlier this week, asking him to appear on February 19. All eyes will now be on whether he appears before the ED next week.
Past confidence motionsAdvertisement
This is the third trust vote proceedings that unfolded in the Delhi Assembly during the current tenure of the Kejriwal
government that started its third term in February 2020.
On all three occasions, the trigger, as per Kejriwal, has been an alleged attempt by the BJP to wean away the AAP legislators under “Operation Lotus”. The first such show of strength took place in August 2022 when Kejriwal proposed and won a confidence vote in the floor of the House after accusing the BJP of allegedly offering Rs 20 crore each to the AAP MLAs to break ranks and join the BJP.
The next one was in March 2023, days after the arrest of former deputy CM Manish Sisodia in the liquor policy case by the CBI. Kejriwal had then accused the BJP of getting central agencies such as the CBI and the ED “to call and threaten AAP MLAs” with arrest if they did not break away and join the BJP.
BJP’s response
On each such occasion, the BJP has contended that the vote of confidence in a House already dominated by the AAP “is an exercise in futility, a waste of the legislature’s time and a ploy by the AAP chief to divert attention from allegations of corruption”.Advertisement
Bidhuri has alleged that the Delhi CM’s latest motion of confidence was a bid to avoid appearing at a city court in relation to the ED case. The BJP has also filed a formal complaint with the Delhi Police regarding the AAP’s poaching charges and has argued that Kejriwal was not cooperating with police investigation regarding his own allegations.",politics
"On Kamal Nath, Congress puts up brave face, but state unit has some anxieties","Even as senior Congress leaders insisted there was no possibility of former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath leaving the party for the BJP, some in the party’s state unit admitted things had gone downhill ever since the disastrous showing in the Assembly polls and his ouster as state president.
“Kamal Nath has not dismissed any of the rumours. He has not said even once that he would take strict action against those spreading rumours. This has caused many in the party anxiety…this is a ploy by the BJP to spoil Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra which will enter Madhya Pradesh soon,” said one senior party leader.
Another leader weighed in that the party high command had botched his exit as the state chief. Nath was projected as the CM face and enjoyed almost full autonomy in decision making – from ticket distribution to the campaign strategy – but the party’s final tally suggested the gamble had not paid off.Advertisement

Said another senior leader, “He was not taken into confidence over the appointment of Jitu Patwari (as his replacement as MP unit chief). He was subsequently sidelined by the Congress party and disappeared from posters. He was miffed and did not turn up for Patwari’s nomination, meeting him only weeks later.”
Leaders also said that Nath was frustrated with the party not taking immediate action against spokesperson Alok Sharma, who alleged in an interview that the Congress veteran may have had an understanding with the BJP and that the “arrogance of one person spoiled the entire election atmosphere”.
On Saturday, Nath and his son Nakul arrived in Delhi after abruptly cancelling his programme in Chhindwara, setting off political circles abuzz with rumours of the father and son joining the BJP.
Nath was touring his constituency in Chhindwara when he cancelled his plans and left for Delhi. Adding more fuel to the speculation was when Nakul dropped Congress from his bio on his social media accounts. A state BJP spokesperson, Narendra Saluja, also tweeted a picture of the father-son duo with the caption ‘Jai Shri Ram’.Advertisement
This development comes a day after state BJP President V D Sharma said doors were open for Nath to join the party if he had pain in his heart since his party insulted Lord Ram.
After landing in Delhi, Nath told reporters: “It is not about denying, you are saying this, you people are getting excited. I am not getting excited, this side or that side, but if there is any such thing, I would inform you first.”
His confidant Sajjan Singh Verma addressed a press conference in Indore where he spoke about removing the Congress symbol from his own social media account. “If the person with whom I did politics for 40 years – if from his profile it is removed, then even from my profile it should be removed. Kamal Nath has not taken any decision yet. Maan, samaan aur swabhimaan. People do politics because of that. They take a different path. I am not saying Kamal Nath had experienced something similar. Wherever Kamal Nath goes, Sajjan Verma will follow.”
On Friday, former Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh had said that he spoke to Nath over the phone. “If someone who joined his political career with the Nehru-Gandhi family. He stood with them… can you expect such a person to leave the party. You should not have such expectations,” Singh said.Advertisement
Ragogarh MLA and son of Digvijaya Singh, Jaivardhan Singh told The Indian Express, “My father spoke to him yesterday. We are hopeful that someone of his stature decides to stay. Kamal Nath hasn’t said anything. We still have hopes, we are waiting and watching.”
On Saturday, Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Jitu Patwari too dismissed the rumours: “Can you imagine Indira’s third son leaving the Congress? Even in your dreams, can such a thought occur that Kamal Nath, under whose guidance we fought the Assembly elections just two months ago, would leave the party? When (Jyotiraditya) Scindia was leaving the party, it was people like us who were taking blows from the police to ensure that Kamal Nath would remain chief minister. Can he leave us? These are rumours. For the Rajya Sabha nominations, Ashok Singh’s name was presented by Kamal Nath. We also took his name after that. This news is false.”
Nath, while addressing a gathering in Chhindwara earlier in the day, said that together, they will “start a new journey of development”. “I have given my youth for Chhindwara. In the end, I want to say, till my last breath we will be together and start a new journey of development,” he said.
Nakul, while speaking at the public function, urged voters to vote for him, promising he would double the speed of development in Chhindwara. But he did not talk about the Congress party in his speech.Advertisement
Nath is a nine-time MLA from Chhindwara which has remained firmly in his family’s grasp since 1980. Nakul became the Chhindwara MP in 2019, the sole seat the Congress managed to retain while it was swept away in the remaining 28 seats. However, he won by a margin of 37,536 votes, which surprised Congress leaders in the state who expected a better showing.",politics
"Gandhi loyalist Kamal Nath, his MP-son likely to leave Congress for BJP","In what will be another setback to the Congress on the eve of the Lok Sabha elections, party veteran leader Kamal Nath and his son and Lok Sabha MP Nakul are likely to quit the party and join the BJP, sources said.
A former Chief Minister and nine-time MP, Kamal Nath, who has worked with three generations of the Gandhis, is set to end his over 50-year association with the Congress at a time when the party is bracing for one of its toughest electoral battles till date.
Nath, 77, will be the tenth former CM of the Congress to leave the party in the last 10 years, joining the ranks of Maharashtra’s Ashok Chavan – who switched to the BJP earlier this week – Mukul Sangma (Meghalaya), Amarinder Singh (Punjab), Ghulam Nabi Azad (Jammu and Kashmir), Vijay Bahuguna (Uttarakhand), late Ajit Jogi (Chhattisgarh), S M Krishna (Karnataka), Narayan Rane (Maharashtra) and Giridhar Gamang (Odisha) who returned to the party recently.Advertisement

Amid speculation of his switch to the BJP, Nath reached Delhi from Chhindwara Saturday afternoon. Asked whether he was joining the BJP, he told reporters, “Why are you all getting excited. If there is something like that I will inform you first.”
On whether he was denying it, Nath said, “Inkaar ki baat nahin hai (this is not about denying it). This (that he was switching sides) you are saying. You are getting excited. I am not excited, iss taraf ya uss taraf (either way).”
His son Nakul’s move to drop “Congress” from his social media accounts, however, fuelled the speculation.
Madhya Pradesh BJP spokesperson Narendra Saluja also tweeted a picture of the father-son duo with the caption ‘Jai Shri Ram’.Advertisement
Four-time Chhindwara MLA and former state minister Deepak Saxena told The Indian Express that “talks were underway” on Kamal Nath joining the BJP and that this was because of lack of development in Chhindwara.
“All our MLAs are from Congress and yet the funds were not released to Chhindwara. For the sake of Chhindwara’s development, this move has happened. Kamal Nath was constantly attacked and blamed for the Assembly (election) loss. In two-three days, you will see the results of these talks,” Saxena, a long-time ally of Nath, said.

Nath recently hosted a closed-door meeting with senior Chhindwara leaders where he discussed future election strategies. Chhindwara Congress district president Vishwanath Okte told The Indian Express, “Kamal Nath discussed strategies for Lok Sabha. The positions that had to be handed out and event planning. He did not discuss anything about joining the BJP.”
The state BJP unit is meanwhile in a huddle. “Kamal Nath is going to join the BJP for sure. We have been in talks with him ever since he was snubbed over Jitu Patwari. He knew that Chhindwara was going to be a BJP seat in the upcoming election and took the smart step,” a senior BJP leader said.Advertisement
Nath’s confidant Sajjan Singh Verma addressed a press conference in Indore where he spoke about removing the Congress symbol from his own social media account. “If the person with whom I did politics for 40 years – if from his profile it is removed, then even from my profile it should be removed. Kamal Nath has not taken any decision yet. Maan, samman aur swabhimaan. People do politics because of that. They take a different path. I am not saying Kamal Nath had experienced something similar. Wherever Kamal Nath goes, Sajjan Verma will follow.”

Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Jitu Patwari dismissed the “rumours”: “Can you imagine Indira’s third son leaving the Congress? Even in your dreams, can such a thought occur that Kamal Nath, under whose guidance we fought the Assembly elections just two months ago, would leave the party?”
Senior leaders in the state Congress, however, expressed some anxiety. Said one party leader, “Kamal Nath has not dismissed any of the rumours. He has not said even once that he would take strict action against those spreading rumours.”
Nath’s exit would be a huge blow for the Gandhi family given his close personal ties, going back to the days of Indira Gandhi. Nath, a Doon School mate of Sanjay Gandhi, joined the Youth Congress in the 1970s and soon became a key member of Sanjay’s inner circle with the likes of Jagmohan, V C Shukla, Bansi Lal, Om Mehta, Jagdish Tytler and later Akbar Dumpy Ahmad – a coterie that is often blamed for all that went wrong during and after the Emergency.Advertisement
Nath, who hails from Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, was rewarded for his friendship with Sanjay with the Chhindwara seat in Madhya Pradesh in the 1980 Lok Sabha polls. Chhindwara and Nagaur in Rajasthan were the only two seats the Congress had won in the 1977 elections post Emergency when the party was wiped out in the Hindi heartland. Since then, Nath won nine Lok Sabha elections from Chhindwara, losing only once.He was one of Sanjay’s pointsmen who used to drum up political support for the Emergency. It is said that it was he who met Shiv Sena’s Bal Thackeray on Sanjay’s behalf and enlisted his support for the Emergency.
“Sanjay Gandhi used Nath, then his ace lieutenant, to start ‘back channel’ talks with Bal Thackeray. Founder of the Shiv Sena and known as the strongman of Maharashtra, Thackeray had been a strong critic of the Congress. After the Emergency in 1975, Sanjay spoke to him on the phone and sent Nath to Mumbai to meet him… Thackeray agreed to support the Emergency. ‘It’s good for the country,’ he told Nath. Then he added, ‘Once the law and order situation improves, the Emergency can be lifted’,” Neerja Chowdhury, Contributing Editor, The Indian Express, has written in her book, ‘How Prime Ministers Decide’.
Nath had been a minister in the P V Narasimha Rao government and later in the UPA I and II governments led by Manmohan Singh. He was one of Rao’s interlocutors who held parleys with L K Advani in the months before the demolition of the Babri Masjid.
Despite being in the Congress for decades, Nath was never really active in Madhya Pradesh politics. He was always a Delhi leader, known for his links with the corporates. He became active in MP politics only in 2018 when he was appointed the state Congress chief. Later that year, Rahul Gandhi anointed him as the CM after the Congress won the Assembly elections, much to the displeasure of the younger party leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, who switched to the BJP in March 2020 after toppling the Nath government.Advertisement
The exit of Nath, who was never a regional satrap with deep organisational support, is hence going to be more a psychological blow to the Congress, coming as it does right ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, rather than a massive organisational setback. The Congress is already battling a perception gaining ground that the Opposition INDIA bloc is adrift and the Congress is facing desertions.",politics
"Nadda, Rajnath lead BJP chorus: Modi will be back for third term","As the BJP national council adopted a resolution titled ‘Viksit Bharat – Modi ki Guarantee’ and hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for having “effectively implemented the concept of Ram Rajya in the last 10 years”, party president J P Nadda, Defence Minister and senior leader Rajnath Singh said Saturday that Modi would return to power for a third straight term with a roadmap for expanding the government’s welfare and development programmes that have “been reaching every home”.
Earlier in the day, setting clear targets for the BJP in the countdown to the elections, Modi said that party workers should see a target of 370 Lok Sabha seats as their tribute to Jana Sangh founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee, and not just as a number.
Mookerjee had campaigned against Article 370, demanding complete integration of Jammu and Kashmir with India. In August 2019, the Modi government ensured the abrogation of Article 370, ending the special status of J&K.Advertisement
Addressing BJP office-bearers at the start of the two-day meeting of the party national council in New Delhi, Modi said each party worker should focus on his or her polling booth now, take the welfare measures and development work of the BJP government to the voters, and try to ensure that he or she gets 370 more votes than the last time for the party in his or her booth.
Briefing the press on the Prime Minister’s address to the office-bearers, BJP general secretary Vinod Tawde said Modi announced the “names” of Lok Sabha candidates of the party: “The lotus”. The message: party office-bearers and workers should look at just the party symbol, nothing else.

Later, addressing party delegates, BJP president Nadda said the party was the only one that had maintained the same ideological stand from 1951 to the present day.
He said the party saw victory the last time and will see victory in the future too.Advertisement
Despite being very busy, Modi still gives priority to the party and constantly thinks how he can take the party to greater heights, Nadda said.
He praised party workers for making the party powerful at the grassroots.
He said that Jana Sangh and BJP saw the Emergency, struggles, electoral defeats, etc, but the last 10 years were a period of “success” and “happiness”.

“In 2009, the BJP got 18 per cent votes, and this increased to 31 per cent votes in 2014 and 37 per cent votes in 2019 under Modi ji,” Nadda said.Advertisement
“We are today the world’s largest political party. There was a time when we would have governments in about five states. The NDA has governments in 17 states and BJP has governments in 12 states. Since 2019, we won 16 of the 26 Assembly elections,” he said.
He also pointed to the rise of the party in West Bengal, and said “the next innings will be ours”.
He referred to other instances of the BJP’s successes, particularly in the North-East. He said the vote share of the BJP even in Telangana had doubled from 7 per cent to 14 per cent in the recent Assembly elections, and that the party would leave no stone unturned to become a major force in the state.
Nadda listed details of various welfare schemes of the Modi government. He said women’s reservation was held up for political reasons for three decades but was passed in three days under the leadership of Modi – this had the delegates chanting “Modi, Modi”.Advertisement
Nadda recalled that the BJP and Jana Sangh used to have a slogan that it would not accept two flags, two Constitutions and two PMs in one country; that Modi also hoisted the Tricolour in Srinagar with Murli Manohar Joshi, and that the Modi government finally revoked Article 370.
On the issue of Ayodhya, Nadda said the party had said “Mandir wahin banaayenge”, and Modi finally consecrated the idol in the temple on January 22. Mocking the Opposition for saying for years that the BJP had given no date for the Ram temple at Ayodhya, Nadda said that the date did come but such was the “karma” of Opposition leaders that they did not attend it. He then joined the delegates in chanting Jai Shri Ram.
He commended L K Advani for his contribution as a BJP leader and former minister, and acknowledged the contribution of Chaudhary Charan Singh, Karpoori Thakur, P V Narasimha Rao and M S Swaminathan, the other recipients of the Bharat Ratna this year.
Nadda said that under Modi, India had become the fifth largest economy of the world. The PM, he said, would return to power for a third term, and India would rise to be the third largest economy of the world (in GDP terms).",politics
Battle lines being drawn for Ajit Pawar wife vs Supriya Sule in Baramati: Who is Sunetra Pawar?,"With the Lok Sabha polls just round the corner, the raging battle between Pawars has reached their home turf – Baramati in Maharashtra’s Pune district.
The Baramati Lok Sabha seat is currently represented by Supriya Sule, the daughter of NCP founder Sharad Pawar. Recently, a publicity campaign has been launched in the constituency, with Sunetra Pawar, the wife of rebel NCP faction leader and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, making the rounds to meet local party leaders and cadre.
A vehicle bearing an audio visual public address system and photographs of Sunetra and Ajit has also been moving around, raising speculation about Sunetra being pitted against Sule, who is her sister-in-law, in the coming polls.Advertisement
State NCP chief Sunil Tatkare also indicated that Sunetra might be fielded. “There is a demand and wish of party workers from Baramati to get Sunetra Pawar elected to the Lok Sabha. She has been doing social work in the constituency for long and has been helping her husband handle the responsibility of the area. However, the final decision has to be taken,” he said.

The Baramati seat has been a Pawar family bastion, with Sharad Pawar himself winning the seat six times. Ajit also won the seat in 1991. As Ajit gears up for the Lok Sabha polls for the first time after splitting the party last July, this seat is going to be critical for him.
The BJP has also identified Baramati as one of the 16 “difficult” seats in Maharashtra. This is the seat the ruling Shinde Sena-BJP- Ajit NCP coalition would hope to wrest from the Pawar NCP.
Behind-the scenes role
Sunetra, 60, was born into a political family from the Dharashiv district. She is the sister of former state minister and Lok Sabha MP Padamsinh Patil, who is a close confidant of Sharad Pawar. Patil had also played a significant role in establishing the NCP along with Pawar in 1999. Patil’s son Ranajagjitsinha Patil is currently BJP MLA from Tuljapur in Dharashiv district.Advertisement
Sunetra has never contested an election earlier, but she has remained active in campaigning for her husband in the Baramati Assembly seat in the state polls.

Sunetra has served as the chairperson of the Baramati Hi-Tech Textile Park Ltd, a multimodal garment manufacturer’s park under the central government, since 2006. She is also a board member of the Vidya Pratishthan Trust founded by Sharad Pawar.
The Ajit Pawar led NCP is now showcasing her social work before the voters in Baramati. On Friday, addressing his party workers in Baramati, Ajit said he would declare a suitable candidate for the Baramati constituency.Advertisement
“I am going to put up a candidate in Baramati because we want to be part of the ruling alliance to enable development work in the constituency. It is clear that Narendra Modi will become the Prime Minister for the third time from the way he has got the Ram Mandir constructed and carried out development work across the country,” he said, adding that the party cadre “should reach out to voters and tell them that my candidate will do more work than the MP ( Sule)”.
A party leader said Sunetra was the force behind getting her elder son Parth Pawar to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Maval in 2019. Parth’s candidature had been an issue between Pawar and Ajit, leading to friction between the uncle and nephew.
The decision to field Parth came at the cost of Pawar withdrawing from the race as the latter was said to be keen that not more than two members of his family should contest the elections. Parth lost the seat with a margin of over two lakh votes.
Sunetra, an NCP leader said, had also played a role in the surprise swearing-in of Ajit as the Deputy CM in November 2019, alongside Devendra Fadnavis as CM. He resigned within days, with Pawar then managing to stop a split in the party.Advertisement
The situation, however, flared up again last July when Ajit, along with many party leaders, joined the ruling alliance of the BJP and the Shiv Sena led by CM Eknath Shinde.
While Ajit is referred to as “Dada (brother)” by his followers, Sunetra is called “Vahini (sister-in-law)”.",politics
Punjab CM in new role: How Mann has risen  as unlikely mediator in Centre-farmers talksPremium Story,"In the standoff between agitating farmer organisations and the Central government, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann, has emerged as an unlikely mediator.
The farmer unions brought in CM Mann as a mediator in their talks with the BJP-ruled Centre over their various demands that include a legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP) for crops and farm debt waiver.

As a senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader, CM Mann is seen by farm protesters as being in confrontation with the Centre just like them, especially given that he has been taking on the Narendra Modi government and Punjab Governor Banwarilal Purohit over the Centre’s alleged withholding Rs 8,000 crore of funds from the state. But he is now also being seen as a moderating force.Advertisement
On Thursday, during the third round of the meeting between the farmer leaders and Union ministers, Mann stood by the farmers, while also nudging them to the negotiating table by asking them to believe in the power of dialogue. He also portrayed himself as the custodian of three crore people of the state, who was concerned that they get regular supplies of fuel, milk and other items.

Mann is himself at loggerheads with the Centre, and especially with Union minister Piyush Goyal, who is in charge of the Ministry of Food that has allegedly declined to pay Punjab its share of Rural Development Funds (RDF). The RDF is a statutory fund, levied by the state on the Centre on the grains it procures for national granaries. However, the Mann dispensation has alleged that the Centre has been sitting on Rs 5,500 crore dues to the state. Mann has met Goyal in the past over the issue, which has now landed in the Supreme Court.
Express Opinion | avleen Singh writes: Listen to the farmers
Mann used Thursday’s meeting to raise this issue too, reminding Goyal that with this money, the state could mitigate a lot of farm distress by compensating the farmers for managing their stubble, which has been a cause of concern for both the state and the Centre.

Yet, Mann’s presence at these meetings was not only seen as reassuring by the farmers, but was also beneficial to the Centre. He grasped the offer to become a mediator, asking the farmers to press on with their demands, but also by using the opportunity to put his point across to the Centre.Advertisement
On Thursday, besides raising the issue of the RDFs, Mann also highlighted Haryana turning its border with Punjab into a “replica of the Indo-Pak border” with the installation of barricades, as well as the suspension of internet across three districts that, according to Mann, was harassing students appearing for board exams. He also criticised the lobbing of teargas shells and other ammunition by security forces from the Haryana side at the agitating farmers.
“They (Haryana Police) lob shells, which land up in our territory (Punjab). That is why I asked the Deputy Commissioner (DC) of Patiala (Showkat Ahmed Parray) to write a letter to the Ambala DC. Why should they do that?” the CM told the media on Thursday.
Mann also had a word for caution for the farmers, requesting them to maintain peace. He said he did not want to expose the youth to ammunition, water cannons and tear gas shells. “I am with Punjab and Punjabis. As a custodian of the state, I have to look after all three crore people. We do not want a situation where we face shortage of fuel and other goods. I have to see to the needs of all the people,” he said, hinting at the possibility of the barricades impeding essential supplies in Punjab from other states.",politics
Rise of new JMM face: First-time minister Basant Soren set to lead party in LS polls with brother Hemant in jail,"With Hemant Soren in judicial custody, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) is quickly adjusting to life without the leadership of its former chief minister. After taking over as the new CM on February 2 to lead the state’s Mahagathbandhan alliance, JMM leader Champai Soren won the trust vote on February 5. On Friday, he expanded his Cabinet by inducting eight new ministers including Basant Soren, Hemant’s younger brother and Dumka MLA.
After his swearing-in, first-time minister Basant Soren told reporters: “We don’t shy away from uphill tasks… We will fight the election under Hemant Soren and one political party will be wiped out.” Sources said with Hemant in judicial custody, Basant will be a key JMM face in the party’s campaign for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls, especially in the Santhal Parganas region.
The youngest son of JMM supremo Shibu Soren, Basant Soren, 44, heads the party’s youth wing. His political innings began in Dumka when elder brother Hemant fought from there in the state’s first ever Assembly elections in 2005. Hemant lost, but Basant, who was involved in his campaign, learnt his lessons. He, though, had to wait till the 2016 Rajya Sabha elections for his first brush with electoral politics, when he lost by a whisker to the BJP’s Mahesh Poddar.Advertisement
Basant entered the state Assembly in 2020 by winning a bypoll from Dumka, which Hemant had vacated, having also won from Barhait in the December 2019 Assembly polls. During the Covid-19 second wave, he is said to have visited his constituency frequently and helped with the vaccination efforts. A district administration source later said, “Among tribals, there was a lot of hesitancy about vaccines. To combat this, we conducted camps and Basant Soren helped us make people understand the importance of vaccines. From the MLA funds, he also helped us buy two ambulances that were deployed in a few blocks.”
It was during the tense Madhupur by-election in April 2021, though, when Basant made his mark. The bypoll was necessitated by the death of the JMM’s Haji Hussain Ansari in September 2020 due to Covid-19. The Mahagathbandhan fielded Ansari’s son Hafizul Hassan, who was already a minister. But the campaign was led by Basant, and political observers said it was an exam of his political ability.
Having suffered two bypoll losses in Dumka and Bermo since losing the 2019 Assembly elections, the BJP was desperate to win Madhupur, and deployed heavyweights such as former CMs Babulal Marandi and Raghubar Das, Rajya Sabha MP Deepak Prakash and Godda MP Nishikant Dubey to campaign for their candidate, Ganga Narayan.
After Hassan won the contest, a senior MLA who was part of Basant’s campaign team, said, “He (Basant) spoke in the Santhali language and asked the electorate to fight for what his father, Shibu Soren, had achieved. His Santhali oratory is excellent. Only his elder brother Hemant and party senior Champai Soren speak the language better than him.”Advertisement
Even though Basant has got increasingly drawn into party activities since then — for which he began spending more time in Bokaro and Ranchi — his work as MLA in Dumka has continued, including the sanctioning of various projects. These include a mini secretariat in Dumka — which is currently in progress, and an irrigation barrage over the Nunbil river in Masaliya block — for which several hundred crores has been sanctioned.
The JMM functionaries, while claiming that Basant gets preference over other legislators “as he is the son of Guruji (Shibu Soren)”, said he is yet to fully mature. A few also complained of his short temper. In January 2021, miffed by repeated complaints against block-level officers, Basant said at a public event in Dumka, in Hindi, “It is unfortunate that even after your son is at the helm, you say that the BDO (Block Development Officer) or the CO (Circle Officer) don’t listen to you. It is unfortunate that you are not able to throw shoes and slippers (at them).”
The then CM Hemant, who was present at the event, had defended his brother in public, but insiders said Basant was rebuked behind closed doors, told to cap his speeches in Hindi and keep his temper in check.
Basant came into the BJP’s crosshairs in 2022, when the state opposition party alleged that the Dumka MLA had failed to disclose crucial information in his poll affidavit, and had continued engaging in his private business, using his influence to obtain mining and other business rights. The case, which was referred to the ECI by Governor Ramesh Bais, was eventually rejected by the poll panel.",politics
"As Jayant leads RLD to BJP, west UP waits for clearer signs to follow him","Messages celebrating the Bharat Ratna for Chaudhary Charan Singh flank roads all through Baghpat. Some have been put up by the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), a reincarnation of the party Charan Singh founded; others by the BJP. What it means for Uttar Pradesh’s newest allies, though, is not as clear.
Voters of the RLD, whose base is restricted to this Jat belt in western Uttar Pradesh, are waiting and watching as to how much space Charan Singh’s grandson and the party’s leader, Jayant Chaudhary, gets in the alliance with the domineering BJP.
And, it may all come down to Baghpat, the traditional Lok Sabha seat of “the Chaudhary family”. With the specifics of the RLD-BJP alliance not clear yet, it has not escaped the notice of voters that hoardings have come up at several strategic points in Baghpat declaring: “Lehar badi karari hai, hamara Satya Pal sab par bhari hai. (There is a strong wave, our Satya Pal is stronger than all the others).”Advertisement
The reference is to Satya Pal Singh, the two-time sitting BJP MP from Baghpat, and a local hero, having retired as Mumbai Police Commissioner.
Satya Pal’s two wins have both come against the Chaudhary family – against Jayant in 2019 by 23,000-plus votes; and a more comprehensive win against Jayant’s father Ajit Singh in 2014, relegating him to the third position.
“Our claim is strong because Satya Palji is the sitting MP. He has got development works done here — from highways to Railways. If he gets the Baghpat ticket, he will certainly win with a big margin after the support of the RLD. There will be no division of Jat votes,” says a local BJP leader.
Counters RLD district president Rampal Dhama: “If Satya Pal is a two-time MP, Bade Chaudhary (Ajit Singh) was a six-term MP from Baghpat. Charan Singh was also an MP from here… If not here, where will the RLD contest from?”
Making a case for Jayant, Dhama adds: “We are sure that the RLD will get the Baghpat Lok Sabha seat.”
The uncertaintyAdvertisement
However, while Jayant indicated a change in loyalty from the Samajwadi Party (which is in the INDIA bloc) to the NDA within hours of the Bharat Ratna announcement, he is still waiting for that photo-op with BJP big leaders sealing the deal. Rumours of the RLD being promised two seats have not been confirmed by either side, neither is it clear if these would be Baghpat and Bijnor.
The SP had promised the RLD seven Lok Sabha seats, before Jayant ended that tie-up.
The RLD ranks are clearly anxious. A leader says the party was strong without the BJP as well. “A change happened here in social alignment after the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, with the gap between the Muslims and Jats increasing. That was a big reason behind our losses in 2014. But both are together again,” the leader says, pointing out that the party’s vote share had risen in 2019, when it contested the Lok Sabha polls in alliance with the SP and BSP.
The Baghpat constituency has nearly 16 lakh voters, with Jats the largest chunk at 4.5 lakh of the population, followed by Muslims (3.5 lakh), Gujjars (1.5 lakh) and Brahmins (1.5 lakh). Upper castes, OBCs and Dalits form the rest of the numbers.Advertisement

Other Lok Sabha seats in the region – Muzaffarnagar, Kairana, Meerut, Bijnore, Ghaziabad, Nagina, Bulandshahr, Mathura, Aligarh, Hathras, Agra and Moradabad – are almost similar in the dominance of Jats and Muslims.
This is why the RLD’s move could hurt the INDIA coalition more, splitting the Jat-Muslim consolidation, than help the BJP, which has been getting the support of Gujjars as well as other background groups, apart from upper castes.
In the 2022 Assembly polls, when the RLD-SP had an alliance, for example, of the five Assembly segments in the Baghpat Lok Sabha seat – Chhaprauli, Baraut, Baghpat, Siwalkhas and Modi Nagar – the RLD had won only Chhaprauli and Siwalkhas, with the BJP winning the other three.

In fact, in only three Lok Sabha elections, 2009, 2004 and 1999, has the RLD won any seat. Currently, the party’s sole member in Parliament is Jayant, who was elected to the Rajya Sabha in May 2023 as a joint SP-RLD candidate.Advertisement
In the 2022 Assembly polls, when the SP and RLD fought as allies, the RLD won 8 of the 33 seats it contested. In the 25 seats that the RLD lost, the BJP was by far the dominant party, winning all of them.
BJP western UP region spokesperson Gajendra Sharma suggests there is still an “if” about the RLD. “Any comment can be made only after our party leadership gives a confirmation on the alliance. As of now, we are preparing for Lok Sabha elections on every seat, including Baghpat.”
The Charan Singh effect
Given the late farmer leader’s hold across western UP, and extending to Rajasthan and poll-bound Haryana, BJP leaders describe the Modi government’s Bharat Ratna to Charan Singh as a “masterstroke”.
BJP posters on the same make it a point to thank PM Modi. The RLD’s are careful to express gratitude to “Bharat Sarkar”, making no mention of Modi.Advertisement
Jaiveer Singh, a Jat farmer from Badoli village in Baraut, dismisses Bharat Ratna as a factor. “Chaudhary Charan Singhji has always been our stalwart leader. Why did the BJP not recognise his contribution for the past 10 years? Doing this just before the elections shows their objective is political,” he says.
RLD Baghpat district president Rampal Dhama is more nuanced: “This honour for Charan Singh was due for a long time… People across all castes and communities distributed gud (jaggery) to celebrate the Bharat Ratna.”
BJP spokesperson Gajendra Sharma denies the honour had political intent, accusing past Congress governments of ignoring Charan Singh.
‘Dishaheen’ Muslim vote
In the wake of the 2022 Assembly poll results, returning the BJP to power, Jayant had organised a ‘Samrasta Abhiyan’ in western UP in May-June 2023, to foster “social harmony” as well as a “Dalit-Muslim-Jat amalgamation”.Advertisement
His decision to go with the BJP is particularly shocking for the Muslim community, which backed the RLD in both the 2022 Assembly and the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
“RLD-BJP gathbandhan ke baad Muslim dishaheen ho gaya hai (The Muslims are directionless after the RLD-BJP alliance),” says Haroon Pradhan, a Muslim Jat of Baghpat’s Osikka village, three-fourth of whose population is Muslim, adding that he won’t vote for the alliance even if the RLD gets the Baghpat seat. “Giving vote to the RLD means voting for the BJP.”
Acknowledging that the RLD has allied with the BJP in the past too (the 2009 Lok Sabha polls), Haroon says things have changed. “The BJP was different then. After 2014, the gap has widened between Hindus and Muslims… interaction has decreased. Earlier there was the issue of only one masjid in Ayodhya, now there are conflicts on several mosques.”

The RLD had not lasted long with the BJP at the time, despite winning five seats, its best Lok Sabha tally ever. It had crossed sides and joined the Manmohan Singh-led UPA II government.Advertisement
Contrary to Haroon, Mohd Yaseen, who also belongs to Osikka, says he may vote for the RLD if the Baghpat seat goes to the party. “I am a supporter of the Chaudhary family. If Jayant or an RLD leader contests, I will vote for the nalka (the RLD election symbol ‘hand pump’). But if the seat goes to the BJP and Jayant campaigns for it, I will vote for the SP,” Yaseen says.
Mohd Shakeel of Idrasipur village says: “BJP leaders do not address our problems. If the MP is of the BJP, RLD leaders too can’t help us.”
RLD district leader Dhama says the concerns are misplaced. “Is PM Modi not working for the Muslims? Everyone is getting benefits under ‘Sabka saath, sabka vikas and sabka viswas‘. The RLD is a party of all communities,” he says.
Rajendra Dhama of Gayatripuram in the Baghpat Assembly segment, who is an ex-Army man, has another theory. He says with the anti-BJP vote now consolidating behind the SP and Congress, the INDIA bloc could gain.Advertisement

Harpal Singh, a Jat farmer belonging to Halalpur village in Chhaprauli, is not impressed with the RLD-BJP alliance either, his anger directed at the Modi government’s Agniveer Army recruitment scheme.
Traditionally an RLD supporter, Harpal says: “I voted for the BJP in 2014 to remove the corrupt Congress from power. In 2019, I voted for it following the Pulwama attack (on CRPF personnel, in Kashmir). But enough now. The BJP is splitting Opposition parties. The RLD did anti-BJP politics for 10 years and has now joined it… I will vote for the SP.”
Post-farmers’ protest
As far as timing goes, the RLD and BJP couldn’t have had it worse. Days after Jayant announced he was joining the NDA, Punjab farmers started their protest demanding that MSP be legalised, and came under heavy crackdown by the BJP-led Haryana government, with Central forces providing back-up.

While there is sympathy in the largely agrarian western UP region for the protest, so far there is no monetary or physical rallying behind the agitation. Locals say no meetings have been held calling farmers to move towards Delhi or to raise funds. BKU leader Naresh Tikait backed the Grameen Bharat Bandh called by farm unions on Friday, but said he would take a call later on whether to participate in the protest held by Punjab farmers or not.
Silent this time, the RLD had participated in the 2020-21 agitation against the three Central farm laws, which were later repealed.

Waiting with his sugarcane stock outside Baghpat Cooperative Sugar Mills Limited in the Baghpat Assembly area, Mahesh Sharma says the timing of the farmers’ agitation, just before the polls, makes it appear “politically motivated”. While Sharma, a Brahmin, believes Jayant is sure to gain from tying up with the BJP, he questions his silence on the issue. “Jayant should speak in support of the farmers,” he says.
Devendra Gurjar of Santoshpur village, who is also in the queue outside the mill, says that the Punjab protesters are rich farmers. “I am a small farmer. I support them, but I don’t have time for an agitation. This is the sugarcane sale season.”
Rajendra Singh, a Jat farmer of Halalpur village, says: “The demand for MSP is genuine, but since no leader from UP is taking a stand in support of the agitation, we are waiting and watching.”
The RLD’s Dhama is also counting on this. “As of now, there is no strong support in Baghpat for the current agitation.”",politics
"Today in Politics: BJP National Council meeting set to begin in Delhi, set tone for LS poll campaign","Before the BJP’s massive election machinery begins gearing up for the Lok Sabha polls, the party’s highest decision-making body, the National Council, will meet for two days in Delhi starting Saturday to discuss and set the narrative for the elections.
From panchayat leaders to Chief Ministers, about 11,500 members from across the country are expected to make their way to the Bharat Mandapam over the next two days. Party president J P Nadda is expected to kick off the two-day conclave with an address on Saturday afternoon. Senior party leader Ravi Shankar Prasad told PTI that the council was likely to pass two resolutions: One, highlighting the prevailing political atmosphere; and two, the party’s position on the economy.
Apart from the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, the other big talking points are likely to be: the recent white paper on the UPA government tabled in Parliament by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the INDIA bloc of Opposition parties, the successful G20 summit in 2023, and the country’s global standing.Advertisement
The last big meeting of the party before the parliamentary elections, the conclave will set the tone for the party’s campaign. It will be closely observed to see if the party’s stress is on just vikas (development) or if it will contest on a mix of both welfarism and Hindutva.
In context: The PM has exuded confidence about the BJP winning more than 370 seats and the NDA crossing the 400 mark. Modi has said that the BJP’s “third tenure” will lay a strong foundation for “progress in the next 1,000 years”.
But how do the numbers stack up? 
Breaking the math down, Anjishnu Das analyses that in bipolar Assembly contests against the Congress, the BJP has largely won. The BJP has also increased its seat tally and vote share in the last two elections. After winning a majority with 282 seats in 2014, it further extended its lead by 21 seats to 303 five years later. To hit Modi’s target of 370 seats this time, the BJP will need to win 67 more seats. And now for the 2024 polls, the BJP is paying special attention to the 133 seats it contested and lost in 2019.
It is secure on the alliance front too. It has brought over the Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) and Jayant Chaudhary’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RLD), dealing a blow to the INDIA alliance, and is said to be in talks with the Akalis in Punjab and the Telugu Desam Party in Andhra Pradesh.Advertisement
In this set-up, the BJP will begin the conclave on a confident note on Saturday. But as Neerja Chowdhury writes in this week’s column, the BJP needs to listen to voices from across the country that want to be heard. Ignoring them, she argues, may be a mistake.

Kejriwal’s strategic move

While Kejriwal is expected to sail through the vote and play it up to make a political message about his strength in the Assembly, it will be more important to see how the ED and the courts proceed from here on.

"Modi’s popularity soars, why he needs to listen to voices that want to be heard, north to east to southPremium Story","It runs like a mesmerising film reel.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurating a Hindu temple in the UAE on Wednesday, signifying the outreach of a country seeking to be a “Vishwaguru” and a “Vishwabandhu” (teacher and friend of the world); earlier this week, an accommodative Qatar freeing eight Navy veterans who returned to India as free men following the quiet diplomacy led by the PM himself; and Modi, an OBC, leading the consecration ceremony of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya last month instead of a Brahmin.
These illustrate a prime minister at the peak of his power both at home and abroad. Yet, voices from different parts of India — from the north to the east to the south — are trying to make themselves heard.Advertisement
At the moment, farmers from Punjab are trying to seek a better deal for themselves with their “Dilli Chalo” cry, demanding, among other things, a legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP) for their crops. Legally guaranteed MSP is just one of the demands in their 10-point charter.

No one knows the import of optics in politics better than the PM. And yet the protesters were met with barricades, concrete slabs covered with barbed wires, and drones dropping tear gas as the BJP-led Haryana government stopped them at the Punjab border, refusing to let them through. A team of three Union Ministers, including Agriculture Minister Arjun Munda, have been engaging in dialogue with the farm unions; even after a long session on Thursday night, tear gas was used Friday morning.
One argument the farmers are making is that they need a better deal. The 2018-’19 government figures put the average income of a farmer from agriculture at Rs 27 a day. The situation, therefore, calls for urgent reforms and a safety net for the farmers. A legally guaranteed MSP is fraught but the government needs to come up with viable options as farmers in Punjab are increasingly losing their pride in being a kisan even as their relatives in the UK, USA, or even Gurgaon do much better financially.

Perils of a geographic divide
The east is also sending a message, with continuing run-ins between the state administration and the BJP in West Bengal. The violence in Sandeshkhali is the latest example and requires not only an independent inquiry into the ongoing violence but also underlines the need for the Centre and the state to sit across the table and find a way out. In the northeast, Manipur continues to be a reminder of what might have been had an early intervention taken place.Advertisement

From the south, there have been recent calls for “financial justice”. Last week, the CMs of Karnataka and Kerala came to Delhi for a “Chalo Delhi” campaign of their own, accompanied by their ministerial colleagues and MLAs, and protested against “financial excesses” by the Centre. While Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah and his team held a dharna at the Jantar Mantar on February 7, Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan followed suit the next day. Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin lent support to Vijayan.

The protest by Karnataka came days after Congress MP D K Suresh, the brother of Deputy CM D K Shivakumar, triggered a row by saying that the southern states would be compelled to demand a “separate nation for south India” if injustices against the region were not rectified. This provided the BJP with another opportunity to target the Congress, with PM Modi leading a swift counter-attack and taking the Opposition party to task for bringing up the “north-south” divide.
Siddaramaiah tried to do damage control by giving the controversy a “Centre versus state” slant with his cry for a “tax movement” and generating a “sons of the soil” sentiment in Karnataka. But it was also an attempt to bring together the southern states on a common platform around the theme of the Centre’s “step-motherly” treatment on the issue of devolution of taxes.

This is an issue that is gaining traction in the south and could become a ticking time bomb unless it is deftly dealt with. More than this, the delimitation exercise scheduled for 2026 could become another point of friction between the south and the Centre. With the rise of population share in the Hindi heartland states, and decline in the south, the southern states feel they will be penalised for what should have been lauded as their achievement. The Tamil Nadu Assembly on Wednesday passed a resolution opposing delimitation.Advertisement
With a political divide coinciding with the geographic divide, this could become problematic as the Congress and regional parties are in power in the southern states and the BJP is in the saddle in the Hindi heartland. The BJP in that case may not have the instrumentalities to navigate the southern terrain when problems arise. Thus, the PM’s southern outreach in the lead-up to the Ram Temple consecration — he visited major temples in the region with links to the Hindu deity — was a welcome step. For the same reason of stopping a political divide from turning into a geographic one, it is just as important for the Congress to revive in Uttar Pradesh and retain its hold in north India.
But then again, the BJP may decide it can ignore these voices from afar. The party can calculate that it can be home and dry with more than 300 Lok Sabha seats after sweeping the Hindi heartland on the strength of the Ram Temple issue and given that Gujarat is likely to stay by its side and Maharashtra is now on its radar.
In the past, those who have ignored these signs have rued their decision. Given Modi’s pan-India popularity and that he is on the cusp of a likely third term, he has the space to ensure that an already polarised polity doesn’t open new fault lines along geographic lines. That too when leaders who can step across the aisle and talk to the other side, or just be ready to listen, are few and far between nowadays.

"Decode Politics: As cross-voting cloud looms on Rajya Sabha polls, how open ballot came up as solution","The Rajya Sabha elections for 56 seats from 15 states, which are falling vacant in April, will be held on February 27. These states include Uttar Pradesh (10 vacancies) as well as Maharashtra and Bihar (6 vacancies each). For these 56 seats, 59 candidates are in the race — with one extra candidate than the parties can win as per their numbers in Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh and Himachal each.
While the BJP has fielded the extra candidate in Uttar Pradesh and Himachal, its ally JD(S) has done so in Karnataka, raising apprehensions of cross-voting.

Unlike the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, where ballots are secret (no one can be shown whom the vote is cast for), the Rajya Sabha polls are “open”. This means that the votes that the MLAs of each state cast to choose the members of the Upper House are seen by their party representatives.Advertisement
But this was not always the case. An election in Maharashtra in 1998 led to the change in the voting process.
First, how are Rajya Sabha members elected?
Rajya Sabha, or the Council of States, has 245 seats. Of these, 12 are nominated by the President and 233 are representatives of states and the Union territories of Delhi and Puducherry.
Rajya Sabha MPs are elected by MLAs through an indirect election. Article 80(4) provides that members shall be elected by the elected members of state Assemblies through a system of proportional representation (made on the basis of the population of each state) by means of a single transferable vote.

Rajya Sabha elections could, therefore, be foregone conclusions, with elections being held unopposed and all party candidates sailing through. This is because each party knows how much strength they have in terms of the votes of their MLAs and can field the requisite number of candidates as per those numbers. In fact, these polls were often a test of party loyalty.Advertisement
However, parties can field an extra candidate in the hope of getting another member to Parliament. This essentially necessitates a contest and opens up the possibility of cross-voting of MLAs.
How could cross-voting play out?
For example, in the forthcoming Rajya Sabha polls in UP, 10 seats are vacant. The state has 399 MLAs at the moment. As per the proportional representation system, each candidate in UP requires at least 37 votes to win.
The BJP has 252 MLAs and its NDA allies account for 34 MLAs – 13 from the Apna Dal, nine from the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), six each from the NISHAD Party and the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP). The Jansatta Dal Loktantrik, which has two MLAs, is also expected to vote in favour of the BJP.

If the BJP manages to get all these 36 votes from its allies, in addition to its own votes, its total number of votes will reach 288. However, the BJP has fielded eight candidates, meaning the party will now need 296 votes (37 multiplied by 8). The BJP will fall short hence by eight votes, setting the stage for cross-voting, potentially by SP members, who want to elect 3 MPs of its own.Advertisement
What happened in the 1998 election in Maharashtra?
Seven contenders were in the fray for six seats. The Congress had fielded two candidates — Najma Heptullah, who had served three terms in the Upper House, and Ram Pradhan, a former Maharashtra-cadre IAS officer and ex-Union home secretary. The (united) Shiv Sena’s candidates were its sitting MP Satish Pradhan and media personality Pritish Nandy. Senior leader Pramod Mahajan, who had lost the Lok Sabha elections earlier that year, was the BJP’s candidate.
There were two Independent candidates as well: media baron Vijay Darda, whom the Congress supported, and former railway minister Suresh Kalmadi, whom the Shiv Sena supported.
The Congress had enough votes to ensure the victory of both its candidates. But in a surprising turn of events, Congress candidate Ram Pradhan, a close aide of Sonia Gandhi, lost. An Independent candidate sailed through.

The votes cast by MLAs at this point were secret. Congress MLAs had clearly defied their party’s voting instructions, causing Pradhan’s defeat. Reports suggested that legislators from other parties had also cross-voted.Advertisement
Chakhsu Roy, the head of outreach at PRS legislative research, wrote in an earlier column for The Indian Express that “Pradhan’s loss reverberated in all political circles to a point that parties started thinking about steps to rein in their MLAs”.
An Ethics Committee of the Rajya Sabha that was set up in 1997, headed by Rajya Sabha MP and former Maharashtra Chief Minister S B Chavan, to come up with a solution.
What was the solution proposed?
In its first report in December 1998, the committee observed that money and muscle power played an increasing role in Rajya Sabha elections, suggesting: “In order not to allow big money and other considerations to play mischief… the Committee is of the view that instead of a secret ballot, the question of holding the elections to the Rajya Sabha and the Legislative Councils in states by open ballot may be examined.”
In 2001, then law minister Arun Jaitley introduced a Bill, bringing an amendment to the Representation of the People Act, so that the Rajya Sabha polls could be held by open ballot.Advertisement
Since then, leaders who cross-vote in the Rajya Sabha polls can be expelled by their party.
Other instances of cross-voting
Most recently, in June 2022, the BJP bagged two Rajya Sabha seats in Haryana (for which three candidates were fielded) because of cross-voting by then Congress leader Kuldeep Bishnoi. While other leaders went on to vote for their party nominees, showing their votes to their election agent, Bishnoi, who was the Congress MLA from Adampur, said he had “voted as per his inner conscience” and “did not vote for Congress nominee Ajay Maken”. Bishnoi was expelled — and he went on to join the BJP.
In the same Upper House poll cycle, the BJP in Rajasthan expelled its MLA Shobharani Kushwah for cross-voting in the Rajya Sabha polls days after she was sent a showcause notice.
Earlier, in June 2016, the Congress in Uttar Pradesh expelled six MLAs after they cross-voted for the BJP in the then Rajya Sabha polls.Advertisement
In August 2017, Congress leader Ahmed Patel got elected to the Upper House after a dramatic set of events.
The Congress had at the time filed two applications for rejection of votes tendered by two MLAs for violating the polling procedures. The party claimed the MLAs had shown their ballot papers to Amit Shah (who was among the Rajya Sabha) MPs elected from Gujarat that year. The petition was first rejected by the Returning Officer.
On rejection, a delegation of Congress leaders met with Election Commission officials in New Delhi and raised objections to the RO’s decision. The EC took into consideration the Congress’ plea and declared that the two MLAs had violated polling procedures and secrecy of the ballot. The two votes were disqualified, — and the number of votes required were brought down from 46 to 44. Patel had the 44 votes and he secure a fifth term in the Rajya Sabha.",politics
‘IT penalty of Rs 135 cr on us … For what? Doesn’t IT want democracy to survive?’: CongressPremium Story,"Senior advocate and Rajya Sabha MP Vivek Tankha appeared before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) on Friday to argue against the Income Tax Department’s decision to freeze the Congress’s main bank accounts on February 14. In an interview, he talks about the case against the party, what he told the tribunal, and the legal options before the party.
The Congress on Friday announced that Income Tax authorities had frozen its main bank accounts. What is the dispute about?
There was an assessment for the financial year 2018-’19. That assessment was completed with an addition of approximately Rs 103 crore plus interest, which came to Rs 135 crore. And that assessment had been upheld by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals). We appealed against that in the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in May 2023. It was pending a hearing and the date for final arguments is fixed in April. In between, on February 14, they froze all our bank accounts. Notices were sent to bankers to freeze all the transactions. On that day, we had approximately Rs 210 crore in our accounts.
What did you tell the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal?Advertisement
My first argument was that when we have approximately Rs 210 crore in our accounts and the claim is for Rs 135 crore, why should you freeze all the accounts? You cannot freeze more than what we owe you finally, even if we don’t succeed in winning the appeal.
Secondly, I said elections are a festival of democracy. We, the Congress, are one of the largest stakeholders of this festival. And on the eve of the festival, if you are choking us completely, then this stakeholder will be out of that festival. So, I asked whether the IT Department doesn’t want democracy to survive in India.
Thirdly, I said the Congress had an income of approximately Rs 199 crore. We had an approved expenditure of Rs 197.5 crore. We had a surplus of Rs 1.5 crore. So, set aside the entire return and reject everything that I have done and say that the whole thing is taxable, it is a disproportionate action. And for what? They are saying we were 15 days late. In my view, we were not late. My date was till March 31. I filed it in early February. That is the issue. Whether we were late or not. Even if I were late, there is a concept of real income and expenditure without any exemptions. When all that has happened, how can you do this? It is a disproportionate penalty of Rs 135 crore … For what? What have we done? If this is not choking, then what is choking?
Since when has this dispute been going on?
In 2021, there was an order by the Assessment Officer. Then we filed an appeal before the Appellate Commissioner, which was decided in early 2023, against which we filed an appeal before ITAT in May 2023. I told the Tribunal that as an Additional Solicitor General when I used to appear for the Income Tax (Department), Chief Justice (S H) Kapadia would always tell me that an assessee had practically no real opportunity in the first stage and second stage. That is when you are before departmental officers. The first independent opportunity comes only when you come before ITAT. I cited this and told the Tribunal that it is my first independent opportunity for justice.
What did the appellate tribunal say?Advertisement
We sought a stay on the order freezing our accounts and sought their de-freezing … told them that we would only maintain a lien. So the Tribunal agreed … We have to maintain a minimum account. They said Rs 115 crore would be the lien. We can operate our accounts. The tribunal will hear the matter next Wednesday before a final decision is taken on the matter.
What does this mean for your daily operations?
On Wednesday, they (the tribunal) will hear the interim application and decide what terms and conditions have to be imposed. That crisis of not being able to operate our accounts is over.
What will be your legal option if the tribunal rules against you?
We will approach the High Court. But we are hopeful that we will get a good order in ITAT. It was very gracious of the Tribunal to have intervened in favour of the assessee and allowed us to operate the bank accounts. We are an over 130-year-old party. And we are one of the biggest stakeholders in the current elections. Can you have the festival of democracy without the Congress?Advertisement
The bank accounts were frozen a day before the Supreme Court verdict on electoral bonds …
The government is only getting bad publicity. They are not getting good publicity.",politics
"Election bonds order: A look at other Modi govt policy decisions challenged in SC, and what followedPremium Story","The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled the electoral bonds scheme for political funding introduced by the Narendra Modi government as unconstitutional. It was not the first policy decision of the Modi government to be challenged in court, with a majority of the rulings going the government’s way. A few cases are still pending in the apex court.
Aadhaar
The Aadhaar scheme was introduced by the UPA government through a notification of the erstwhile Planning Commission. It was not backed by a legislation which led to a challenge before the Supreme Court.
In 2016, the Modi government introduced the project through a legislation in the Lok Sabha and was got it passed as a Money Bill — which was seen as a move to circumvent the Rajya Sabha, where the NDA did not have the numbers, as the Upper House has only limited powers when it comes to a Money Bill.Advertisement
Also read | The Aadhaar journey: From flagship Cong project to cornerstone of BJP’s ‘Digital India’
This was challenged in the Supreme Court in 2017 by Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, who said the Centre’s decision to treat the Bill as a Money Bill was wrong.
In January 2018, a five-judge Bench began hearing the case and in September upheld the constitutional validity of the law, but struck down provisions that required linking of Aadhaar to mobile phones and children’s’ school admission.
Citizenship (Amendment) Act
The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, was passed in the Lok Sabha, making it easier for immigrants belonging to minority religions from neighbouring countries, who had entered India on or before December 31, 2014, to get Indian citizenship — thus covering the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, Christian communities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, and essentially leaving out Muslims.
After the Act was notified in 2020, its constitutional validity was immediately challenged by the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) in the Supreme Court, claiming it violated Article 14 of the Constitution. Article 14 guarantees equality to all persons (not only citizens) before the law and equal protection of law.Advertisement
The CAA also led to widespread protests across the country. The Court is currently hearing 200 similar petitions in the case.
Abrogation of Article 370
In August 2019, the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill was passed in Parliament. The Act abrogated Article 370, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, and bifurcated the state into two Union Territories – Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.
Must read | Article 370 abrogation upheld: How SC answered three key questions in the government’s favour
Its constitutional validity was challenged in the Supreme Court in the same month. A three-judge Bench referred the case to a five-judge Bench. In 2023, the case was listed before a new five-judge Bench. In July 2023, the Bench started hearing the case and in December upheld the constitutional validity of the law.
Control of National Capital Territory (NCT)
The Centre and Delhi government’s tussle over control of ‘services’ in the National Capital Territory reached the Supreme Court after the Centre, in March 2021, enacted the Government of National Capital Territory (Amendment) Act, which diluted the Delhi government’s administrative powers and placed them with the Lieutenant Governor. The Act effectively overruled the Supreme Court’s 2018 verdict, which had said the Chief Minister was the executive head of the NCT and not the L-G.Advertisement

The Delhi government in August 2021 challenged the Act in the Supreme Court. In 2023, the Court held that the Delhi government has administrative control over ‘services’.
Soon after, in May 2023, the Centre promulgated an ordinance restricting the control of the Delhi government on ‘services’. This was challenged again in the apex court, which in July 2023 referred the matter to a five-judge Constitution Bench.
National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC)
The NJAC Bill was introduced in Parliament in August 2014, soon after the Modi government’s first term had begun, and received the President’s assent on August 15, 2014. It aimed to replace the existing collegium system of appointment of judges with a panel comprising the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, CJI and two eminent persons, to be selected by the panel. The Centre also argued that the NJAC would ensure transparency in the selection and transfer of judges.
However, the petitioners argued that the NJAC will lead to excessive role of the Executive in the Judiciary. The Supreme Court advocates-on-record moved the apex court against it, and the law was struck down in October 2015.Advertisement
Farm laws
The three contentious farm laws, which were repealed by the Centre, following a year-long protest by farmers, also had to face legal challenges.
The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, were passed by Parliament in September 2020 and were challenged by several petitioners, alleging that they would adversely impact the farmers and create a private market. Allowing of trade outside of APMCs, the farmers asserted, would enable private and large companies to procure produce at incidental prices.
In January 2021, the apex court ordered an interim stay on their implementation.
Appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners
In December 2023, the Centre moved the Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Bill and passed it in Parliament amid a walkout by the Opposition in the Lok Sabha.Advertisement
The Act, among other things, said that the three-member panel to elect the chief election commissioner and election commissioners would comprise the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition and a Union Minister. Before this, while there was no law to govern the selection, the Chief Justice of India was part of the panel.
The Act was challenged in the Supreme Court by Congress leader Jaya Thakur. Recently, ahead of the panel’s meeting to select the new CEC, lawyer Prashant Bhushan moved the apex court seeking an interim stay on the law. However, the Supreme Court refused a stay and said the matter would be heard when Thakur’s plea comes up for hearing in April.
Extension of tenures of ED, CBI chiefs
The NDA government passed the Central Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Act, 2021, and the Delhi Special Police Establishment (Amendment) Act, 2021, in December last year, a month after it promulgated ordinances on the same. The law allows the government to extend the tenures of the ED and CBI chief by one year three times, as against the previous provision of extending it only once.
The Bill was challenged in the Supreme Court, with petitioner Jaya Thakur alleging that “piecemeal” tenure extensions would be detrimental to the overall independence of the investigative bodies as it permits a ‘carrot and stick’ policy. This would potentially violate the right to fair investigation and trial.Advertisement
While the apex court upheld the constitutional validity of the law, it declared the extension given to ED chief S K Mishra as unconstitutional. However, it allowed him to continue, in “national interest”.
Demonetisation
On November 8 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an address to the nation, made the shock announcement which made Rs 500, Rs 1,000 currency notes illegal.

In December 2022, the apex court reserved its verdict and directed the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to make public records. In January 2023, the Bench, in a 4-1 ruling, upheld the validity of the Centre’s decision noting that the decision making process was not flawed.
Some other policies like the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the Central Vista Redevelopment Project have been challenged in the apex court at various times during the Modi government’s two tenures. The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutional validity of all these decisions of the Centre.",politics
"Two senior leaders not in race, is BJP toning down its Lok Sabha poll plans for TN?","THE fact that two leading figures of the Tamil Nadu BJP, state chief K Annamalai and Union minister L Murugan, will not be contesting the Lok Sabha elections is being seen as a sign that the party’s plans for the state, where it is trying to make inroads, have hit a bump.
The AIADMK parted ways from the BJP-led NDA last year, leaving the BJP without a major local ally in the state. While the BJP has been hopeful of wooing the AIADMK back, the regional party is holding back in the face of the DMK’s rise, riding a strident anti-Centre stand.
The BJP state unit, which has been looking at the central leadership for guidance, had picked up cues that Annamalai may take the plunge and contest from either Coimbatore, Tirupur or Pollachi. Sources said local leaders had been told to prepare for “a high-profile candidate” and “a major campaign” involving Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Advertisement
Also read | BJP holds out hope for AIADMK’s NDA return, but Palaniswami unmoved
Similarly, Murugan was seen as short-listed to take on the DMK’s sitting MP, A Raja, from the reserved constituency of Nilgiris.
The fact that both will sit out the Lok Sabha polls could be construed as the BJP being apprehensive about losing, party leaders admitted. The BJP had not won any seat from Tamil Nadu in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, when it fought in alliance with the AIADMK.
Annamalai’s announcement that he was not in the running for polls came as more of a surprise since he has long been seen as the BJP’s face for Tamil Nadu, and since his appointment as state chief, has taken an unapologetically aggressive stand, at the cost of alienating even BJP-friendly parties.
On Wednesday, it was Annamalai who announced that Murugan was being renominated to the Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh, and went on to rule out that he might contest the Lok Sabha elections.Advertisement
Describing Murugan’s renomination as “the happiest news”, Annamalai argued that the BJP’s appeals asking “people to prepare the Nilgiris constituency” for the Union minister was only on account of the fact that Murugan is in-charge of the seat.
On his own candidacy, Annamalai said that he is “already roaming around the state”, “unable to finish the work” given to him, and dismissed speculation about him contesting. Speaking about Coimbatore specifically, he said the BJP had many capable leaders in the area who had served the party and also won elections. “We will announce the best candidate there,” Annamalai said.
A senior BJP leader from western Tamil Nadu and a senior RSS leader from Coimbatore both expressed surprise at Wednesday’s announcement as well as the way it was presented before the public.

While admiring Annamalai’s confidence, another leader said he should also face accountability for his actions. “If we had successfully contested in an alliance with the AIADMK, we might have won one-two seats maximum, and the vote share may not have crossed 9%. Now, contesting alone and fielding candidates in all the seats means we could touch up to 15% vote share even if we don’t win a seat. But the way Annamalai conveyed the decision regarding his and Murugan’s candidature sent the wrong optics,” a veteran BJP leader said.Advertisement
Many also blamed Annamalai’s “abrasiveness” for the AIADMK’s decision to leave the NDA, and said this was the reason that the party was being forced to moderate its Lok Sabha aspirations. The AIADMK had quit after repeated attacks from the state BJP chief, with Annamalai maintaining that the BJP did not need an alliance in the state.
“Annamalai’s strategy may be fruitful in the long term… but it has left the BJP facing a big challenge in elections. In such a scenario, he should be the one leading the party into the polls and emerging as its face,” a senior BJP leader said.
The veteran leader pointed out that further that Annamalai might not have any choice in the matter if the high command decided he had to contest. Why should he make statements like he will not contest, the leader said.
State BJP spokesperson Narayanan Thirupathy argued that Annamalai’s stand was not new and that he has always said that he would not contest the Lok Sabha polls. Murugan not contesting from Nilgiris was also known, he said.Advertisement
“All this was largely speculation. The party won’t face any problem due to the two not contesting Lok Sabha. When we have valuable, active cadres, leaders across the state, Murugan and Annamalai have the bigger responsibility of touring constituencies,” he said.",politics
"Farm stir upsets SAD, BJP reconciliation plan, Akalis press pause, BJP’s rural push takes a hit","The Punjab farmer unions’ “Dilli Chalo” agitation is heating up state politics with the Lok Sabha elections just round the corner. It has already had an impact on the attempts being made by former NDA allies, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the BJP, to reach out to each other in a bid to restitch their alliance for the upcoming polls.
Both camps are closely tracking the outcome of the talks undertaken by the BJP-ruled Centre with the agitating farmer bodies to resolve the standoff.
The third round of talks between farm unions and three Union ministers — Piyush Goyal, Arjun Munda and Nityanand Rai — on farmers’ various demands — including a law on minimum support price (MSP) for crops and loan waivers — concluded on a “positive note” on Thursday-Friday night. They will meet again on Sunday evening, with the meetings also involving Chief Minister and AAP leader Bhagwant Mann.Advertisement

The Sukhbir Badal-led SAD has already expressed solidarity with the protesting farmers, with the party’s core committee, its highest decision-making body, going into huddle on Thursday to deliberate on the fast-developing situation.
The SAD core committee, while reiterating the party’s full support to the farmers, decided that the party should not pursue a re-alliance with the BJP until a solution is found for redressal of their grievances.
A member of this top SAD panel told The Indian Express that a majority of its members were of the view that “at this stage and till the issues of farmers are resolved and the farm agitation ends, Akali Dal must not explore an alliance with BJP”.

Another senior Akali leader said, “Though 75 per cent of the top party leaders were of the view that having an alliance with BJP was in the interests of both the parties, but citing the farm stir, they said Akali Dal should desist from having an alliance at this stage. All were unanimous not to go ahead with any alliance talks till the concerns of farmers are resolved”.Advertisement
The farming community has always remained the core support base of the SAD. In September 2020, Akalis had walked out of the NDA despite being the oldest BJP ally to protest the Narendra Modi-led government’s now-repealed farm laws over which scores of farm unions held year-long agitation on Delhi’s borders during 2020-21.
The Akali Dal has now been at its lowest ebb politically after having suffered back-to-back defeats in the Punjab Assembly polls in 2017 and 2022.
In the 2017 polls, when the NDA was intact, the SAD won 15 seats and the BJP 3 out of the total 117, with the Congress clinching the polls by bagging 77 seats. The Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP had then made a stunning Assembly poll debut in the state, winning 20 seats to edge out the SAD and become the principal Opposition party.
In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, out of 13 seats in Punjab, the SAD got two seats and the BJP two as against the Congress’s eight and the AAP’s one seat.Advertisement
In the 2022 Assembly polls, when the ex-NDA allies contested separately with Akalis joining hands with the BSP, the SAD’s tally plunged to three seats as against the Congress’s 18 seats and the BJP’s 2 seats. The AAP swept the polls by winning 92 seats.
Akalis have always banked on farmers’ support, with its governments known for rolling out various welfare schemes for them.

The current farm stir has also come as a setback to the BJP, which has been trying to make inroads into rural Punjab two years after it suffered hugely from the ramifications of the movement against the farm laws. Another spell of farm agitation would deal a blow to the BJP’s bid to expand its base in the state beyond its core vote bank of urban Hindus.
Throughout their alliance, the SAD contested 10 Lok Sabha seats, leaving three seats — Hoshiarpur, Gurdaspur and Amritsar — to the BJP. The party has been looking to stake its claim over more seats this time in the event of restoration of their alliance as the SAD is no longer the electoral force it used to be earlier.Advertisement
However, if the farm stir continue, it would also put the BJP on back foot and reduce its bargaining strength vis-a-vis Akalis. “Things have changed now. Farm agitation is at a very critical stage. It will have major repercussions for both BJP and Akali Dal. We are representative of agrarian community. We have to tread very cautiously now. Alliance keep on happening and breaking. But, we cannot afford to lose one of our core support base,” a senior Akali leader told The Indian Express.
As the farm agitation started amid reports of Akali warming up to the BJP, the BSP on Tuesday broke its alliance with the SAD and declared that it will go solo in Punjab in the upcoming polls. The BSP leadership blamed the SAD’s seat-sharing talks with the BJP for its decision, even citing Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s remarks in this regard.
SAD secretary general Balwinder Singh Bhunder, however, claimed it was the BSP’s “unilateral announcement” merely on the basis of media reports. “Has Sukhbir Badal ever said that talks were on with the BJP? Have I ever said so? No responsible party leaders made such statements,” Bhunder told The Indian Express.",politics
"How 17th Lok Sabha performed: One-third of Bills passed under an hour, record suspensions, lengthy interruptions","From the passage of some key and controversial Bills, many after little to no discussion, to the move to the new Parliament building where MPs were suspended in record-high numbers, the curtains have fallen on the 17th Lok Sabha.
As the focus starts shifting towards the parliamentary elections, here are the highlights of the 17th Lok Sabha and the numbers behind them, as per data from the Lok Sabha and PRS Legislative Research.
Productivity
Since the first Lok Sabha convened between 1952 and 1957, the number of sittings has consistently declined over the years. While the first Lok Sabha convened for an annual average of 135 days across all sessions, the 16th and 17th Lok Sabhas (of the NDA government) met for 66 and 55 days per year. The number of sitting days was marginally higher in the UPA I and II eras, at 66 and 71 days per year, respectively.Advertisement
During the term of the 17th Lok Sabha, legislators met for 15 sessions, including curtailed sessions during the Covid-19 pandemic and the Special Session last September. The 17th Lok Sabha kicked off with a productive Budget Session in 2019, with 25 sittings and working overtime for 135% of the scheduled time. The number of sittings peaked at 37 in the Budget Session last year but it was one of the least productive ones, functioning for just 33% of the scheduled time.
 Sittings and productivity
At a total of 274, just the four Lok Sabhas that were dissolved before the end of their five-year terms held fewer sittings than this one.
In terms of hours spent working, particularly discussing and passing Bills, there was a marked decline during the 17th Lok Sabha. From 281 total hours of work and 125 hours spent on Bills in the 2019 Budget Session, the Lok Sabha’s working hours fell to 62 overall and 37 on Bills in the 2023 Winter Session.
Over the 15 sessions of this Lok Sabha, just four spent 35 hours or more on discussing and passing Bills. In the 2023 Budget Session, the Lok Sabha spent just over an hour on discussing and passing legislation.Advertisement
 Time spent functioning and on government Bills
Bills passed
Across its 15 sessions, the number of Bills introduced and passed by the 17th Lok Sabha gradually declined. While 35 Bills were passed in the 2019 Budget Session, the highest for this term, and as few as six in the 2023 Budget Session.
A total of 221 Bills were passed in the 17th Lok Sabha, up from 180 in the previous one. However, more than a third of them were passed with less than an hour of discussion, 13% with 1-2 hours of discussion, 22% with 2-3 hours, and 30% with more than 3 hours of debate. Just 16% of the Bills were referred to standing committees for further scrutiny, declining from 28% in the previous Lok Sabha and well below the 60% and 71% when the first and second UPA governments were in power.
 Bills introduced and passed
Apart from the abrogation of Article 370, during this term Parliament passed Bills to ban triple talaq and amend the Citizenship Act. It also cleared three controversial farm laws, which triggered year-long protests by farmers’ groups across north India until the laws were eventually repealed. The Centre and the Delhi government clashed over a Bill that diluted the administrative powers of the elected government and placed them with the Centrally appointed Lieutenant Governor. The Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners Bill, which changed the composition of the appointing panel by replacing the Chief Justice of India with a Union Minister, was also passed. Among the other landmark Bills passed by the 17th Lok Sabha are the three new laws to overhaul the existing criminal codes and the Women’s Reservation Bill.
Interruptions, walkouts and suspensions
It wasn’t all smooth sailing in Parliament though. All but two sessions of the 17th Lok Sabha witnessed lengthy interruptions and walkouts staged by members of the Opposition.Advertisement
 Interruptions and late sittings
In the 2023 Budget Session, the House lost 96 hours to interruptions and adjournments, the highest for this Lok Sabha. In total, 435 hours were lost to interruptions since the first session. The highest instances of walkouts came in the first Budget Session at 30, followed by 19 in the 2022 Budget Session.
 Walkouts
To make up for lost time and ensure legislative and other business was completed, the House spent a total of 300 hours sitting late over the past five years, including for 73 hours in the 2019 Budget Session.
The 17th Lok Sabha also set the record for most MP suspensions at 115, with 100 of those coming in the 2023 Winter Session during which members of the Opposition protested against the government’s refusal to discuss the security breach that saw two intruders jump into the House and toss gas canisters.
The previous Lok Sabha saw the second-highest total suspensions at 81. Before that, the eighth Lok Sabha during the Congress’s rule from 1984 to 1989 had seen the most suspensions at 66.Advertisement
 Suspensions
This Lok Sabha was also notable for the absence of a Deputy Speaker. Despite the Constitution mandating the election of a Speaker and Deputy Speaker, the 17th Lok Sabha was the first to go an entire term without a Deputy Speaker.
The Monsoon Session in 2023 also saw the only no-confidence motion in this Lok Sabha, and the second against the Modi government. Both times, the ruling BJP had enough votes to win.
Performance of MPs
On average, MPs had a 79% attendance record, down marginally from 80% in the previous House. More than two-thirds of MPs attended more than 80% of the session. Even in the sessions held during the Covid-19 pandemic, average attendance did not fall below 69%. The highest average attendance was in the 2023 Special Session.
The highest attendance, at 100%, was recorded by three first-time BJP MPs – Bhagirath Chaudhary from Rajasthan, Sunita Duggal from Haryana and Mohan Mandavi from Chhattisgarh.Advertisement
The average MP participated in 45 debates over five years. BJP MP Pushpendra Singh Chandel was the most active MP, participating in 1,261 debates, followed by the Congress’s Kuldeep Rai Sharma from Andaman and Nicobar Islands at 834. The only other MP to participate in more than 500 discussions was the BSP’s Malook Nagar who took part in 606 debates. Notably, actor-politicians Sunny Deol of the BJP and Shatrughan Sinha of the TMC were among nine Lok Sabha members who did not participate in any debate.
While the average MP asked 199 questions in Parliament, 21 did not ask a single question and 25 asked more than 500 each. BJP MP Sukanta Majumdar, the party’s West Bengal state president, asked the most questions at 654, followed by Shiv Sena MP Shrirang Appa Barne and BJP MP Sudhir Gupta at 635 each.",politics
"Key RJD backroom operator, Tejashwi Yadav’s advisor now RS nominee: Who is Sanjay Yadav?","Having worked behind the scenes with Tejashwi Yadav for more than a decade, the former Bihar Deputy Chief Minister’s political advisor Sanjay Yadav has been rewarded with a Rajya Sabha nomination. The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) sprung a surprise by nominating the 41-year-old Yadav on Wednesday, leaving out retiring MP Aafaq Karim.
Though Yadav, who is from Haryana, officially is the RJD leader’s political advisor, he has been more of a “friend, philosopher, and guide” to him, according to party insiders. He was one of the key RJD men along with MP Manoj Jha who negotiated Nitish’s switch from the NDA to the Mahagathbandhan in August 2022.
Sanjay hails from a political family and was introduced to Tejashwi by Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav due to his good insight into socialist politics. He initially started working with Tejashwi in Delhi and later in Patna, where he groomed the former Deputy CM by making him listen to and read the speeches of socialist stalwarts. He also conducted mock interviews for Tejashwi to prepare him for interactions with big media houses.Advertisement

It was Sanjay Yadav who in 2015 spotted RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s remark on the “need to review quotas” and took it up with RJD national president Lalu Prasad who then raised it as a poll plank. This is seen as a major factor that contributed to the Opposition alliance’s electoral success in the 2015 Assembly polls in which it won 178 seats. The RJD emerged as the single-largest party with 80 seats.
Sources said having served as Deputy CM twice, Tejashwi backed the Upper House candidature of his go-to person behind the scenes. “Though his loyalty (to Tejashwi) is the prime reason for Sanjay’s nomination, Tejashwi may have pushed for him to ensure a solid base in Delhi. He could also set up an office at Sanjay’s place to work from the capital,” said an RJD leader.
The INDIA bloc’s other two candidates who have been renominated are RJD MP Manoj Kumar Jha and Bihar Congress chief Akhilesh Prasad Yadav. The Mahagathbandhan has numbers in the Assembly to win three of the six Rajya Sabha seats from the state in the February 27 polls. The NDA — comprising the BJP, JD(U), Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), and an Independent — has 128 MLAs in the 243-member House while the Opposition alliance has 113 legislators. The AIMIM has a lone legislator and one seat is vacant.",politics
"Former CECs welcome SC judgment on electoral bonds, say ECI’s concerns addressed","Former Chief Election Commissioners (CECs) Thursday welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision of declaring the electoral bond scheme unconstitutional, noting that it addressed concerns raised by the Election Commission of India (ECI), including the potential for funnelling funds from shell companies and money laundering.
Former CEC O P Rawat, who was the Election Commissioner in 2017, had raised concerns with the government when the scheme was being discussed. He said Thursday’s judgment has “addressed all concerns of the EC about shell companies and loss-making firms funnelling money through electoral bonds”.
“The Supreme Court judgment has ushered in a big electoral reform. While it won’t have a major impact on the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, as the polls are too close and parties would have mobilised resources already, the election arena will be improved,” Rawat said.Advertisement
He said the problem of black money in political funding, which was one of the arguments of the government in favour of introducing the scheme, had not been “obliterated” by the scheme. He said a cap on political parties funding would be a way to address that.
According to Finance Ministry documents obtained under RTI, Rawat had “expressed doubts that the electoral bonds can be misused by shell companies” during a meeting on September 22, 2017, where then Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg briefed the EC about the scheme.

Another former CEC, S Y Quraishi, said the judgment was a boost for transparency. “Every single objection that Constitutional experts had raised has been addressed by the Supreme Court in our favour. SBI has been asked to give the electoral bond information to the ECI to make it public. Political parties cannot drag their feet and delay the disclosure. It is a victory for democracy in India,” he told The Indian Express.
SY Quraishi writes | By striking down Electoral Bonds Scheme, Supreme Court has lived up to its role of democracy’s guardian angel
Former CEC Navin Chawla, too, welcomed the judgment. “It is an extremely important judgment because the ECI has for years been seeking means to increase transparency on where the funds for elections come from and where they’re spent. The electoral bond scheme was shrouded in mystery from the start. It went in the face of transparency, and that has been unravelled today.”Advertisement
He said the judgment comes at a critical time when political parties are preparing for the upcoming general elections. “The transparency that has been sought has been brought about now. There is no choice for the ECI but to defer to the SC judgment and make the details public. It is a step worth applauding,” Chawla said.
Even as T S Krishnamurthy echoed his former colleagues in his appreciation for the top court, he said the government should now bring in a transparent mechanism of electoral funding.
Asked what he thinks a good alternative would be, he said, “I have said this in the past that there should be a national election fund where people can donate and then this corpus can be used to conduct the elections. Corporates and individuals should not directly donate to a political party.”",politics
"Electoral bonds and regional parties: TMC, DMK getting donations only via bonds since 2022-23, BJD from a year ago","Over the past six financial years since its introduction in 2018, electoral bonds have replaced all traditional forms of funding for at least three political parties — TMC, DMK, and BJD — now exclusively receiving all donations above Rs 20,000 through this method.
Over half of all donations through electoral bonds, around Rs 6,500 crore, has gone to the BJP. However, significantly, for the ruling regional parties TMC, BJD, and DMK, electoral bonds began to dominate other forms of funding and completely overshadowed others in 2022-23.
The Indian Express looked at the annual audit accounts of state parties over the last six years and found that the TMC, which is in power in West Bengal, received nothing through electoral bonds in the first year 2017-18, then Rs 97 crore in 2018-19, Rs 100 crore in 2019-20, Rs 42 crore in 2020-21, Rs 528 crore in 2021-22 and Rs 325 crore in 2022-23. The share of bonds in TMC’s total donations above Rs 20,000 increased from zero in 2017-2018 to 68.72% in 2018-19, 92.55% in 2019-20, 99.49% in 2020-21, 99.92% in 2021-2022 and 99.38% in 2022-23.Advertisement
Similarly, the DMK, in power in Tamil Nadu, got no funding through bonds in the first two years, but since then the share of bonds in its total contributions (above Rs 20,000) has increased to almost 100%. From 94.18% in 2019-2020 when it received Rs 45 crore through this channel, the share of bonds in the DMK’s donations dipped in 2020-21 to 70.17%, before increasing to 99.3% in 2021-22 and 99.26% in 2022-23. It received Rs 306 crore and Rs 185 crore in the last two financial years via bonds.
In BJD’s case, electoral bonds have been becoming an increasingly popular instrument of donation since 2018-19 in which it received Rs 213 crore (or 87.9%). Since then, the share of bonds in the total contributions (of over Rs 20,000) of the party has only increased to 99.99% in 2020-2021 and 100% in 2021-22 (Rs 291 crore) and 2022-23 (Rs 152 crore).
The impact of the SC verdict on these three parties is unclear at the moment. TN Chief Minister M K Stalin welcomed the SC judgment saying, “The Hon’ble Supreme Court has rightly held that the Electoral Bonds are unconstitutional. This will ensure a transparent electoral process and the integrity of the system.”
TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said, “People have a right to know the source of funds received through electoral bonds. We welcome the Supreme Court’s decision. We feel that one political party, which had introduced the electoral bonds, will cease to exist.”Advertisement
Other regional parties that have had a majority of their contributions come from EBs are BRS which had an average of 55% of all voluntary contributions in the form of EBs, and the YSRCP, whose average was 66%. In the election year of 2019-20, BRS got 99.54% of its donations in EBs, which dipped to zero in 2020-21 and again jumped to 79% and 77% in 2021-22 and 2022-23, respectively. The YSRCP had 99.99% of its donations in the form of EBs in 2020-21.
Over the six years, State Bank of India has sold a total of 12,008.59 crore in EBs, as per a Right to Information reply to The Indian Express.",politics
"As farm protests continue, BJP feels the heat in Punjab, its leaders choose silence","AS DAYS pass by and the renewed farmers’ protest across Punjab and Haryana continue, Sunil Jakhar’s face is conspicuous by its absence at the barricades that the BJP-led Haryana government has erected to prevent Punjab farmers from crossing over in their march towards Delhi.
A popular face during the 2020-21 farmers’ protest against the three Central farm laws, when he was the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president, Jakhar is now the Punjab BJP president, having hopped over in May 2022.
Punjab’s BJP leaders have so far maintained silence over the issue, as well as over the role of the Haryana government, led by the BJP. During the 2020 agitation against the farm laws, the then PPCC president had been the first to address a public meeting against the ordinance on the three farm laws, on June 5. The Fatehgarh Sahib rally was attended by all Punjab Congress MLAs. At another protest in Nawanshahr on June 29, 2020, where Jakhar and other Congress leaders had pulled a tractor with ropes, he had even declared that the farm laws were pro-corporate.Advertisement

Underlining his leading role in the 2020-21 farmer protests, Jakhar had also written to then Haryana Governor V P Singh Badnore on September 22, 2020, complaining that the Haryana government had prevented a Punjab Youth Congress-led tractor march from Chandigarh to Delhi. When the Punjab Congress, between October 4 and October 6, 2020, followed up by holding a tractor march across the state to protest the farm laws, Jakhar was seen driving the tractor Rahul Gandhi rode, when he visited the state to join the protest.
When The Indian Express approached Jakhar, he said, “I’ll give my response to the issue in a day or two. Let the talks happen.”
Wait and watch
Sources said the state BJP leadership has been asked to wait and watch as talks between farmer bodies and the Union government are underway.
For the BJP, prospects in Punjab — where the party has rapidly spread in areas previously monopolised by its former electoral ally the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) — suddenly appear uncertain.Advertisement

With the Haryana government cracking down on the protesting farmers, including with harsh measures they are once again angry at the party. In his mid-20s, Gurwinder Singh from Mandi Kalan village of Bathinda said, “BJP waleain nu hun pinda vich vadan nahi dena (We won’t let BJP leaders enter our villages now).”
Even Amarinder Singh, former Punjab CM and Congress leader who has moved to the BJP and who is known for his independent opinions, has maintained his distance from the entire episode. Singh too had been vocal during the 2020-21 agitation, and, as the then Congress CM, had passed a resolution against the farm laws in the Vidhan Sabha.

The BJP’s National Kisan Morcha is also feeling the heat. Its former vice-president Satwant Singh Punia told The Indian Express: “I remember farmers sitting on dharna outside my house in Sangrur for over 14 months in 2020-21. The farm laws were repealed and the government made promises to the farmers. Hence, I appeal to the Centre to agree to the genuine demands of farmer unions to prevent unrest in the country.”
He, however, added, “I want to question the timing of the protest so close to the Lok Sabha polls. Why didn’t these unions take any action before? Also, why are they not questioning the state government over the many pending issues in the state itself? The integrity of these unions is in doubt. However, as a farmer, I want the Union government to meet the farmers’ demands.”Advertisement
A rare BJP leader who was vocal in support of the farmers in 2020-21, and coordinated with the protesting farmers during the first few rounds of talks this time, is former Punjab Cabinet minister Surjit Kumar Jayani. He said, “In Punjab, farmers largely grow wheat and paddy, for which they are getting MSP… Everything can be sorted out through mutual coordination. I think talks should be the only way to put forth demands.”",politics
"BJP’s surprise RS pick in UP, Sanjay Seth: Realty tycoon, ex-aide of Mulayam, Akhilesh","Setting the stage for a potentially dramatic contest in the forthcoming Rajya Sabha polls in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP on Thursday fielded party leader Sanjay Seth in the fray as its eighth candidate.
UP is slated to send 10 MPs to the Upper House in the elections scheduled for February 27. As the numbers stand now, the ruling BJP and the principal Opposition Samajwadi Party (SP), appear to have enough members in the state Assembly to elect their seven and three Rajya Sabha MPs, respectively. The number of votes required for each candidate is 37, as per the system of proportional representation followed in the RS polls.

However, by nominating Seth as its eighth candidate, the BJP has upped the ante and forced an election, even though it falls short of eight votes to push his nomination through. This opens up the possibility of cross-voting.Advertisement
What makes the face-off interesting besides putting the SP on the back foot is Seth’s past relations with the SP led by Akhilesh Yadav. Seth had served as the SP MP in the Upper House between 2016 and 2019.

He resigned from the SP on August 6, 2019, three months before his Rajya Sabha tenure ended, and went on to join the BJP days later.
Old SP connection
Seth is also considered one of the leading real-estate developers in Lucknow. He set up his company, SAS Hotels and Properties Private Limited, in 1985. It was later renamed the Shalimar Corporation.
During the tenure of the Mayawati-led BSP government between 2007-12, Seth’s company took on major projects such as the Dr BR Ambedkar Gomti Vihar Park (Part-1 and Part- 2), a multi-level parking space in Hazratganj and another parking lot in Vridawan colony near the Rae Bareli Road. The company’s project, the Jai Prakash Narayan International Centre (JPNIC) in Lucknow, has been put on halt for the last seven years due to lack of funds.Advertisement
Seth has been active politically alongside his business career, maintaining strong ties with the SP first family. Seth had shared close ties with SP founder late Mulayam Singh Yadav and his son Prateek Yadav, who is the step-brother of Akhilesh. An SP leader said Seth had even designed and developed the houses for Mulayam and Akhilesh.

In 2015, Seth was even nominated by the SP as an MLC candidate. But the then UP Governor Ram Naik had rejected Seth’s name along with four others, “as not being worthy of nomination”. Sending back Seth’s file, the Governor had sought details about an IT department search on the Shalimar company’s offices. “It is a normal search procedure for any company,” Seth had then said.
The SP first family was dealing with internal strife during that period. This had reached a flashpoint on December 28, 2016, when Akhilesh put out his own list of 235 candidates for the 2017 Assembly polls, including many who did not figure in the list issued by Mulayam a day earlier.
The following day, Mulayam expelled Akhilesh from the party for six years on charges of “gross indiscipline”. Three days later, the SP national executive “unanimously” elected Akhilesh as the party’s national president.Advertisement

Amidst this churn in the SP, Seth became closer to Akhilesh and was even rewarded for his loyalty. He became the party’s national treasurer after Akhilesh took over as the party chief.
Seth was also said to have played a role in bringing the BSP and the SP together ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, when the two parties contested the polls together as part of a Mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) in UP.",politics
"Today in Politics: With Rahul and Tejashwi set to address a rally together in Bihar, what to watch out for","Last month, they could not come together on the stage of a political event because of the Enforcement Directorate (ED). But on Friday, as the Congress’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra prepares to enter Uttar Pradesh, its last major stop in Bihar will see Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi Yadav share the stage at a public rally.
The Congress MP and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader were scheduled to address a rally in Purnea on January 30 but Tejashwi could not make it there because the ED had questioned him for hours the day before. Now, the two leaders will address the rally in the village of Dhanechha in Kaimur district, scheduled to begin around 2.30 pm, and the message they send out will be closely observed.
With this rally, the INDIA alliance of Opposition parties will be looking for some clear political messaging after weeks of bad news. First, the bloc saw the exit of the Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (United) late last month, followed by the Rashtriya Lok Dal a couple of weeks later. Then, the seat-sharing talks with the Aam Aadmi Party came a cropper and now, creating another potential problem area for the Opposition bloc, the National Conference has said that it won’t budge from its position of contesting all three Lok Sabha seats in the Kashmir Valley. Meanwhile, there is no sign of a forward movement on seat-sharing talks in Maharashtra and in West Bengal the Trinamool Congress (TMC) has long opted out of any on-the-ground agreement, leaving the Congress and the Left to figure out their tie-up.Advertisement
Along with their line of attack against the BJP and the NDA, it has to be seen if Rahul and Tejashwi provide clarity on the status of seat sharing in Bihar — the two parties have been allies since 2014 — inject a sense of optimism in the INDIA grouping, and give it a sense of direction. With the BJP National Council meeting scheduled for the weekend, time is of the essence for the Opposition bloc, which has to resolve differences, agree on a strategy and seats, and start mobilising its workers.
Meanwhile, when the Congress yatra enters Chandauli district in UP in the evening, Rahul will be joined by AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, his sister, for the first time during the march.

A ‘Bharat Bandh’ call
As the deadlock continues between farmers and the Centre, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a coalition of farm unions that led the 2020-’21 protests, has called a “Bharat Bandh” on Friday citing a host of unmet demands of farmers, including a legal guarantee of minimum support price (MSP) for their crops. Rajasthan Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra has said the party will support the bandh call.

But with the SKM not leading the protests this time, its bandh call is unlikely to have a major effect. Like the Tikait brothers in 2020-’21, the two farmer leaders who have taken the lead this time are Kisan Mazdoor Morcha and Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee coordinator Sarwan Singh Pandher and SKM (non-political) convener Jagjit Singh Dallewal. Both of them were at the meeting with the Centre in Chandigarh that ended at 1.30 am. The two sides have decided to continue the dialogue and hold talks again from 6 pm on Sunday.Advertisement
Modi’s development push
On Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate and lay the foundation stones of development and infrastructure projects worth thousands of crores in Rajasthan and Haryana.
At 11 am, the PM will address the “Viksit Bharat, Viksit Rajasthan” programme via video conferencing. During the programme, he will unveil and launch development projects in Rajasthan worth more than Rs 17,000 crore. The projects are in crucial sectors such as roads, railways, solar energy, power transmission, drinking water, and petroleum and natural gas.
At around 1.15 pm, Modi will head to Rewari in Haryana to inaugurate and lay the foundation stones of projects worth more than Rs 9,750 crore in urban transport, health, rail, and tourism. Among the important ones the PM will launch are a Gurugram Metro Rail line, which will cost approximately Rs 5,450 crore, and the country’s 22nd AIIMS in Rewari. The AIIMS will be built for Rs 1,650 crore on 203 acres in the village of Majra Balkhi. It will have 750 beds, a medical college with 100 seats, a nursing college, and 25 superspecialty departments in the outpatient department. Its construction was announced in the 2019-’20 Union Budget.",politics
"Himachal: Amid rumblings in Congress over Abhishek Singhvi, BJP names candidate for lone RS seat","The Rajya Sabha election for the lone seat in Himachal Pradesh took an interesting turn Thursday with the BJP fielding a candidate, forcing a contest. A section of the Congress claimed there was a sense of resentment among some of its MLAs over the high command’s decision to field CWC member and senior lawyer Abhishek Singhvi, an outsider, as the candidate.
The opposition BJP quickly moved in fielding Harsh Mahajan, a former Congress veteran. Mahajan joined the BJP in 2022 ahead of the Assembly elections. He was then the working president of the Himachal Pradesh Congress. A former state minister, Mahajan is a three-time MLA. He is the son of former Himachal Assembly speaker and ex-Cabinet minister Des Raj Mahajan.
Sources in the Congress said the state party leadership was not in favour of fielding a candidate from outside, arguing that the state had rarely — in fact on only two occasions — had an outsider as Rajya Sabha MP. “The high command miscalculated and imposed an outsider… that is where the BJP saw the chink and opportunity. I am sure Singhvi will sail through but the party should not have fielded a person from outside the state,” a Congress leader said.Advertisement
In the Assembly, the ruling Congress has 40 members while the BJP has 25. There are three independents. “We will contest the election to win and I have also filed nomination for winning the seat,” Mahajan said.
The Himachal Congress had earlier urged Sonia Gandhi to contest. While Gandhi too was an outsider, there would not have been any divergence of opinion on her candidature given her stature. Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu called Mahajan a “symbolic leader” and asserted that the Congress has the majority in the Assembly.
On the other hand, former Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur expressed confidence in the victory of the BJP candidate as he claimed that a large number of Congress MLAs are “not feeling comfortable” and hoped that they may exercise a “conscience vote”. Mahajan echoed this, saying Congress members are feeling “suffocated and sidelined”.
The BJP is hoping to exploit the outsider candidate issue to give a scare to the Congress.",politics
"10 seats, 11 candidates: In UP, RS poll heat rises as BJP, SP join numbers war","Uttar Pradesh is headed for the February 27 Rajya Sabha elections to fill the 10 seats that are falling vacant, with the two largest parties, the ruling BJP and the principal Opposition Samajwadi Party (SP), appearing to have enough members in the state Assembly to elect seven and three Rajya Sabha MPs, respectively.
However, with the BJP fielding its eighth candidate, the fight for the 10th Rajya Sabha seat in the state has become an interesting one, with both the BJP and the SP looking to edge out each other in the polls.
On Thursday, when the BJP’s Sanjay Seth filed his nomination for the Upper House polls, he became the party’s eighth candidate to do so.Advertisement
Must Read  | 24 of 28 new faces, BJP goes in for Rajya Sabha overhaul, signals what’s coming for LS polls
Seth was previously elected to the Rajya Sabha as an SP candidate in June 2016. He later switched to the BJP fold.
The BJP has also nominated former Union minister R P N Singh, ex-MP Chaudhary Tejveer Singh, state party general secretary Amarpal Maurya, former state minister Sangeeta Balwant, party spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi, former MLA Sadhna Singh and former Agra mayor Naveen Jain for the Upper House.
The SP’s Rajya Sabha list includes senior leader and actor Jaya Bachchan, Dalit leader Ramji Lal Suman and former state chief secretary Alok Ranjan.
If the BJP had not nominated an eighth candidate, the state would not have needed an election as all 10 candidates would have won unopposed. But with 11 candidates in the fray, the polls will take place to determine the 10 winners.Advertisement
How do numbers stack up?
Currently, the state has 399 MLAs with four seats in the Assembly being vacant. The Rajya Sabha MPs are elected by a system of proportional representation, according to which each candidate in UP will require at least 37 votes to win.
The BJP has 252 MLAs and its NDA allies account for 34 MLAs – 13 from the Apna Dal, nine from the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), six each from the NISHAD Party and the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP). The Jansatta Dal Loktantrik, which has two MLAs and is headed by strongman politician Raja Bhaiya, is also expected to vote in favour of the BJP.
If the BJP manages to get all the 36 votes from these parties, its total number of votes will reach 288. However, for its eight candidates to get elected, the BJP will need 296 votes (37 multiplied by 8). As things stand, the BJP will fall short by eight votes.
If the two Congress MLAs vote for the SP candidates, taking the SP’s tally to 110, the latter will still fall short by one vote to reach the required 111 votes (37 multiplied by 3) to get its three candidates elected.Advertisement
Compounding the SP’s troubles, Pallavi Patel, the leader of the Apna Dal (Kamervadi) faction and its MLA, has said she will not vote in the elections, citing the Akhilesh Yadav-led party’s “negligence of the PDA” – Pichde (backwards), Dalits and Alpasankhyak (minorities) communities. Akhilesh has raised the PDA pitch as part of the SP’s Lok Sabha campaign.
By fielding its eighth candidate in the fray, the BJP has put the SP in a position of disadvantage with cross voting likely to feature in the polls.
With the numbers stacked up the way they are, the Rajya Sabha polls for the 10 seats in UP are thus likely to see some drama, with the two contenders trying to outsmart each other just ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.",politics
"NC digs in heels on seat-sharing in J&K, Congress faces heat from another INDIA ally","The National Conference (NC) on Thursday said it would contest all three Lok Sabha seats in the Kashmir Valley and had “informally discussed” seat sharing with the Congress in the Jammu region.
“We have no connection with the NDA,” NC vice-president Omar Abdullah said. “Neither are we going to knock on their doors in the future nor are our doors open for them. Today, our focus is to stop the BJP and, for this, we have informally discussed seat-sharing with the Congress.”
Omar’s clarification that his party continues to be a part of the INDIA alliance came after his father and NC president Farooq Abdullah said, “As far as seat-sharing is concerned, I want to make one thing clear, the National Conference will contest on its own.”Advertisement
Apart from being a part of the INDIA bloc nationally, the NC is also a member of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) in J&K. The Mehbooba Mufti-led Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the other INDIA and PAGD party with a strong presence in the Valley, in its response emphasised that “responsible political parties” should “rise above their differences and profit-loss analysis”.
The NC’s position rules out a seat-sharing agreement in the Valley while leaving discussions open for the Jammu, Udhampur, and Ladakh parliamentary seats. The PDP has minimal presence in the Jammu region and has no presence in Ladakh. Of the five parliamentary constituencies in J&K, the NC holds all three in the Valley currently, while the two in Jammu are with the BJP, along with Ladakh. NC leaders, including Omar, are of the view that only the seats currently not with the party should be up for discussion. Of the Valley seats, only Anantnag in south Kashmir has previously been a PDP stronghold and was represented by Mufti.
PDP chief spokesperson Suhail Bukhari told The Indian Express that given the political situation in the country, “any responsible political party is expected to stay united to deal with this onslaught”. He said, “We have always been committed to the idea that we all have to leave aside political differences and gains and losses should not count when it comes to benefits to people. That is also what the people expect of us. This is why Mehbooba ji became the anchor of the PAGD. Our party’s core group me recently and we decided that we will support and facilitate unity, even if it comes at a political cost for us.”
Asked about the NC position on seat-sharing, Bukhari said, “Now that they have publicly announced their decision, we will now sit and discuss a way forward. The bottom line remains that people’s aspirations and their issues require responsible political parties to rise above their differences and a profit-loss analysis.”Advertisement
Reacting to the latest possible tremors in the INDIA alliance, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh said that “different parties have different compulsions, but I have the firm belief that both the NC and the PDP have been part of the INDIA alliance and will continue to be so”.
Both the NC and PDP have been holding internal discussions on candidates for the past few months. This includes deliberations within the PDP for the Srinagar seat that Farooq Abdullah currently represents. The NC, meanwhile, has been considering fielding a new candidate for the Baramulla seat in north Kashmir since its current MP Mohammad Akbar Lone has some health concerns. People’s Conference chairperson Sajad Lone is likely to contest from Baramulla this time.
After the collapse of its coalition government with the BJP in 2018, the PDP lost all three Valley seats in 2019, including Anantnag, where Mufti lost to the NC’s Hasnain Masoodi, a first-time MP. This time, the PDP had been pushing the NC to contest Srinagar and Baramulla and leave Anantnag for it.",politics
"Electoral bonds order: BJP says its only aim was ‘transparency’, believes won’t influence polls","Reacting to the Supreme Court order striking down the electoral bonds scheme, the BJP said the Centre was only attempting to move towards greater transparency in political funding.
“This decision was undertaken with the laudable objective of transparency in electoral funding and reducing cash influence… Those who give donations say it is good if some secrecy is maintained. This isn’t unnatural. If another government comes, it could go after them. So, if someone is honestly doing business, we thought let them do so,” BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said, addressing a press conference at the party headquarters.
Off the record, party leaders said that while the Supreme Court order scrapping the electoral bonds scheme was a setback, particularly “a moral one”, the BJP did not expect it to have much of an impact on the ground.Advertisement
The Opposition may use the revelations of donors and recipients which will come out now as ammunition to attack the government, BJP leaders said, particularly if some of the donors were found to be corporates seen as having gained unduly under the Modi government or to be involved in irregularities.
However, the BJP believes that in public perception, it might not skew the scales too much as the world of political funding has always been opaque, and ruling parties have always benefited more. “The verdict will not have any major impact on the electorate nor will it hit our resources badly. But certainly, the Opposition would use it to attack the government,” a senior BJP leader and MP said.
At the press conference, Prasad stressed that the electoral bonds scheme was part of attempts “to make the electoral process transparent”. Listing the introduction of voter ID cards with photos and EVMs, he said: “The state where I come from (Bihar) once saw people die in poll violence, but that is a thing of the past now. This (electoral bonds) was another attempt.”
The BJP was reading the judgment, delivered by a Constitution Bench and running into hundreds of pages, carefully and would come out with a detailed response later, Prasad said, adding that the party respected the Court.Advertisement

Instead, he took a swipe at the Opposition, particularly the Congress, saying the BJP did not need any lessons from it. “As for the Congress, those whose DNA is made of corruption and bribery, please don’t make such allegations against the BJP. And as for (talk of a) level-playing field, the question is whether you are in the field or outside it?” Prasad said, alluding to the Congress’s shrinking political footprint.
“If you are outside it, whom does the level-playing field refer to? People decide whether you are in the field. Those whom the people have expelled from the field talk about a level-playing field. There are those who don’t get a single seat in regions they were once influential… you know whom I am referring to,” he said.
BJP national vice-president Baijayant Jay Panda posted that the scheme was “infinitely better” than what it replaced – “suitcases of illicit cash”. Alleging that often the cash could be traced to drugs and arms smuggling, Panda wrote on X: “Bonds addressed the issue of legitimacy (all donors are registered entities under high levels of regulatory scrutiny). While wanting even higher levels of traceability may be desirable, donors were skittish, making it impractical.”

In a swipe at the Opposition, Panda added that the data on bonds “demonstrates comprehensively that no party has faced discrimination, including & especially those who have seen a drastic reduction in public support”. He regretted that “the perfect has become the enemy of the good” and “the baby has been thrown out along with the bath water”.Advertisement
The electoral bonds data shows that the gap between the BJP and other parties is stark. In the first financial year from when the electoral bonds were introduced, 2018-19, till 2022-23, the BJP got 46% of its income from electoral bonds, as per the annual audit report submitted by it to the Election Commission. Altogether, 55% of the total electoral bonds sold in this period went to the BJP.
A senior leader said: “An avenue was created, and used. Jo dene wala hain woh denge, aur jo lene wale hain woh lenge (Those who want to give, they will give; and those who are the recipient, will receive)… The optics is bad, but the issue won’t snowball into something as big as to influence votes.”
The BJP is also set to argue that the Supreme Court verdict would bring back the practice of donations through cheque. “It will promote the practice by some parties of diverting funds to NGOs, which hire party employees as staff and then act as their agents,” a leader said.
Senior leaders ruled out the BJP taking the ordinance route, pointing to the difficulty of this given that the general elections are just weeks away. “Moreover, the court has declared the changes made to the law to effect the electoral bonds scheme as ‘unconstitutional’. It makes the government’s options lesser and tougher,” said a Union minister.Advertisement
In the next few days, the government is expected to discuss the judgment with legal experts thoroughly to explore the options available.",politics
"Electoral bonds order: Among petitioners, Congress woman leader who wields PILs ‘to ensure justice’","One of the petitioners in the electoral bonds case, Congress leader and dental doctor Jaya Thakur dons many hats. If she regularly uploads dental care videos on her YouTube channel, the general secretary of the Madhya Pradesh Mahila Congress also keeps filing PILs in the Supreme Court, into issues ranging from allegations against the Adani Group to availability of sanitary pads for school students.
Thakur was a co-petitioner in the appeal seeking quashing of the electoral bonds scheme along with the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) and CPI(M). A five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court Thursday scrapped the scheme.

Fresh off the win, Thakur told The Indian Express that she decided to get involved as she felt the scheme was “harmful for democracy. “The electoral bonds scheme was not a transparent system… It could directly influence decisions taken by the government,” she said.Advertisement
Having done dentistry from Bhopal, Thakur veered towards politics after marriage to Damoh-based Supreme Court lawyer Varun Thakur. “I was working in the field of girl education. My friends suggested I should join politics to bring about real change. Politics was a better platform to help people,” she says.

However, more than the political field, it is in the courtroom that Thakur has made an impact, through multiple appeals in a range of cases.
In 2022, she moved the Supreme Court challenging the extension of tenure granted to the Director of the Enforcement Directorate (ED), Sanjay Kumar Mishra, saying repeated extensions destroy democratic processes in the country. The same year, she filed a review petition in the Supreme Court against its order upholding the Centre’s decision to provide 10% reservation to economically weaker sections (EWS).
Following the release of the Hindenburg Research report on the Adani Group in 2023, Thakur urged the Supreme Court to set up a probe into the group and its associates, alleging they have swindled investors and the exchequer of lakhs of crores.Advertisement
She also moved a PIL in the Supreme Court seeking that states and Union Territories ensure availability of free sanitary pads to every female child studying between Classes 6 and 12; and separate toilets for women in all government-aided and residential schools. In 2023, on her petition, the Supreme Court directed states to ensure the “availability of vending machines disbursing low-cost sanitary pads in all schools”.
Later, soon after the Centre enacted the law providing 33% reservation to women in Parliament and state Assemblies, she filed a plea before the Supreme Court seeking directions to ensure its immediate implementation.
She has even taken leaders of her own party to court, as in 2019, when she levelled allegations against former Congress leader Govind Singh Rajput of illegal mining, while he was serving as a minister under then Chief Minister Kamal Nath.
Regarding her spree of PILs, Thakur said: “I do this to ensure there is justice. Many political parties don’t take a stand. Sometimes, they are not allowed to take a stand… And the truth doesn’t come out.”Advertisement

At a time when leaders of both the Congress and the BJP were throwing red carpet welcomes to court Dhirendra Krishna Shastri, the chief priest of Bageshwar Dham who routinely gives calls for a Hindu Rashtra, Thakur took on the controversial religious leader, alleging that Shastri had used unparliamentary language to describe and promote superstition, and called for an investigation against him.
Speaking about one of her pet issues, the condition of women in MP, Thakur says the state should focus on equality instead of charity, taking a swipe at the BJP government’s flagship Ladli Behna Yojana that gives monthly handouts and is said to have played a big role in the party’s return to power in the recent Assembly elections.
“I don’t think these schemes brought any real change, or that charity can bring actual change. Women want their rights, not charity. You are not empowering them. They are not getting college admissions or jobs. There is no right of equality here in MP,” she says.",politics
Electoral bonds order: Opposition hopes for revival riding on corruption charge against govt,"The Supreme Court decision striking down the contentious electoral bond scheme of the government as unconstitutional has given the beleaguered opposition INDIA bloc – riven by internal dissension – an unexpected and much-needed political talking point, and an opportunity to aggressively add corruption to its armoury in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections.
The Supreme Court order has asked the State Bank of India (SBI), the only one authorised to issue electoral bonds, to submit the details of bonds purchased since April 12, 2019, to the Election Commission within three weeks. The poll watchdog has to make public the information by March 13, which is when the campaign for the Lok Sabha elections would be gathering pace.
The timing, therefore, is crucial for the Opposition parties, which hope to frame the issue as one of corruption – on which they find themselves at the receiving end, even while struggling to pin their Adani-Ambani charge on the BJP.Advertisement
Incidentally, at least three regional parties – the BJD, DMK and Trinamool Congress – have received almost all their funding through bonds, which virtually ensured anonymity of the donors till now. However, by sheer volume, the revelations regarding the BJP are expected to overpower the others.

Several Opposition leaders whom The Indian Express spoke to felt that while the larger issue of the citizens’ right to know is significant and hence the verdict is watershed, it is more of an academic debate on funding from a political point of view. Hence, they believe, the talking point should be on the quid pro quo aspect, and hope that the details of the donors and the recipient when revealed would prove a clincher.
Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who has been leading the party charge against the BJP on corruption, said after the Supreme Court verdict that the electoral bond scheme was another proof of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “corrupt policies”. The BJP “had made electoral bonds a medium for taking bribes and commission”, he said.

“The bond is the biggest scandal since Independence. Rs 5,000 crore se adhik ke bond… Kinse kya saude kiye gaye, unke badle main kya bond liye gaye hai (What deals were made with whom, what were the benefits sought in return), what concessions were given to Indian and foreign companies… nobody knows… Such a big scam has happened, and 95% of the bonds have gone to the BJP, helping them across the country. They are fighting elections, spending, indulging in horse-trading, they are doing everything… setting up offices in every district. They blocked funding to other parties… how will democracy survive?” former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said.Advertisement
The Congress held a press conference on the issue, with spokesperson Pawan Khera asking: “Now that the massive corrupt mechanism by the Modi government has been exposed by the Supreme Court itself, will the government send the ED to probe the electoral bond scam?”
Arguing that the electoral bonds scheme violated “every principle of equality, fairness, reasonableness and democracy”, former finance minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said: “The fact that the BJP cornered nearly 90% of the donations by corporates and high net worth individuals will be exposed now. Let the world know who gave money, when the money was given, and to which party it was given. The people will ask why the money was given to a political party.”
Other Opposition parties were as upbeat about the order, but focused more on transparency and restoration of a level-playing field. “The Supreme Court has rightly held that electoral bonds are unconstitutional. This will ensure a transparent electoral process and the integrity of the system. This judgment has restored democracy and the level playing field for all political parties. It has also ensured the common man’s faith in the system,” DMK chief and Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin said.
The Aam Aadmi Party said the decision was an important step in ensuring transparency in election funding.Advertisement
Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav posted on X that the verdict “is a welcome decision for the revival of democracy”. “This is an expose of the illegitimate policies of BJP. This decision is also a revelation of the BJP-corruption bond.”
The TDP, which is in talks with the BJP for an alliance in Andhra Pradesh, also welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision as “historic”, using it to ask the ruling YSRCP in the state to reveal details of the funds received by it through the scheme. TDP spokesperson Deepak Reddy said party chief N Chandrababu Naidu has been a vocal advocate of transparency and accountability in politics.
The CPI(M), which was one of the petitioners in the case, said it had always argued that the scheme legalizes corruption. “By this verdict, this unscrupulous scheme designed to finance the ruling party via anonymous corporate donors has been completely scrapped… It is essential now that reforms for political and electoral funding are introduced, to ensure transparency, clean funding and a level playing field,” the party said.",politics
Kapil Sibal interview: ‘Govt cannot set aside electoral bonds judgment with an Ordinance … No law can set aside an SC verdict’Premium Story,"Senior advocate and Rajya Sabha MP Kapil Sibal who led the argument for the petitioners in the Supreme Court case against the electoral bond scheme lays down the notable aspects of the judgment that struck down the scheme, why he thinks it is a scam, and if the Opposition should now make this its main election issue.
* What is your first reaction to the Supreme Court verdict striking down electoral bonds as unconstitutional?
It is a historic verdict. It tries to restore the concept of free and fair elections, which is the basic structure of the Constitution. It tries to bring about transparency in the electoral system, tries to bring about accountability, sets aside all the amendments that had been made by my late friend Arun Jaitley that were intended only to aggrandise the political party in power at the Centre, which is the BJP. In many senses, this is perhaps one of the most historic decisions this court has rendered.
Read  | SC strikes down electoral bonds scheme as ‘unconstitutional’: What grounds did the verdict rely upon?
* What are the striking aspects of the judgment in your view?
The first thing is they have held that the Right to Information under Article 19(1)(a) is fundamental to democracy. Relying upon the KS Puttaswamy and the other judgments, the Supreme Court has said a citizen has the right to know who contributed how much money to the political party in power. When you are contributing this kind of money through these bonds … obviously, the contributions are huge and there could be an element of quid pro quo and therefore the citizen has a right to at least have that information. So, in a sense, it is taking forward the concept underlying Article 19(1)(a), which is the right to information in the electoral process to ensure that there is a level playing field.Advertisement
The second is that the amendments protected the political party and the donors from income tax. It also protected the political party from disclosing or allowed the political party not to disclose the funding it had received through electoral bonds.
Read  | Supreme Court strikes down electoral bond scheme. Here are opinions of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justice Sanjiv Khanna
The third is that there was no limit to funding … Under the previous law, it was only 10% of the average profits of a company for the last three years that could be funded through the individuals concerned or the entities concerned to the political parties. That limit was removed so you could contribute as much as you wanted and even a loss-making company could continue (funding) under the electoral bond scheme. Even companies that were set up outside India, their Indian subsidiaries, they too could contribute. So, all those amendments have been set aside as violative of Article 14.
So, it is a great day for transparency, a great day for Right to Information, and a great day for ensuring free and fair elections. But at the same time, the Supreme Court also realised that this electoral bond scheme had nothing to do with elections. Because it is white money it could not be used for curbing black money and this goes only to one political party so that they can use this money for any expenses that they want, including toppling governments.
Remember, they used to take their MLAs from one city to another to ensure they were protected. Where is this money coming from? It came from these bonds. And during the elections, if you have paid for all the sites for advertisements, if you hired helicopters, hired all the planes, where did that money come from? From these bonds.Advertisement
Read  | Electoral bonds: What Govt, RBI, ECI said when the scheme was first proposed
So, it skewed the entire electoral process and it had nothing to do with black money because the use of black money is rampant … In fact, it represented a scheme through which the donors, the big industrialists, could bond with the political party in power. That is the bonding scheme. It had nothing to do with elections.
* You mentioned the word quid pro quo. Is there any evidence to suggest that there was or could be a quid pro quo?
How will we know at this point? Now, this information has to be given by the political party to the State Bank of India (SBI), which within three weeks of this judgment will give it to the Election Commission (EC). And within one week thereafter, the EC has to publish it on its website. Then, we will get to know the extent of the bonds given by the donors, who was the purchaser of the bond and to what extent it was given. And then once we know the purchasers of the bond we will know the kind of favours the purchasers have gotten because that will be available in the public domain.
So, we will know what the quid pro quo is. Then what we can do after that is a separate issue. But this information will be available and, of course, as you remember Modi ji (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) always asks, ‘Where are the scams of the BJP, where are those scandals of BJP?’ Most of them are still under the carpet because they ensured that none of these scams are investigated at any stage. But here is a scam that is out in the open. And perhaps the biggest scam in the history of India.
* So you are alleging that scams lie in the details of these electoral bonds that will come out.
The scheme itself is a scam. The Supreme Court has struck it down. There is no element of proportionality. There is no element of reasonableness. It is a scam without a doubt. Now, to what extent this scam was made on the basis of a quid pro quo is the next step but that is something that needs to be investigated. They will not investigate because you know the ED (Enforcement Directorate) and the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) under their direction. We will have to do it.Advertisement

* While the BJP has got the lion’s share of the contributions through electoral bonds, the Opposition parties too have got. They will also be affected.
Sure, they will be. At least that information will come out. And we also made clear that some of these big industrialists were funding all political parties.
* Many of the Opposition parties are in government in states.
That is right. They must be funding all political parties because they may have economic interests in each of those states.
* So, could they also face the heat?
Why not? The fact of the matter is that the heat will be faced mostly by the BJP because it is their scheme. It is not the scheme of the Opposition. So, why should they be facing the heat? They were using this scheme, which is now termed to be unconstitutional. The genesis of the scheme didn’t come from them.
* At least three regional parties — BJD, DMK and TMC — have got almost all their funding through electoral bonds. They will also be hit hard by the scrapping of the scheme.
Why not? If the BJP is hit, the others should also be hit. But the scheme was not brought by them. The BJP brought it.Advertisement
* What is the alternative funding model in your view now? Are you suggesting a new model?
The earlier law prevails. We are in the midst of an election … So let’s talk about it after the elections and a new government is put in place.
* Do you think the Opposition parties should now make this their main election issue?
It should be made a national issue. It is a great opportunity for all political parties in the Opposition to get together and fight the election on this basis.
* Will it have resonance among people? It is, after all, not a bread-and-butter issue.
People know that they have got Rs 5,000-6,000 crore like this. Do you think that the people are not going to respond? Of course, people are going to respond. People are quite aware.
* Do you apprehend the government coming out with some steps to negate the judgment?
They cannot. An Ordinance cannot set aside a judgment. No law can set aside a judgment. They can bring an Ordinance to put in place a new funding system. But not this.Advertisement
* Do you think the government will do that?
I don’t think so. Because this information will be available only by March 13. By that time, the model code of conduct will come in.",politics

We take a look at what political parties have said on on the scheme over the years:
BJP: Ushering in an ‘era of clean elections’
Since the introduction of the scheme in 2018, the BJP has pitched it as a transparent solution to a corrupt electoral process.Advertisement
When presenting the Union Budget for 2017-18, then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley proposed the scheme, “in an effort to cleanse the system of funding of political parties”. Jaitley argued the scheme would bring about greater “transparency and accountability in political funding while preventing future generation of black money”.
Must Read  | Supreme Court strikes down electoral bond scheme. Here are opinions of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justice Sanjiv Khanna
According to the scheme, a person could donate a maximum of Rs 2,000 in cash anonymously to a political party, and the political parties could then receive donations by cheque or in digital mode from their donors, who could purchase bonds from authorised banks. These bonds would be redeemable only in the designated account of a registered political party and within the prescribed time limit from the date of issuance, Jaitley said. Another provision was that every political party would have to file its return in accordance with the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961.
Amit Shah, the BJP president at the time, said electoral bonds underlined the government’s commitment to electoral reforms and curbing corruption. He said the scheme would usher in an “era of clean politics”.
Congress: ‘Perpetuates opacity’
The Congress has protested against the scheme since its introduction, arguing that electoral bonds were an exercise in “perpetuating opacity and electoral malpractice”. They had argued that all funds under the scheme would go to the ruling party.Advertisement
The Congress also dismissed the government’s narrative of this scheme being a measure of “electoral reform”, pointing to the clause allowing anonymity to donors.
Senior Congress leader Manish Tewari argued that while the donation was meant to be anonymous, it was easy for the government to obtain data from the State Bank of India — the only one authorised to sell the bonds — and find out which organisation purchased an electoral bond and which political party had encashed it.
Tewari said the Centre had made “government corruption official” and previous regulations on the influence of the rich on politics were no longer present. “Despite reservations expressed by the RBI and Election Commission, the government went ahead with the introduction of electoral bonds,” he said.
In November 2019, raising the issue in Parliament, the Congress demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi break his silence on the issue. Calling it a “big scam”, the party demanded a joint parliamentary committee inquiry into the “opaque” donations.Advertisement

Following this, Union minister Piyush Goyal said electoral bonds were a decisive factor in promoting transparent electoral funding. Saying that electoral bonds brought “accountability to the system”, Goyal quoted scams under the Congress regime — Bofors, 2G, Coalgate, among others — and said it was natural for a party to oppose a system “cleaning” elections “from the curse of black money”.
Goyal said there had been multiple rounds of consultation between the RBI and government, between the passing of the Finance Bill on March 31, 2017, and the notification of the scheme on January 2, 2018.
Four days after Congress raised the issue in Parliament, Modi said at a Republic TV summit, “These days election (electoral) bonds have become their favourite. Some people get abdominal pain if anything happens in a transparent manner to ensure a transparent system in the country.”
In February last year, at the All India Congress Committee (AICC) plenary in Raipur, the Congress reiterated its stand, saying the scheme was “fatally flawed” and “fully corrupt”. The party called for a contributory national election fund to which everyone could contribute.Advertisement
CPM at SC’s door
The Communist Party of India (Marxist) moved the Supreme Court in February 2018, challenging the Centre’s introduction of the scheme. The scheme, it said, “undermines democracy” and would “lead to greater political corruption”. It petitioned for the scheme to be scrapped",politics
Congress ally and Kerala MP lands in a soup over ‘surprise’ lunch with PM in Parliament,"A “surprise” lunch with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Parliament canteen in New Delhi last week, as the 17th Lok Sabha headed to a close, has landed Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) Kollam MP N K Premachandran in the middle of a slugfest in his home state of Kerala.
The ruling CPI(M)-led Kerala government is using the lunch, in which Premachandran was the only MP belonging to an INDIA bloc party present, to attack the Congress, saying Premachandran sharing a table with Modi a demonstration of “the Congress-BJP nexus”.
The RSP is an ally of the Congress in Kerala while it sides with the Left in West Bengal. All three parties – the CPI(M), RSP and Congress – are a part of the Opposition INDIA bloc.Advertisement
On Tuesday, CPI(M) trade union wing Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) held a march in Kollam demanding Premachandran’s resignation over the issue, with the lunch providing fresh fodder for the CPI(M) and Congress’s constant barbs at each other in Kerala, particularly over the BJP.
Sources said that the Kollam MP was one of eight parliamentarians — the other seven including 4 from the BJP; 1 from the TDP that is considering an alliance with the BJP; 1 of the BSP, that is equidistant from both the NDA and INDIA; and 1 of the BJD, which is friendly towards the BJP — who had received a call around 2.30 pm on February 7 from PM Modi, telling them: “Chaliye, aapko ek punishment dena hai (Let’s go, I have to deliver you a punishment today).”
Premachandran’s RSP was earlier part of the CPI(M)-led LDF and he won twice from Kollam under its banner, before shifting allegiance to the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. He retained the seat as a UDF candidate in the 2019 elections.
CPI(M) Central Committee member and LDF convener E P Jayarajan said Premachandran’s attendance at the lunch with Modi was proof of the UDF-BJP links. “The Kollam MP only extends support to those who have destroyed the secular fabric of India. He has joined hands with those who have destroyed mosques and madrasas in Uttarakhand,” he said, referring to the recent demolition of a mosque and madrasa in the state, leading to violence. Elamaram Kareem, CPI(M) Rajya Sabha MP, accused the PM of deliberately “arranging the lunch” and questioned why Premachandran was the only INDIA bloc MP invited. “What is his (Premachandran) eligibility to attend the lunch? Both the LDF and UDF speak against the BJP in Kerala. In such a scenario, a UDF MP sharing a table with Modi is a political mistake,” he said, suggesting that the BJP’s claim that it would win a Lok Sabha seat in Kerala could be an allusion to Kollam.Advertisement
Premachandran has also come under attack from the Indian National League, the lone Muslim outfit in the LDF, with its general secretary Kassim Irikkur questioning him breaking bread with the Hindutva-agenda party. “Premachandran’s agenda is to saffronise the UDF, and he was there to set the stage for an unholy alliance between the Congress and BJP,” Irikkur said.
Defending the lunch, the RSP leader has said the invitation was “totally unexpected” and came from the PM himself. “It was cordial, casual and did not involve politics. The CPI(M) is trying to project me as a Sangh Parivar man as it is eyeing the minority votes in the upcoming elections (which otherwise go to the Congress). I am sure this campaign will backfire,” Premachandran said.
The Kollam MP also reminded the CPI(M) that Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan hosted a dinner for Union minister Nitin Gadkari in Thiruvananthapuram recently. “Will they brand Vijayan as a Sangh Parivar agent over that dinner?” he questioned.
He went on to add that the lunch meeting at the Parliament canteen was hardly a secret, with other MPs nearby. “A CPI(M) MP from Tamil Nadu, P R Natarajan, even asked Modi for a photo, to which the PM agreed. Will the CPI(M) find fault in that too?” Premachandran said.Advertisement
The RSP MP also pointed out that right after the lunch, he had moved a substitute resolution against the White Paper on the Indian economy presented by the government. “I clearly spoke against the Modi government and its policies on minorities,” Premachandran said, adding that Kareem should rather explain why he chose to attend a state conference of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (an RSS affiliate) in Palakkad instead of attending Parliament on such a crucial day.
Incidentally, in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls as well, the CPI(M) in its campaign against Premachandran in Muslim-dominated areas had alleged that he would shift to the BJP after winning.
Premachandran’s party as well as the Congress have lent their support to the Kollam MP on the issue. Senior RSP leader Shibu Baby John also referred to Kareem “preferring the BMS programme over Parliament”.
Leader of the Opposition and Congress Paravur MLA V D Satheesan accused the CPI(M) of trying to communally polarise the state. “Both the BJP and CPI(M) are playing the communal card in the state. What is wrong with an MP attending a PM’s lunch? Even as we oppose the state government, we attend meetings convened by Vijayan,” he said.",politics
57% vs 10%: BJP vs Congress share in electoral bond funds,"In the six years since the electoral bonds scheme was introduced, more than half of the funds extended through bonds have gone to the BJP. The party, as per its declarations to the Election Commission, received Rs 6,565 crore via bonds between 2017 and 2023. The Congress was a distant second at Rs 1,123 crore.
The EC is yet to publish the annual reports of parties for the financial year 2023-24. But between March 2018 and January 2024, the collective amount of funds generated through sale of electoral bonds is Rs 16,518 crore.
The Supreme Court on Thursday held the changes made in the law to introduce the electoral bonds scheme as unconstitutional, in a unanimous verdict on a batch of pleas challenging the legal validity of the Centre’s scheme which allowed for anonymous funding to political parties.Advertisement

A five-judge Constitution Bench presided by Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud also directed that “the issuing bank shall herewith stop the issuance of electoral bonds” and asked the State Bank of India (SBI) to “submit details of the electoral bonds purchased since the interim order of the court dated April 12, 2019, till date to the Election Commission of India (ECI)”.
The bench, also comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna, B R Gavai, J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, said, “The deletion of the proviso to Section 182(1) of the Companies Act, permitting unlimited corporate funding to political parties is arbitrary and violative of Article 14”.
Under the scheme, notified by the Narendra Modi government on January 2, 2018, electoral bonds could be purchased by any citizen of India or entity incorporated or established in India. An individual can buy electoral bonds, either singly or jointly with other individuals. It was pitched as an alternative to cash donations and as a way to increase transparency in political funding.
An analysis of the annual audited account statements submitted by the parties to the EC puts the worth of the contributions via bonds to the BJP at Rs 6,565 crore, from 2017-2018 till 2022-2023.Advertisement
 Funds received through electoral bonds from 2017-18 to 2022-23
Regional parties in power in states are also big recipients of electoral bonds funds, with the Trinamool Congress that has been in government in West Bengal since 2011 declaring contributions worth Rs 1,093 crore over the years, putting it third after the BJP and Congress.
The ruling Biju Janata Dal in Odisha declared Rs 774 crore in electoral bonds between 2018-2019 and 2022-2023; the party that has ruled the state since 2000 did not declare any contributions via electoral bonds in the first year of the scheme.
The DMK, which is in power in Tamil Nadu since 2021, declared contributions of Rs 617 crore in three years from 2019-2020 to 2022-2023.
Since 2018-19, the Bharat Rashtra Samithi has received Rs 384 crore from electoral bonds, while the Telugu Desam Party got Rs 147 crore.Advertisement
The Aam Aadmi Party, which is in power in Delhi and Punjab and recently became a national party, declared receiving contributions of Rs 94 crore over the years in the category of “electoral bond/electoral trust”. There is no clarity on how much of that amount is via bonds alone.
The JD(U), which has been in power in Bihar for several years now, as head of different coalitions, declared a total of Rs 24 crore via electoral bonds from 2019-2020 to 2021-2022.
Among the non-ruling parties, the contribution received by the NCP via electoral bonds was among the highest, at Rs 64 crore.",politics
"As Sonia Gandhi vacates Raebareli, recent polls show Congress losing hold in seat","Former Congress president Sonia Gandhi, after four consecutive terms as the Raebareli MP, is vacating the seat to contest the Rajya Sabha polls from Rajasthan. The party has won the Congress bastion in all but three Lok Sabha elections since 1951, and given its association with the constituency, one name doing the rounds as the new candidate of the party from Raebareli is Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.
Before Sonia, former PM Indira Gandhi had won from Raebareli three times. The constituency also elected Indira’s husband and Congress leader Feroze Gandhi twice, in 1952 and 1957; while former PM Jawaharlal Nehru’s grandnephew Arun Nehru won from Raebareli in a 1980 bypoll and in 1984. In 1989 and 1991, Sheila Kaul, Jawaharlal Nehru’s sister-in-law, won from the seat. A member of the Nehru-Gandhi family has not contested the seat just twice, in 1962 and 1999.
The three times the Congress has lost Raebareli since Independence has been once in the post-Emergency elections, when Indira was defeated by the Janata Party’s Raj Narain, and in 1996 and 1998, when Indira’s cousins Vikram Kaul and Deepa Kaul lost to the BJP, and non-Congress coalition governments briefly came to power at the Centre.Advertisement
The Congress has also won by big margins from the seat, with its vote share less than a third in only 6 elections out of the 17 since the first Lok Sabha polls in 1951. The party has secured more than 50% of the votes eight times, including all four elections fought by Sonia. The Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson has also recorded the highest vote share won by a candidate from the seat, at 72.2% in 2009, the year the UPA government returned to power at the Centre.
 The Raebareli seat results were reflective of the Congress’s waning influence in Uttar Pradesh overall, with the party winning just 2 seats and 2.3% of the votes in 2022.
The Congress’s worst performance was in 1996 and 1998, when it got less than 10% of the votes. But it bounced back in 1999, when Satish Sharma, a Gandhi family loyalist close to Rajiv and Sonia, was elected.
While in the 2000s, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) were the Congress’s main rivals in Raebareli, since 2014, the BJP has been the runner-up, securing 21.1% of the votes in 2014 and improving to 38.7% in 2019. Between the SP and BSP, while only the latter fielded a Raebareli candidate in 2014, neither party contested the seat in 2019.
However, while the Lok Sabha seat has firmly remained with the Congress, the story has been different in its Assembly segments in recent times.Advertisement
In the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, the Congress did not just lose in all the 5 Assembly segments in the Raebareli constituency, it finished third in 4 of them, and fourth in 1. The SP won in 4 of these segments, and the BJP that had fielded a former Congress MLA won 1. Across the 5 segments, the Congress secured just 13.2% of the vote share, well behind the SP at 37.6% and the BJP at 29.8%.

The Raebareli seat results were reflective of the Congress’s waning influence in Uttar Pradesh overall, with the party winning just 2 seats and 2.3% of the votes in 2022.
In the 2017 Assembly polls, the Congress and BJP had each won 2 Assembly segments of the Raebareli Lok Sabha seat, while the SP had won 1. The Congress had then secured the highest vote share across all the segments, at 31.2%, followed by the BJP at 27.8%. But the Congress’s overall seat tally in UP in 2017 too was abysmal, at total 7, with 6.2% of the vote share.
In 2012, when the SP had come to power in UP, and the Modi wave was yet to begin, 4 of the 5 Raebareli segments had been won by the debutant Peace Party of India. While the SP had secured a combined 30.8% of the votes across the 5 segments, the Congress was the runner-up with 21.7%, while the BJP trailed at 3.1%. Despite the poor performance in Raebareli’s Assembly segments, the Congress had fared better overall in UP, winning 28 seats and 11.7% of the votes.",politics
"Behind TMC’s RS picks, Abhishek game plan, stepping up women outreach, national pitch","From RTI activist Saket Gokhale to journalist-author Sagarika Ghose – the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) has sought to pick prominent, articulate faces in touch with national politics to represent the party in the Rajya Sabha.
In the wake of its landslide victory in the West Bengal Assembly elections in 2021, the TMC’s national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, Mamata’s nephew, spelt out the party’s objective to fight the BJP at the national level.
The TMC has since projected its national aspirations through its choice of candidates for the Rajya Sabha too.Advertisement
The party inducted two high-profile Congress leaders – former Goa chief minister Luizinho Faleiro and former All India Mahila Congress president and Assam MP Sushmita Dev – into its fold and sent them to the Upper House.
Sushmita has been renominated by the party for the February 27 Rajya Sabha polls. Faleiro resigned from the TMC as well as his Rajya Sabha seat last year.
For the upcoming polls to the Upper House, the TMC has named Md Nadimul Haque, Mamata Bala Thakur and
Sagarika Ghose besides Sushmita Dev as its nominees. Following their election, the TMC would have five women MPs out of its total 13 members in the Rajya Sabha.Advertisement
The TMC’s list reflects its continuing push for enhancing women representation in public life. The party thus hopes to reach out to a larger section of women.
Thakur belongs to the electorally influential Matua community, who is the daughter-in-law of late Binapani Devi Thakur, former matriarch of the Matua Mahasangha, who was known as “Boro Maa (elder mother)”.
By nominating Thakur to the Rajya Sabha, the TMC has sought to increase legislative representation of the community, a crucial vote bank for both the TMC and the BJP, which has a strong presence in North 24 Parganas and Nadia districts.
The TMC’s bid to nominate Sagarika Ghose is in line with the party’s past nominations to figures from various non-political fields, such as ex-Union culture secretary Jawhar Sircar, Saket Gokhale. TV personality and quiz master Derek O’Brian, and social activist Samirul Islam.Advertisement
An author of several books, Sagarika has worked for prominent news publications such as The Times of India and The Indian Express, and the television media. Like Derek, she is likely to be the party’s voice in the national media.
A TMC leader said, “Our second-in-command Abhishek Banerjee’s idea is to ensure that our party’s representation in Rajya Sabha is pan-Indian while having those members who can fight BJP effectively.”
A TMC insider said, “Three retiring party MPs – Subhashish Chakraborty, Shantanu Sen and Abir Biswas – were denied Rajya Sabha renomination. They all are known to be close to Mamata Banerjee. Subhashish was the first election agent of Mamata. So, the move has made an impact among some senior party leaders.”
The TMC insider added, “However, our leadership saw that the party’s interest would be served better by replacing these three retiring members with women nominees. This time Abhishek’s strategy is behind the selection of our Rajya Sabha nominees. Obviously, Mamata gave her green signal to it.”",politics
"As BJD backs Vaishnaw for RS polls, buzz of ‘tacit pact’ with BJP in Odisha gains pace","With the ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) announcing support for his candidature, Union Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw’s path to a second term in the Rajya Sabha from Odisha is all but clear, even as the move has triggered fresh speculations of a “tacit understanding” between the BJP and BJD.
The move ahead of the upcoming simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly polls comes in the backdrop of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and MP Rahul Gandhi accusing the BJD and BJP of “running a partnership government in Odisha”.
Minutes after the BJP officially named Vaishnaw as its candidate, the BJD in a statement said it would support him “for the larger interest of the state’s railway and telecom development (Vaishnaw is the Minister for Railways and Communications)”. On Tuesday, the Naveen Patnaik-led BJD had announced two candidates for the February 27 Rajya Sabha polls despite having the numbers to win three seats.Advertisement
The ruling party had extended support to Vaishnaw in 2019 too, when the former IAS officer was seeking election to the Upper House for the first time. A last-minute call from Modi to Patnaik had helped him get elected unopposed.
BJD insiders say the BJP central leadership consulted Patnaik before announcing Vaishnaw’s candidature, and the BJD hence named only two candidates – former MLA Debashish Samantaray and Subhashis Khuntia.
A native of Jodhpur in Rajasthan, Vaishnaw’s name was also doing the rounds as the BJP’s Lok Sabha candidate for one of the seats in the state, considering his tenure as an Odisha-cadre civil servant, and his time in the state as the district collector of Balasore and Cuttack.
The BJD has 108 members in the 147-member Assembly as four of its MLAs have been expelled while one recently resigned. The BJP has 22 MLAs while the Congress has nine, and the CPI(M) one. The House has four Independents while one seat is vacant.Advertisement
Justifying his party’s support to the BJP nominee, a BJD leader said Odisha had received the highest ever allocation of over Rs 10,000 crore over the past two years for the development of the railway network in the state. “At least 58 railway stations are being developed. He (Vaishnaw) has also helped in the massive expansion of the telecom network in the state. Our support is to further accelerate this development,” he said.
In a statement, Vaishnaw thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for nominating him. “I am a disciplined member of the party. My party takes all decisions regarding my public life. I express my gratitude and thanks to the party leadership and the Prime Minister for giving me another chance to serve the people,” the Union minister said, upon his arrival in Bhubaneswar for filing the nomination. He also met BJP MLAs at the party state headquarters.
The BJD, by supporting Vaishnaw, seems to have outwitted the state BJP leadership, which is not too happy about an understanding with the BJD, while sending out a message about its proximity with the central leadership, particularly Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

Officially, the BJP state unit said the BJD’s support in the Rajya Sabha polls will have no bearing on the party’s preparation for the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls. The party’s state chief, Manmohan Samal, said the BJP will fight the polls alone and ruled out an alliance with the BJD.Advertisement
“Our party has never sought anyone’s support. If any party announces support for us, why would we deny it?… Our workers have geared up for a fight in 2024. We will fight on our own and there is no question of an understanding with any party,” he said.
The Congress stepped up its attack, accusing the BJD and BJP of joining hands to “loot” Odisha of its precious natural resources. “The people of Odisha voted for the BJD and were unaware that the government would have a secret understanding with the BJP. Both the parties have betrayed the people,” Odisha Congress president Sarat Pattanayak said.",politics
Today in Politics: Will farmers call off stir — all eyes on their talks with Centre; SC set for electoral bonds verdict,"Amid the protesting farmers’ march to Delhi, a team of three Union ministers is set to hold a meeting again with the farm leaders over their various demands on Thursday evening in Chandigarh.
The central government invited the farmer leaders for a third round of talks in a week after two such meetings organised on February 8 and 12 remained inconclusive, following which the agitating farmers took the decision to march to Delhi. As barricades come up around Delhi, guarding all borders, and with the farmers ready to step up their agitation, the outcome of the talks will be closely watched and analysed.
The offer for talks from the BJP-ruled Centre came when protesting farmers were at the Shambhu and Khanauri borders of Punjab and Haryana with their “Dilli Chalo” call to press for various demands, including a law on minimum support price (MSP) for crops as well as loan waivers.Advertisement
The farmer leaders said they would not make any fresh attempt to move towards Delhi till the third round of meeting is held, adding that the next course of action will be decided on the basis of the Centre’s proposals.
On Wednesday, over 40 farmers who had gathered at the Datta Singhwala-Khanauri border between Punjab and Haryana to make their way to the national capital received injuries after Haryana Police used rubber bullets, teargas and water cannons to disperse them. The border had also witnessed clashes between the Haryana Police and the farmers from Punjab for nearly two hours on Tuesday.
Sarwan Singh Pandher, the leader of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC), which is spearheading the agitation along with the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (Non-Political), and other farm leaders will meet Union Commerce and Industry, Consumer Affairs and Food & Public Distribution Minister Piyush Goyal, Agriculture and Farmer Welfare Minister Arjun Munda, and Minister of State (MoS) for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai for the talks.
Earlier in the day, Pandher told reporters that if there is an invitation for talks with the Centre, they would consider it. “We were ready for talks yesterday and we are ready for it even today,” he said.Advertisement
While the farmers continue to put pressure on the Narendra Modi-led BJP government, the Centre, which had earlier rolled back the three farm laws following the year-long farm agitation in 2020-21, seems to be less worried about the political impact of the protests this time around.
Liz Mathew and Vikas Pathak reported that the BJP leaders admitted that the farmer protests made for “bad optics” and could damage it in Punjab but said they were optimistic about “counter-polarisation” in the state along with Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh.
The BJP functionaries argued that the party would gradually “expose the illogicality of the demand for a law to guarantee MSP for all crops”. A BJP leader told The Indian Express that “there is no logic in making a demand for a law” when the Parliament session was over and the Lok Sabha was about to be dissolved.
Though the BJP says it is unperturbed, party leaders want to de-escalate the situation and not allow the farmers to block Delhi’s borders again. Munda said, “There may be some people there who do not want a solution but want to see it as a problem. So, I will ask farmers to be cautious of people who want to create an adverse atmosphere.”Advertisement
Meanwhile, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has cancelled the second leg of his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Jharkhand that was scheduled to resume on Wednesday in a possible bid to join the farmers’ protest. He is said to have reached Delhi and may take part in the farmers’ agitation.
Rahul has already voiced his support to the farmers. Taking to X, he has said that the Congress would provide legal guarantee for MSP of crops in the event of the party coming to power in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. “Today, providing MSP to every farmer is the need of the hour and this decision of Congress will also prove to be a milestone. This will change the lives of crores of farmer families of the country including the rural economy,” he also said.

मोदी, उनका प्रचारतंत्र और मित्र मीडिया गरीबों और किसानों के दुश्मन हैं।
जब बात भारत बनाने वालों के हित की आती है तो ‘सरकारी एक्सपर्ट्स’ को बजट की चिंता सताने लगती है, पर बात बजट की नहीं, नीयत की है।
उद्योगपति मित्रों के लाखों करोड़ों के ऋण और टैक्स माफी पर चुप, उन्हें जल, जंगल…

SC judgment on electoral bonds’ validity
The Supreme Court on Thursday is scheduled to pronounce its verdict on a batch of petitions challenging the validity of the Centre’s electoral bonds scheme.Advertisement
A five-judge Constitution Bench headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud had on November 2 last year reserved its verdict in the matter.
The scheme was notified by the government on January 2, 2018 and was pitched as an alternative to cash donations made to political parties.
The Opposition has been hitting out at the scheme since its introduction. The Congress has argued that electoral bonds were an exercise in “perpetuating opacity and electoral malpractice”, ensuring that all funds go to the ruling BJP.
The CPI(M) moved the apex court in February 2018, challenging the Centre’s introduction of this scheme. The scheme, it said, “undermines democracy” and “lead to greater political corruption”.Advertisement
PM Modi in Doha
After inaugurating the first temple in Abu Dhabi and holding talks with Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum on bilateral cooperation, PM Modi headed to Doha, Qatar, on Wednesday afternoon for his two-day visit.
PM Modi will hold talks with Qatari Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani and other officials of that country. The PM’s visit comes at a crucial time. Seven out of the eight former Indian Navy personnel, who were sentenced to death on charges of alleged espionage were released from Qatar’s custody and brought back to India on Monday.
The PM had met Al-Thani on the sidelines of the COP28 summit in Dubai on December 1. The two leaders had discussed bilateral partnership and the “well-being of the Indian community” living in Qatar — this was seen as a euphemism for discussing the situation regarding the eight former Indian Navy personnel on death row.
On Tuesday, speaking of his visit to Qatar, the PM had said: “India and Qatar enjoy historically close and friendly relations.” He added, “In recent years, our multifaceted ties have continued to deepen in all spheres including high level political exchanges, growing trade and investment between two countries, strengthening of our energy partnership, and cooperation in culture and education.”Advertisement
PM Modi’s tenure has been marked with strengthening of ties with the Middle East. His visit to the UAE in 2015 was the first by an Indian PM since 1981. This week’s visits are Modi’s seventh visit to the UAE and the second to Qatar.

RSS affiliate supports farmers’ demands on MSP but says against ‘violent agitation’,"The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), an RSS affiliate, has backed the farmers’ demand of “remunerative prices for crops” while saying it does not support the “violent agitation by some unions”.
“Movements in the name of farmers with political motives just ahead of the elections and the violence, chaotic environment, and loss of national property arising out of them only gives rise to negative perception of farmers in society. Farmers who are struggling to better their lives have to pay the price for this. Hence, the BKS does not support the violent agitation,” BKS’s Akhil Bharatiya Mahamantri Mohini Mohan Mishra said in a statement late on Tuesday.
Mishra went on to add that people are free to pursue their political ambitions but not at the cost of farmers. “We reiterate that remunerative prices based on the cost is the farmers’ right and they should get it,” he added.Advertisement
The BKS Mahamantri, speaking to The Indian Express, said the BKS avoids using the term MSP and roots for remunerative prices for farmers based on their input costs.
Interestingly, the BKS has earlier supported the idea of a law guaranteeing MSP to farmers, which is one of the top demands in the ongoing agitation. However, with Lok Sabha elections just round the corner, the RSS affiliate seems to have issued a calibrated response.
In September 2020, when the now-repealed farm laws were being introduced in the Rajya Sabha as Bills amid protests by farmers in Delhi, the BKS had opposed them in their “current form”. The RSS affiliate, in its suggestions to the government at the time, had stressed that traders must be mandated to buy produce from farmers at prices not less than the MSP.

“The Bills are yet to be discussed in the Rajya Sabha. We urge that they are sent to a Standing Committee so that there is adequate discussion. If MSP cannot be included in these Bills, the government should bring another law,” BKS General Secretary Dinesh Kulkarni had told The Indian Express.Advertisement
The BKS had, in letters to then Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, had also expressed doubts whether the government’s ordinance would ensure farmers get the right prices for their produce.
Again in September 2021, as farmers of West UP held a mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar, where they gave a call to defeat the BJP, the BKS said a country-wide protest would be launched demanding a law to ensure MSP for all farmers. It had also urged the government to take a “sympathetic view” of the farmers’ demands.
ALSO READ | Unlike 2020-21, why BJP is unruffled by farmers’ protests this time around
“MSP is an illusion as farmers in all parts of the country are not getting it. A new stringent law should be brought in to ensure farmers get remunerative prices for their produce,” BKS National President Badrinarayan Choudhary had said.
As the Congress promised “legal guarantee for MSP” for farmers if the INDIA bloc is voted to power, the BKS underlined the “political interests” behind the current agitation.Advertisement
“It hurts when some people with political intentions use the farmers’ shoulders to further their interests. The BKS believes farmers suffer the most when a political movement is carried out in their name. The movements in Delhi and Mandsaur are proof of this. BKS insists that election manoeuvres in the name of farmers must be stopped,” Mishra said",politics
"Sonia joins ‘outsiders’ taking Rajasthan route to Rajya Sabha in Congress; list carries Rahul, Kharge imprint","When Sonia Gandhi will walk into the Rajya Sabha as a member for the first time, she will encounter many familiar faces, among them at least nine MPs who were her Congress colleagues – some of them even considered part of Rahul Gandhi’s team – but switched to other parties over the last five years.
The Congress’s current strength in the 245-member Rajya Sabha is 30, which will remain the same after the February 27 elections, with the party hoping to win 10 seats amid an equal number of its retiring MPs.
Of the nine MPs – nearly one third of the Congress’s strength – who had quit the Congress in recent times, Sonia will find some alongside her on the Opposition benches and others sitting on the Treasury benches across the aisle.Advertisement
Among them would be Ashok Chavan, Jyotiraditya Scindia, R P N Singh, Milind Deora and Bhubaneswar Kalita on the BJP-led NDA’s side; and Priyanka Chaturvedi, Mausam Noor, Sushmita Dev and Kapil Sibal on the Opposition benches.
The Congress’s strength in the Upper House would remain the lowest in its history.
The choice of the grand old party’s 10 candidates for the Rajya Sabha show an interesting mix of accommodation of seniors and a visible imprint of the Gandhi family as also Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge. There was also an element of pushback from the state leadership as well as honouring of their wishes and caste balancing.
The highlight, of course, was Sonia’s decision to bid farewell to electoral politics just ahead of the Lok Sabha elections and take the Rajya Sabha route to remain in Parliament. Sonia, who is not in the pink of health, has been avoiding public engagements for some time except attending Parliament and the INDIA bloc’s meetings.Advertisement
Her decision to get elected to the Rajya Sabha from the lone seat the party can win in Rajasthan meant that the state unit will continue to have five of its six MPs from outside, which is not a happy situation for it. Other Congress MPs in the Upper House from the state are Randeep Surjewala, Pramod Tiwari, Mukul Wasnik and K C Venugopal. Only one of its MPs – Neeraj Dangi – is a local face.
The decision to field Abhishek Singhvi from the lone seat in Himachal Pradesh and Ajay Maken from Karnataka is an effort to accommodate the seniors. Apart from being a Congress Working Committee (CWC) member and national spokesperson, Singhvi handles most of the court cases related to the party and the Gandhi family and is indispensable in that sense. Maken is the All India Congress Committee (AICC) treasurer. Their nomination reflects the imprint of the family.
Kharge too had his way in securing a renomination for Syed Nasser Hussain, his close aide. The renomination given to G C Chandrasekhar, a Vokkaliga leader who is in the anti-Siddaramaiah camp and close to Home Minister G Parameshwara, adds another layer. In the choice of the three candidates from the state, the Chief Minister clearly had no say.
In Telangana, the party has brought back its veteran Renuka Chowdhury, who is close to both Gandhis and CM A Revanth Reddy. The second candidate Anil Kumar Yadav, a young leader, is a confidante of Reddy. An OBC leader, he is a former national general secretary of the Youth Congress.Advertisement
In Madhya Pradesh too, the party has chosen an OBC Yadav candidate – Ashok Singh – in line with Rahul’s OBC push. There were reports that ex-CM Kamal Nath wanted the ticket for himself. Sources said Meenakshi Natarajan, a Rahul camp follower, was in the reckoning till the last minute but there was strong opposition to her candidature from the state leaders, including Nath and Digvijaya Singh.
Ashok Singh is a party veteran affiliated to Nath, who had lost many electoral battles but had been a counter to Scindia when the latter had been in the Congress as both hail from the Gwalior region. He is the state Congress treasurer. While the party central leadership was not keen to give a Rajya Sabha berth to Nath, it accommodated his wish in the case of Singh.
The Congress’s move to nominate Dalit leader Chandrakant Handore from Maharashtra is also a bit of caste balancing. It is an attempt to reach out to the Dalit community besides making amends for a past fiasco. In 2022, Handore was the party’s first candidate for the state’s MLC elections. Despite being short of numbers on its own to get a second candidate elected, the Congress fielded Bhai Jagtap hoping to ensure his win with the help of its MVA allies. But in an anti-climax, Jagtap won and Handore – the first-choice candidate – lost due to cross-voting. The party is now making amends by bringing him to the Rajya Sabha.
The Congress’s candidate in Bihar – state party president Akhilesh Prasad Singh – is an obvious choice. He belongs to the upper caste Bhumihar community.",politics
"24 of 28 new faces, BJP goes in for Rajya Sabha overhaul, signals what’s coming for LS polls","The Rajya Sabha elections on February 27 may not change the BJP’s tally in the Upper House, but its look will be starkly different. Among the 28 names announced by the party – the same as the number of seats held by it currently – 24 are new, with only four repeated.
A total of 56 seats are falling vacant in this round of the biennial elections. The BJP can win 27 seats as per its numbers, plus 1 more with the help of the BJD in Odisha.
The four BJP leaders set to return to the Rajya Sabha include party president J P Nadda (an MP from Congress-ruled Himachal Pradesh, who has been nominated from Gujarat); senior minister Ashwini Vaishnaw (named from Odisha, where he will again need the ruling BJD’s support like last time); Union minister L Murugan (renominated from Madhya Pradesh); and senior BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi (Uttar Pradesh), whose name had been announced earlier.Advertisement
The BJP top leadership had made it clear earlier that it wanted senior names who had served several terms in the Rajya Sabha to contest the Lok Sabha elections. After the announcement of names on Wednesday, it is more or less clear that Union ministers Bhupender Yadav, Dharmendra Pradhan, Mansukh Mandaviya, Narayan Rane, Parshottam Rupala, V Muraleedharan and Rajeev Chandrasekhar will have to take the Lok Sabha route back to Parliament – unless they are moved to the organisation side.
The other Rajya Sabha MPs who haven’t received a renomination include BJP national media head Anil Baluni, BJP national vice-president Saroj Pandey, and former Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi.
Addressing NDA MPs in August, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that every Rajya Sabha MP should contest at least one election, so as to get a “feel” of the polls.
Sources said Modi also intends the Rajya Sabha MPs being put in the Lok Sabha battle to emerge as new political faces of the party in those states – be it Pradhan in Odisha, Muraleedharan in Kerala; Chandrasekhar in either Kerala or Karnataka; Mandaviya and Rupala in Gujarat; and Bhupender Yadav in either Rajasthan or Haryana.Advertisement
While Odisha is one state where the BJP sees immense potential to grow once BJD supremo Naveen Patnaik is out of the picture, in Kerala, it has been trying to make a breakthrough. Chandrasekhar, as Minister of State, Electronics and Information Technology, has emerged as a tech-savvy face of the BJP, fitting the template for both Kerala and Karnataka (he is a Malayali based in Bengaluru).
In Gujarat, the BJP wants to develop a strong second rung after Modi and Amit Shah have moved to the Centre, while in Rajasthan, it has been trying to grow out of Vasundhara Raje’s shadow. In Haryana, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar is still seen as a party man rather than a leader in his own right, as opposed to several titans in the Opposition ranks.
BJP sources said that Rajya Sabha MPs who find themselves contesting the general elections this time would be fielded from “safe seats”. Rupala’s name is doing the rounds for Amreli or Rajkot; Mandaviya’s for Bhavnagar or Porbandar or Surat; Bhupendra Yadav’s for either Alwar in Rajasthan or Bhiwani–Mahendragarh in Haryana; Saroj Pandey’s from Korba in Chhattisgarh; Baluni’s for Pauri Garhwal; and Muraleedharan from Attingal in Kerala.
Sources said the top leadership is making an exception for those senior ministers in the Rajya Sabha who are holding hectic portfolios, which might be a distraction for them in a Lok Sabha campaign. Hence, the Rajya Sabha nod for Vaishnaw, who holds the Railways and IT portfolios. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar may not be asked to contest Lok Sabha polls either.Advertisement
The distribution of Rajya Sabha tickets is also a reaffirmation of the strategy the BJP adopted in the recent Hindi heartland states – where it performed spectacularly – of rewarding those who have worked hard and long for the party.
Of the 28 candidates, five are women while the caste balance has also been kept in mind.
Apart from a new-look Rajya Sabha brigade, the BJP has effectively signalled that its Lok Sabha ranks too will have a number of fresh faces. This, though, will be done keeping winnability in mind, sources said, given Modi’s target of 370 seats for the BJP.
“Modiji’s new government also will be full of new faces,” predicted a senior party leader.Advertisement
As per sources, one of those faces could be Nadda, whose second term as party president ends in June.
Among the “outsiders” whom the BJP has given Rajya Sabha tickets include former Congress leader R P N Singh, who joined the BJP in January 2022 and has been waiting to be accommodated since. His name figured in the first list released by the BJP earlier this week.
Former Maharashtra chief minister and senior Congress leader Ashok Chavan, who joined the BJP only on Tuesday, has also got a Rajya Sabha nomination. “It shows the BJP’s wariness about alienating the sentiments of a prominent community (Marathas) on the eve of elections in the key state,” said a party leader from Maharashtra.
Sources said the BJP’s first list for the Lok Sabha may be released in the next few days once the senior leadership holds meetings.

"After Swami Maurya, SP’s Apna Dal ally speaks out over ‘sidelining’ of backwards","There is trouble brewing within the Samajwadi Party (SP), with dissenters using the latest round of rolling Rajya Sabha polls, due on February 27, as a platform to voice their disagreements with the party leadership. At least two prominent leaders of the party have questioned the SP’s “treatment” of backward leaders, with questions raised on why it had not stood by its own Lok Sabha poll promises regarding, what it calls, the PDA (Pichda, Dalit and Alpasankhyak) groups, while naming its Rajya Sabha candidates.
The first was party national general secretary Swami Prasad Maurya, who resigned from his post on Tuesday, claiming that he was being undermined within the party by other leaders who described his statements as his “personal views”.
Now Pallavi Patel, who won the Assembly seat from Sirathu in 2022 on the SP symbol, with her party Apna Dal (Kamervadi) as SP’s ally, has said she won’t cast her vote for the Rajya Sabha polls. The vote of the lone Apna Dal (K) leader could become crucial for the SP in getting all three of its nominees elected to the Rajya Sabha.Advertisement
Patel has objected to the fact that two of the three candidates nominated by the SP are not from PDA communities, and she suggested Wednesday that it was not certain that her party would continue as an SP ally.
SP sources claimed her real grievance was that her mother Krishna Patel wasn’t nominated. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, still recovering from the exit of ally RLD, asserted that there was no cause for worry.
The SP, which can win 3 of the 10 Rajya Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh that are falling vacant, has nominated former chief secretary Alok Ranjan, actor-turned-politician Jaya Bachchan — both Kayasths — and Ramji Lal Suman, a Dalit.
Other party leaders too said on Wednesday that there was a difference between what SP chief Akhilesh Yadav is preaching and what he does.Advertisement
“To vindicate his PDA pitch, he should have sent three PDA people to the Rajya Sabha. He has sent Jaya Bachchan ji, who is a reliable leader for the SP. But was it the right choice in an election year? The second choice — Alok Ranjan — has raised more eyebrows within the party. He is from an upper caste, has no grounding in politics. The party leadership could have chosen a woman from a marginalised community. Maybe a Muslim woman and a backward class leader…,” a Lucknow-based SP leader said.
Another SP leader said: “Look at what the BJP is doing. They have given Bharat Ratna to a farmer leader (Chaudhary Charan Singh) and a backward leader (Karpoori Thakur). This is all a part of their election strategy. Akhileshji and the top leadership could have also made the nominations a tactical move. The Muslims are a main vote bank for the SP now, but it seems they have no standing within the party.”
Speaking to reporters, Patel said: “There is no anger. But our slogan is PDA, irrespective of how strong a candidate might be. For example, Jaya Bachchanji may be accomplished, but she is not from the PDA… If the PDA is your slogan, and you have three seats, then give it to Muslims, backwards and Dalits.” She also asked why no Muslim figured in the SP list, while raising questions regarding the choice of Ranjan.
On whether her party would contest the Lok Sabha polls with the SP as a partner, Patel said the decision would be taken by her mother Krishna Patel, who is also the party chief.Advertisement
The other Apna Dal faction, led by Pallavi’s sister Anupriya Patel, is an ally of the BJP.
Akhilesh, who was on SP turf of Mainpuri Wednesday, played down the issue. Asked about Maurya’s resignation, the former CM said, “We will discuss the issue within the party and find a solution.” He added that what was more important was addressing the concerns of protesting farmers.
About Patel saying she would not vote in the Rajya Sabha polls, he said, “The BJP and its people are panicking over PDA. I hope our ally (Apna Dal-Kamervadi) will strengthen the fight for PDA. Several Rajya Sabha seats will fall vacant in the future. The PDA fight is not getting weakened due to one round of Rajya Sabha elections.”",politics
"Jagan’s 3-capital plan stuck, Andhra hems and haws ahead of June 2 deadline on Hyderabad","With the deadline for Hyderabad remaining the joint capital of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana set to expire on June 2, opinion in the ruling YSRCP in Andhra Pradesh appears divided, with key leaders speaking in different voices.
As per the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, Hyderabad was to be the joint capital of the two states for 10 years, from June 2014 till June 2, 2024, after which it would be the capital of Telangana alone, as the city is located inside its territory.
Must Read  | Special Category Status for Andhra: 5 years later, Jagan in Chandrababu Naidu’s shoes
On Tuesday, YSRCP MP Y V Subba Reddy, the former chairman of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) and a key aide of Andhra Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, said Hyderabad should continue as the joint capital until the state had a capital of its own. On Wednesday, however, senior minister Botsa Satyanarayana said it was not feasible to continue with Hyderabad as the joint capital beyond the deadline, a statement that is being seen as damage control by the ruling party.Advertisement
Subba Reddy, who is also the regional coordinator for North Andhra Pradesh, made the remarks at Visakhapatnam, while speaking about developing the city as Andhra’s administrative capital. Stressing that developing Visakhapatnam as the capital was prudent, as it is already a developed city and does not need a huge financial commitment, he said a section of the YSRCP believed Hyderabad should continue as the capital for some more time. Subba Reddy also pointed to the legal wrangles which had delayed the CM’s plans to have Visakhapatnam as the administrative capital.
Sources said Subba Reddy, who just received a Rajya Sabha nomination, was echoing the CM’s views. Jagan is believed to have deferred his Visakhapatnam plans as he is currently focused on winning the Assembly polls that are due along with the Lok Sabha elections in April or May this year. YSRCP leaders said Jagan may return to the issue only after the polls now.
Beyond Visakhapatnam as well, there is a rethink in the YSRCP leadership over Jagan’s ‘decentralised development plan’ — a key component of which was the setting up of three capitals, with Amaravati as the legislative capital, Kurnool as the judicial capital and Visakhapatnam as the administrative capital — which has been caught in legal troubles. Jagan reportedly wants Hyderabad to continue as the joint capital until the matter is resolved, or at least some secretariat offices in Visakhapatnam start functioning.
Seeking to put the YSCRP in a spot on the matter, the opposition TDP claimed ruling party leaders wanted to retain Hyderabad as Andhra capital due to the illegal assets they owned in the city. TDP state president K Atchen Naidu said Wednesday: “While some leaders of the party are talking of establishing decentralised capitals, their colleagues want Hyderabad to continue as the joint capital. Jagan destroyed Amaravati, the capital city announced by the TDP, but there is no progress in converting Visakhapatnam into the administrative capital. Actually, they don’t have any plans to build a capital city. The indecision is only because they have illegal assets and properties amassed in Hyderabad that they want to protect, and are also afraid of losing the coming elections,” Naidu said.Advertisement

Andhra BJP spokesperson L Dinkar accused the YSRCP of cheating people in the name of decentralised development. “Instead of completing the half-finished Amravati as the capital city, Jagan destroyed it, while promising three capitals. Now, he is backtracking on that too,” he said.
Satyanarayana’s remarks contradicting Subba Reddy’s views came soon after. “Now that the stipulated 10 years are over, the YSRCP does not think it is possible for Hyderabad to continue as the joint capital (of Andhra and Telangana). We will have our decentralised capitals soon, with Visakhapatnam as the administrative capital,” he said.
The issue of a capital for Andhra has now stretched over two governments. The TDP under CM N Chandrababu Naidu first began building Amaravati as the new capital during his 2014-2019 government. However, this came to a halt after he lost the May 2019 Assembly polls. Jagan put a halt to this, and so while Amaravati now hosts the new state’s legislature and executive branches, it is yet to formally designate a city as its capital.
Jagan was seen to have floated the idea of decentralised development only to override his arch rival’s project of making Amaravati the state capital. However, even without the legal troubles, the Jagan government has dragged its feet on the matter.",politics
Meet key faces of farm protest 2.0: A rebel and a lone warrior,"As the Punjab farmer groups again hit the roads in a bid to march to Delhi to hold protests over their various demands, running into massive security force contingents – who have put up multi-layer barricades and used lathicharge and teargas shells to stop them – two new farmer leaders have come under spotlight: Sarwan Singh Pandher, the coordinator of the Kisan Mazdoor Morcha (KMM) and the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC), and Jagjit Singh Dallewal, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (non-political) convener.
These two farmer leaders have been instrumental in their organisations’ call for “Dilli Chalo” to protest for a legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP) and loan waivers among other demands.

They were also the main representatives of the farmer unions when a group of Union Ministers, including Piyush Goyal and Arjun Munda, held two rounds of meetings with them in Chandigarh on February 8 and February 12, which remained inconclusive.Advertisement
Although the KMM and the SKM (non-political) are umbrella bodies of farm unions from across the country, the Dilli Chalo agitation mainly involves farmer groups from Punjab and Haryana.
Pandher is an Amritsar-based farmer whose union KMSC operates in 16 districts of Punjab. Although the KMSC was part of the farmers’ agitation against the now-repealed farm laws in 2020-21, it was even then charting its own path.
In 2020, when 32 farmer unions of Punjab had given a rail roko call from October 1, 2020 to protest against the farm laws, the KMSC had given a similar call from September 24.

Later, when other farmer unions withdrew the rail roko stir on November 22, 2020, the KMSC rolled it back only on November 26 when farmers had started marching towards Delhi. On December 11 that year, the KMSC set out towards Delhi with a convoy of over 3,000 tractors.Advertisement
On the Delhi borders then, the KMSC had set up its own separate stage at Kundli, even though most farmer unions of Punjab and several other states had formed the SKM to agitate under one platform at Singhu.
The KMSC was not part of the SKM, but it collaborated with them in various protests. Following the SKM’s tractor parade call, many farmers reached Red Fort on January 26, 2022 to hoist religious flags there.
Some KMSC leaders then took to Delhi’s ring road, but senior SKM leader Balbir Singh Rajewal still called them “traitors”. After the violence in Delhi, several KMSC members had been arrested, who were later released on bail.
After the year-long farmer movement was called off on December 9, 2021, the KMSC started holding its own programmes across Punjab, expanding its base across the state. From a group of 18 farm unions of North India in November 2023, the KMM under Pandher’s leadership grew to become a body of over 100 unions in January 2024.Advertisement
The SKM (non-political)’s coordinator Dallewal is a Faridkot-based farmer, who is also the president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Sidhupur) which operates in 19 districts of Punjab.
Only a few months ago, the KMM had started working in tandem with the SKM (non-political). They gave the Dilli Chalo call on January 2, 2024 in order to hold protest at Jantar Mantar, with both Dallewal and Pandher saying that they got a response form the central government only in early February.
The SKM (non-political) is an umbrella body of about 150 farm unions. It was formed in July 2022 by Dallewal along with several farmer leaders in protest against the SKM’s move to reinduct about 16 farm unions into its fold despite their plunge into the Punjab Assembly polls in February 2022 through their new outfit Samyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM).
In January this year, five farmer organisations under the leadership of Balbir Singh Rajewal also returned to the SKM, although Rajewal had floated the SSM besides contesting the polls.Advertisement
To forge unity in their ranks, the SKM held a few meetings with the KMSC leaders but these talks failed. On the other hand, Dallewal never responded to the SKM’s outreach.
The differences between the SKM and the bodies led by Pandher and Dallewal could be gauged from the point that the latter went ahead with their Delhi march even though the SKM gave a call for February 16 Grameen Bharat Bandh regarding similar demands.
On February 3, the SKM leaders said they would have nothing to do with the Dilli Chalo call of some farmer organisations. However, following the security personnel’s crackdown on the members of the KMM and the SKM (non-political) on Tuesday, the SKM condemned it while writing to PM Modi to immediately withdraw the security forces and protect the farmers’ right to protest besides addressing their demands.",politics
"As Governors walk out of Assemblies, what has SC said on their powers","Tamil Nadu Governor R N Ravi ending his customary address abruptly and walking out from the Assembly on Monday, and his Kerala counterpart Mohammad Arif Khan’s similar action a month ago, have once again brought the Constitutional role of Governors into focus.
The apex court has had multiple opportunities to explain and clarify the Governor’s Constitutional role, including in situations like in Tamil Nadu and Kerala where there is an alleged delay in taking action on Bills passed by the state Assemblies.
Article 163 of the Constitution states that the Governor is bound to exercise his functions only after the Council of Ministers and the Chief Minister of a state give their “aid and advice”, unless the Constitution specifically requires him / her to exercise discretion.Advertisement
One of the first cases where the Supreme Court focused on the Governor’s role was in 1994, after then Karnataka Governor P Venkatasubbaiah recommended President’s Rule in the state after 19 MLAs reportedly withdrew support to the S R Bommai government. The Manmohan Singh-led Congress government was in power at the time. He reasoned that Bommai no longer enjoyed a majority and no other party was capable of forming the government.
The Supreme Court, while hearing the case, held that a report with a “detailed factual foundation” to show that the “Constitutional machinery in the state has failed” must be submitted to the President. The report, the Court said, must be sent to the Council of Ministers and can be sent to the President only after it receives their approval, as the Governor was bound by their aid and advice.
The issue came up in the apex court again in 2016, after Arunachal Pradesh Governor Jyoti Prasad Rajkhowa unilaterally decided to advance the session of the Assembly by a month and listed a motion to remove Speaker Nabam Rebia following letters sent by 13 MLAs expressing “displeasure”.
Even as Article 173 of the Constitution grants the Governor the power to summon, prorogue (discontinue) or dissolve the Assembly, the Court held that this can be exercised only after consulting the Council of Ministers. By this time, the Modi government was in power at the Centre.Advertisement
In April 2020, the Supreme Court was once again asked to decide if the then Madhya Pradesh Governor Lalji Tandon was justified in ordering a floor test after he received information that 22 MLAs, including six ministers, had resigned.
The apex court, while upholding the power to call for a floor test, addressed the Governor’s role in state politics. “The authority of the governor is not one to be exercised in aid of a political dispensation which considers an elected government of the day to be a political opponent… To act contrary to this mandate would result in the realisation of the worst fears of the Constitutional framers who were cognisant that the office of the Governor could potentially derail democratically elected governments but nonetheless placed trust in future generations to ensure that government of the people, by the people and for the people would not be denuded by those who were designed to act as its sentinels,” it observed.
In November last year, the Punjab government moved the Supreme Court against Governor Banwari Lal Purohit alleging that he had refused to give his assent to four Bills passed by the Assembly. The Tamil Nadu and Kerala government also sought the apex court’s intervention on the issue.
The Supreme Court, observing that Article 200 of the Constitution requires the Governor to send the Bill back to the Assembly “as soon as possible” if it needs reconsideration, held that he or she cannot unduly delay assent to a Bill. It also held that the Constitution requires the Governor to “declare” his or her actions – giving assent, sending the Bill to the President for consideration or withholding assent while sending it back to the Assembly for reconsideration.",politics
"Jolt for Congress now from Assam, 2 MLAs, ‘extend support’ to BJP government","A FORTNIGHT after Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra passed through Assam, Congress working president in the state Kamalakhya Dey Purkayastha resigned from his post Wednesday, while “extending support” to the Himanta Biswa Sarma-led BJP government’s “developmental work”.
Congress Mangaldoi MLA Basanta Das also announced his support to Sarma and the Chief Minister met the two Congress leaders soon after and felicitated them.
Purkayastha, the Congress MLA from North Karimganj, wrote to Assam Congress president Bhupen Kumar Borah, saying he would “continue work only as a primary member of the Congress party”. Borah said he was awaiting further directions from the party high command on the matter.Advertisement
Speaking to the media, Puryakastha said Das and he had decided to support the BJP government for “the development of the Vidhan Sabha, the constituency, the state and the people of the state”.
“In the matter of the Chief Minister’s vision for upliftment (of the state), there is no politics… We will give our cooperation to the government so that there is no politics in the field of development,” he added, avoiding questions on whether his unusual announcement meant a move to the BJP.

Soon after meeting the two Congress leaders, Sarma heralded the move as a “new trend” and said there was “no real Opposition” in Assam. It will soon “become a state where all MLAs will support the state government and the Central government”, he added.
“It would be good if this happens in all the states because Modi is not the leader of a particular party but of the country… People are very happy with the kind of work that PM Modi is doing in Assam… I am sure that in minds and hearts, there is no Opposition in Assam. But, because of certain compulsions, they (leaders) are in the Opposition. Now, people are breaking that compulsion and coming closer to us,” Sarma told reporters.Advertisement
Earlier, in 2021, Raha Congress MLA Sashi Kanta Das had made a similar announcement to support the Sarma government. Subsequently, he was suspended by the Congress. A year later, the party had suspended South Karimganj MLA Siddique Ahmed for cross-voting in the Rajya Sabha polls.
On Wednesday, Sarma pointed to these earlier instances as examples of the “trend”. “The Congress has made a rule that their MLAs cannot go for any meetings called by ministers or any government meetings. If they cannot tell us their issues, what work can happen?”
The CM added: “In the past few days, six-seven MLAs have reached out to me. More MLAs want to do this. Slowly, as and when things mature, we will bring them before you. There should be a positive atmosphere in the Assembly.”
The resignations come amidst the Budget session of the Assam Assembly. On Monday, Purkayastha had even engaged in a war of words with Sarma on the floor of the Assembly over the NRC process. Purkayastha had argued that lakhs of people in the state were unable to get their Aadhaar registration because of the freezing of biometrics.Advertisement
A leader from the primarily Bengali-speaking Barak Valley, which sees itself as the main target of the NRC exercise, Purkayastha is a three-time MLA from Karimganj North. He was appointed working president of the Congress’s state unit in 2021. That same year, he was also elected as deputy chief whip of the Congress Legislature Party.
Congress leaders attributed his U-turn to “pressure” from the government. Last year, a team of the Assam Vigilance Cell had conducted a raid at Purkayastha’s residence over alleged irregularities in the purchase of a tea garden.
“Some financial matters of his were being investigated and, the allegations may be true or false, but he was under pressure. The CM himself admitted that Opposition MLAs cannot get work done because he gives more patronage to MLAs supporting the ruling party,” said Congress Legislature Party leader Debabrata Saikia.
Das, also a three time MLA, had been a minister with multiple portfolios in the Tarun Gogoi-led Congress government of 2011-16.Advertisement
The move by the two MLAs follows reports of discontent within members of the party state unit, including Das, over the route selected for the Assam leg of Rahul’s Yatra in January.
The MLAs’ emphasis on remaining with the Congress is an added complication for the party. It currently has 27 MLAs in the 126-member Assembly, with disqualification proceedings against three among them — Sashi Kanta Das, Siddique Ahmed and Sherman Ali Ahmed– initiated by the Congress Legislature Party still pending with the Speaker.",politics
Congress RS name for Maharashtra is Dalit leader let down by own partymen in 2022 Council polls,"BY NOMINATING Chandrakant Handore as its candidate from Maharashtra for the Rajya Sabha elections, the Congress is not only attempting to reach out to the Dalit community, but also trying to make amends for June 2022 Legislative Council election fiasco, when Handore had lost despite requisite numbers on the Congress’s side.
The election had set off a chain of events leading to the eventual collapse of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government after Eknath Shinde’s revolt.
A Nashik native, 67-year-old Handore began his political career as a Dalit activist and was associated with the Republican Party of India. In 1985, he became a corporator in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and subsequently served as the mayor of Mumbai in 1992-93, at a time when the city saw its worst communal violence after the Babri Masjid demolition.Advertisement
Handore made headlines when, in the midst of the riots in January 1993, Yuvraj Mohite, a reporter accompanying him to the residence of then Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray, claimed he overheard orders given to Sena cadre to attack Muslims during the riots.
Also read | Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole interview: ‘None of our MLAs willfully wants to join BJP. It wants to pressure our leaders and drag them’
Mohite’s deposition before the Srikrishna Commission, set up to investigate the Mumbai riots, was instrumental in the commission making its judgment about the alleged involvement of Thackeray and the Shiv Sena in the riots. While Mohite gave testimony before the commission, Handore did not.
Handore went on to join the Congress, winning the 2004 Assembly elections from Chembur, and was made a Cabinet minister in the Vilasrao Deshmukh-government. He was reelected in 2009 but was dropped from the state Cabinet. He contested from Chembur again in 2014 and 2019, but lost both times to the Shiv Sena candidate. Despite his defeats, he held several posts in the Maharashtra and Mumbai units of the Congress.
On February 5, 2021, Handore was appointed as the working president of the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee. The party then fielded Handore in the Legislative Council polls in June 2022.Advertisement
While the Congress had numbers to elect only one candidate given its numbers in the Assembly, it fielded two, with Handore deemed as the first-choice candidate and Bhai Jagtap expected to face a tougher battle and needing to get votes from the party’s allies to win.
However, Jagtap had won instead, and Handore lost, giving rise to accusations that the Congress did not do enough to ensure the victory of its lone Dalit candidate. This was damaging to the party given Mumbai’s sizeable Dalit community and given that the BMC elections were expected any time – though they are still to be held.
Handore had blamed his defeat on cross-voting, and said he had warned the party high command about it. “People are angry… I was the Cabinet minister from 2004 to 2009 and did a lot for Dalits. Their sympathy is with me. This could have helped the party in the civic polls. Some people have stabbed me in the back,” he said.

Former Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam said at the time, “It is unfortunate that Handore, who supposedly got first preference, lost to a Congress candidate of second preference. This is very bad and, prima facie, looks like sabotage by our own people.”Advertisement
Later, when Mallikarjun Kharge reshuffled the Congress Working Committee after taking over as party president, Handore was named as a member. His nomination as a Rajya Sabha candidate now is part of the party’s continued efforts to make amends.
Six Rajya Sabha are falling vacant in Maharashtra. The BJP, with 104 MLAs, has the numbers to easily win 3, while the Ajit Pawar-led NCP and the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena have enough MLAs for 1 seat each. The Congress, with 42 MLAs, has the numbers to win the sixth seat, provided there is no cross voting.",politics
"Decode Politics: Why Manipur CM is calling for  deporting post-1961 settlers, raising NRC pitch","Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh’s recent statement that his government will “identify and deport” anyone who entered the state to settle after 1961 has come amid demographic concerns in some sections in the state. The Biren Singh-led BJP government has repeatedly linked the ongoing ethnic strife in the state to “uncontrolled illegal immigration” from the neighbouring country Myanmar.
Illegal immigration row
With the ethnic conflict between Meiteis and Kuki-Zomis raging in Manipur since May last year, the issue of “illegal immigration” across the Indo-Myanmar border has taken centre-stage in the state. The Biren government as well as a major section of the Meitei community have alleged that “large-scale illegal immigration” of the Chin people from Myanmar – who have the same ethnicity as Kuki-Zomis – into Manipur over the years has “disturbed” the “demographic balance” in the state, leading to the current volatile situation.
This month, the BJP-ruled central government has made two announcements which are in line with the Biren government’s demand to check this purported influx of immigrants. One, the Centre has proposed to construct a fence along the entire 1,643-km-long Indo-Myanmar border. And, secondly, it has decided to scrap the Free Movement Regime (FMR) between India and Myanmar.Advertisement

CM Biren has also been pressing for the implementation of a National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the state.
Biren Singh’s concerns
Speaking at an event in Manipur on Monday, the CM described the ongoing ethnic crisis as “a question of existence, identity and survival” for the state.
“The present generation is bearing the brunt of the failure of some visionless politicians and leaders. These leaders have altered the course of Manipur’s glorious past. Accordingly, the present generation today is insecure,” Biren claimed.
He said the Central government’s recent decisions were aimed at creating “a sense of security”, stressing that these measures coupled with the “deportation” of people who entered Manipur after 1961 will “secure” the state’s future generations.Advertisement
“Given the prevailing law and order, the Central government has rolled up its sleeves to give a sense of security to the people. The Centre has scrapped FMR and decided to fence the porous border. Anyone coming to the state after 1961, which is the base year for the Inner Line Permit (ILP) system, will be identified and deported, irrespective of caste or community. After this, the future of the next generation will be secured,” he said.

1961 as base year
In August 2022, the Manipur Assembly passed a private member resolution to establish an NRC in the state, following demands by both Naga and Meitei groups such as the United Naga Council and the COCOMI. The Biren government has since been calling for an NRC in Manipur.
In June 2022, the Biren Cabinet decided to adopt 1961 as the “base year” for determining the state’s “native residents” for implementation of the ILP – a system under which “outsiders” who are not permanent residents (indigenous people) of Manipur are required to get a government permit to enter the state.
The decision to make 1961 as the base year was made even though the groups leading the ILP demand – which the Centre extended to the state from January 1, 2020 following agitation — were pushing for 1951 as the base year.Advertisement
Read  | Explained: What NRC+CAA means to you
In 1950, the then ILP system had been revoked in the state, and these groups even claimed, in a bid to reinforce their demand for setting 1951 as the base year, that “around 10 lakh illegal immigrants” had entered Manipur between 1950 and 1961.
While the move to designate 1961 as the base year continues to be contested – changing it for an NRC to 1951 was one of the demands put by Meitei radical group Arambai Tenggol in the meeting it held with Meitei legislators at Imphal’s Kangla Fort last month – the demand for an NRC is being stepped up now. So far, Assam is the only state in India, where an NRC exercise has been undertaken.
Push for NRC
Last week, Manipur’s lone Rajya Sabha MP Sanajaoba Leishemba – who had also attended the Kangla Fort meeting – urged the Centre to implement a “full-fledged” NRC in Manipur with either 1961 or 1951 as the base year.
Speaking in the House during the Zero Hour, Sanajaoba claimed that the population growth in “some hill districts” in Manipur was “abnormally high” as compared to rest of the country.Advertisement
“It (NRC) is highly needed for socio-economic planning and demographic balance of the state,” he said, adding that the issue also “affects the population growth in valley districts because of huge migration from hill districts”.
“Some main factors of these abnormal population growth rates are: Number one, porous border fencing. Number two, access to FMR. Number three, negligence of security forces in guarding the border. Number four, uncertainty and turmoil in the neighbouring country. Number five, manipulation of census figures to take political advantage. Number six, immigration from neighbouring countries for various reasons etc,” the BJP MP said, adding that these factors are the cause of “many ethnic clashes in different parts of the North Eastern region”.
Stating that steps were being taken to address some of these concerns, Sanajaoba also said, “I urge the Union government to implement a full-fledged NRC in Manipur with a base year either of 1951 or 1961 at the earliest for safeguarding national security of our country.”",politics
"Jayant Chaudhary in NDA: More a loss for INDIA in UP, BJP already in commanding position","The Opposition INDIA alliance is facing yet another crisis. After the JD(U)’s exit from the bloc and the Congress’s stalled seat-sharing talks with the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the Uttar Pradesh-based Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) has now crossed over to the BJP-led NDA.
The alliance was officially confirmed by the parties on Monday, the birth anniversary of RLD founder Ajit Singh, but seemed inevitable after the BJP government led by Narendra Modi conferred the Bharat Ratna on party chief Jayant Chaudhary’s grandfather and former PM Chaudhary Charan Singh.
Earlier known as the Bharatiya Lok Dal, the RLD has had alliances with both Congress-led fronts and BJP-led fronts in the past, with Ajit Singh even serving as a Union minister under then PM Manmohan Singh. Its partnership with the SP is relatively recent, with the two parties first coming together in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.Advertisement

However, while the value of the RLD for all these parties has been its hold among the Jats and farmers in western UP, with Charan Singh also well-regarded in Haryana and Rajasthan, this has been on the decline since 2014 and the rise of the BJP under Modi.
Now, as the RLD moves to the NDA, it’s more a blow to the tottering INDIA bloc than a gain for the BJP, which is playing the long game. Plus, the RLD has been trying to secure more from both its ally SP in UP – making its displeasure evident after the party’s initial offer for the coming Lok Sabha polls – and is seen as carrying a grudge over the Congress offering it just 1 seat in the Rajasthan Assembly polls last year.
Jat population in western UP
In 13 of the 18 districts across western UP – Baghpat, Muzaffarnagar, Shamli, Meerut, Bijnor, Ghaziabad, Hapur, Bulandshahr, Mathura, Aligarh, Hathras, Agra and Moradabad – Jats account for a significant chunk of the population. In terms of polls, the Jats hold influence in about a dozen Lok Sabha constituencies and 40 Assembly seats in the region. They are estimated to make up 10-15% of the population in these districts, but are vocal as well as socially dominant, with the capacity to impact the political landscape. Mainly into cultivating sugarcane, they are considered the state’s richest farming community
Socially, Jats are categorised as OBCs in states such as UP, Rajasthan, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh, though they do not figure in the Central OBC list.Advertisement

How RLD has fared in LS polls
In the Lok Sabha polls, the RLD has been a minor player and has relied heavily on alliances. The most number of parliamentary seats it has contested in UP is 14, which was back in 1998. Its best tally has been 5, in 2009, when it was allied with the BJP. Apart from 2009, 2004 and 1999 were the only two Lok Sabha elections in which the RLD won any seats. Currently, the party’s sole member in Parliament is Jayant, who was elected to the Rajya Sabha in May 2023 as a joint SP-RLD candidate.
In 2009, the RLD had won Amroha, Baghpat (with the late Ajit Singh as its candidate), Bijnor, Hathras and Mathura (with Jayant as its candidate). In 2004, it had won Baghpat, Bijnor and Kairana; and in 1999, it had secured Baghpat and Kairana.
In 2014, when the RLD contested 8 seats in an alliance with the Congress, it failed to win any. The party’s candidates, in fact, finished fourth in all but 2 seats – Baghpat, where Ajit Singh came third, with 19.9% vote share, and Mathura, where Jayant was the runner-up with 22.7% vote share. Its vote share in other seats twas poor – 8.2% in Hathras, 5.9% in Bulandshahr, 3.8% in Kairana, 2.5% in Fatehpur Sikri, 2.3% in Bijnor and 0.9% in Amroha.Advertisement

The BJP comfortably won all the 8 seats contested by the RLD.
 Its vote share in other seats twas poor – 8.2% in Hathras, 5.9% in Bulandshahr, 3.8% in Kairana, 2.5% in Fatehpur Sikri, 2.3% in Bijnor and 0.9% in Amroha.
In the 2019 polls, when the RLD had an alliance with the SP and BSP, it contested from just 3 seats – Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat and Mathura. All three of its candidates, including Ajit and Jayant, finished runner-up behind the BJP. In Muzaffarnagar, Ajit secured 49.2% of the vote, just 0.4% votes shy of the winner, while Jayant won 48.5% of the votes in Baghpat, losing out by 1.8% of the votes. In Mathura, the BJP won comfortably with a 26.6% vote margin.
 In the 2019 polls, when the RLD had an alliance with the SP and BSP, it contested from just 3 seats – Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat and Mathura.
In terms of overall vote share in UP, the RLD secured 0.9% in 2014 and 1.7% in 2019.
How RLD has fared in Assembly polls 
In the 2022 Assembly polls, the SP and RLD fought as allies, after the BSP left the SP. The SP recorded one of its strongest performances since 2012, when it had come to power winning 111 of the 347 seats it contested, with the RLD also picking up 8 of the 33 seats in which it featured. The RLD’s overall vote share improved to 2.9% from 1.8% in 2017.Advertisement

In the 25 seats that the RLD lost, the BJP was by far the dominant party, winning all of them. The RLD was runner-up in 19 of those seats, third in 5 seats and fourth in 1 seat.
If these 2022 UP Assembly poll results were extrapolated to its Lok Sabha constituencies, each of which comprises five to six Assembly segments, the BJP would be overwhelmingly dominant here, with the RLD’s pockets of influence limited to a handful of seats.
The 33 Assembly segments the RLD contested are spread over 14 Lok Sabha constituencies. In these 14 seats, the RLD secured its highest combined vote share in 2022 in Baghpat’s Assembly segments at 44.3%, but still behind the BJP at 44.6%. The only other seats where it was the runner-up to the BJP were Bijnor, Bulandshahr and Muzaffarnagar. While the BJP got an outright majority of votes in 4 seats, its strong performance meant that its vote share exceeded the combined vote shares of the former SP-RLD-Congress combine in 8 seats. The seats where the INDIA bloc, if the RLD was still in it, could have outdone the BJP were Baghpat, Bijnor, Kairana, Muzaffarnagar, Nagina and Saharanpur. With the RLD out, an SP-Congress grouping may struggle in these seats.",politics
"In new company, Nitish Kumar’s new clothes — a lighter shade of ‘secularism’","IN AN exchange of words with his former deputy Tejashwi Yadav during the trust vote in the Bihar Assembly Monday, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar threw a taunt at the RJD that is being read as another sign of how far the JD(U) leader who once swore by secularism has travelled in the course of his flip-flops across the political spectrum.
Nitish, who accused the RJD of “minting lakhs of rupees” while the two were in power together, also accused the party of doing “too much Hindu-Muslim politics”, with an eye on the Muslim vote – which is not too different from the BJP’s charge against the RJD of “Muslim appeasement”.
Even though his series of political somersaults means that Nitish has frequently had to eat his words, this statement remains a first. In 2013, the JD(U) chief had parted ways with the BJP citing its “politics of communalism”, particularly making his displeasure evident towards its rising star Narendra Modi.
Must Read  | Easy win for Nitish govt in trust vote as 3 RJD MLAs, ‘missing’ JD(U) MLAs surface on his side
On Monday, speaking about its latest ally-turned-foe RJD, Nitish said in the Assembly: “Yeh baat karte the inke saath Muslim hain. Kitna Hindu-Muslim ka jhagda hota tha. Idhar hum aaye to Hindu-Muslim ka jhagda kam karte the (These people would say Muslims are with them. There were so many Hindu-Muslim clashes. It was when I took over as the CM that I controlled it).”Advertisement
While one reason could be Nitish clutching at explanations for his latest change of heart, with Tejashwi daring him to give a “valid reason”, the RJD seized on the significance of the JD(U) leader’s statement.
RJD national spokesperson Subodh Kunar Mehta told The Indian Express: “Nitish Kumar’s statement is a complete volte face of his stance. He looks to be appropriating the divisive politics of the BJP by trying to shift the blame on us. But his logic will not hold as everyone knows Lalu Prasad as the flag-bearer of secularism for having arrested BJP leader L K Advani (and halted his Rath Yatra for the Ram Temple) in 1990. Nitish knows that his vote base is fast shifting towards us, and he is looking for an alibi, at the cost of his core ideology of secularism.”
JD(U) national spokesperson K C Tyagi said Nitish’s statement should not be misconstrued. “The Bihar CM does not need an alibi or certificate on his secular credentials from anyone. His statement should be seen and judged in the context of the law and order breakdown under the Lalu-Rabri governments in Bihar, resulting in both communal and caste violence. The CM was only drawing a comparison. What is true is that under Nitish Kumar in the past 15 years, whether he has headed a government in partnership with the BJP or the RJD, there has not been any major communal violence.”
JD(U) national general secretary Aafaque Ahmad told The Indian Express: “It would be wrong to say there has been a shift in Nitish Kumar’s secular politics. His statement in the Vidhan Sabha should be seen in the context of only the law and order deterioration before 2005 (under the RJD).”
However, the JD(U) may find it hard to defend Nitish’s stance. During his earlier alliances with the BJP, when Nitish was the senior partner by far, he had ensured that any hint of communal tension was nipped in the bud.
Read  | Express View on political crossovers into BJP: One by one
Nitish’s former deputy and senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi recalled once how the CM would call him and his Cabinet colleague Nand Kishore Yadav in case there was any likelihood of communal tension to say riots should not be allowed to break out.Advertisement
In fact, when there was a spurt in communal incidents after his last split with the NDA in August 2022, the Nitish-led Mahagathbandhan government had cracked down immediately.
In March 2023, when there was a communal clash in Sasaram around Ram Navami, the state government had cancelled a scheduled programme by Union Home Minister Amit Shah as a precautionary measure.
The same month, Biharsharif saw the death of a person and the torching of an old library with a rich collection of Islamic literature during violence. Again, peace was ensured within a week.
The lone MLA of the AIMIM in Bihar, Akhtarul Imam, who stood with the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan during the trust motion, said after the vote that Nitish no longer stood for secularism in the state. “We have always fought against communal forces. We backed Mahagathbandhan to reinstate our faith in secularism,” Imam said.",politics
"Today in Politics: Sonia Gandhi to file RS poll nomination, INDIA alliance future hangs in the balance","With a day left for the deadline to submit nomination papers for the February 27 Rajya Sabha elections, the Congress is most likely to unveil the rest of its list on Wednesday.
As Manoj CG reported, Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi will stay on in Parliament but from the Upper House, representing Rajasthan. Sonia will be in Jaipur on Wednesday to file her nomination and is likely to be accompanied by her son and party MP Rahul Gandhi and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge. Her Raebareli Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh will most likely go to her daughter and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.
While this in a way will mark the end of a chapter for the party, it will be interesting to see who else finds space in the Congress list. Among those reported to be angling for a Rajya Sabha berth is former Madhya Pradesh Congress president Kamal Nath under whose leadership the party received a drubbing in the state elections in December. Of the 56 Rajya Sabha seats up for grabs, the Congress is expected to retain at least nine, including one from Madhya Pradesh.
No end to INDIA alliance’s troublesAdvertisement
In the larger scheme of things, the Rajya Sabha elections are unlikely to be at the top of the Congress’s priority list at the moment given that the future of the Opposition INDIA alliance looks bleaker by the day.
The political experiment that started in June 2023 has faltered in recent weeks with the exits of the JD(U) and the RLD, the refusal of Mamata Banerjee and Bhagwant Mann to agree to a seat-sharing pact with the Congress in West Bengal and Punjab, and now the AAP’s offer of just one seat to the grand old party in Delhi. The AAP also announced a candidate each from Goa, and that too from a Congress stronghold, and Gujarat.
In a biting comment, AAP general secretary for organisation Sandeep Pathak on Tuesday said that “if we go by merit, the Congress does not deserve even a single seat to be reserved for it (in Delhi)”. Ouch! The AAP leader also claimed that seat-sharing talks had not yet taken place for over a month.
In the past, the Delhi Congress has expressed its opposition to a tie-up with the AAP but in the past several months those voices of dissent receded to the background as the top leadership of the two parties engaged with each other. Now that the AAP seems to be out of patience, whether those voices in the Congress return to the foreground or whether the party’s high command steps in to salvage the situation will be among the political stories to track on Wednesday and the rest of the week.Advertisement
As things stand, at the moment a seat-sharing deal between INDIA parties is in place only in Tamil Nadu. But there, the tie-up between the DMK and the Congress precedes the coalition. Even in Maharashtra and Bihar, where there is a chance of a deal being worked out, the alliances in place precede the INDIA bloc. If the Congress and the Samajwadi Party (SP) reach an agreement, Uttar Pradesh will become the INDIA alliance’s first success story as far as a basic pact on constituencies is concerned. But even if there is an agreement in UP, questions are likely to be raised about what good the INDIA alliance experiment did if it could not help the Opposition parties break new ground in states where they had worked against each other earlier, and the Congress’s role in that failure.
What is happening in Odisha?
As the suspense continues over who the BJD will nominate for the third Rajya Sabha seat from Odisha, Union Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw is scheduled to arrive in Bhubaneswar on Wednesday on a two-day visit, reports PTI.
In 2019, though the BJP did not have the numbers in the Odisha Assembly, Vaishnaw went to the Rajya Sabha with the BJD’s backing after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah requested Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik for his party’s support. With Vaishnaw’s candidature now coming to an end, there is speculation about whether the two parties will again arrive at an understanding to send the Union Minister back to the Upper House of Parliament. The BJD has the numbers to fill all three seats but till now has nominated only three-time former MLA Debashish Samantaray and Subhasish Khuntia, its young face from Puri.",politics
"Unlike 2020-21, why BJP is unruffled by farmers’ protests this time around","The BJP was forced to do a U-turn in 2021 when the year-long farm protests at Delhi’s borders forced it to withdraw three contentious agricultural laws that had triggered the demonstrations. Though farmers from Punjab, UP, and Haryana are again on the march towards the national capital, the ruling party is not worried about its political impact.
BJP leaders admitted that the protests made for “bad optics” and could damage it in Punjab but said they were optimistic about “counter-polarisation” in the state along with Haryana and west Uttar Pradesh. BJP functionaries argued that the party would gradually “expose the illogicality of the demand for a law to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for all crops”.

“When Parliament session is over, the Lok Sabha is about to be dissolved, and elections are to be announced, there is no logic in making a demand for a law. It would have made sense had they protested after the new government was formed,” said a BJP leader. Another BJP insider said, “If some elements in the protest are wearing the mask of being farmers, they should remove it and state their real agenda.”Advertisement
Back during the 2020-’21 protests, the BJP leadership was nervous about the farm protests as it was worried about its impact in Uttar Pradesh ahead of the Assembly elections. Top BJP leaders assumed the demonstrations could adversely affect its Jat support base in west UP. At the time, the BJP top brass told leaders from Haryana, Punjab, and UP that “disaffection among Jats” could affect at least 40 Lok Sabha seats in these states.
This time, the BJP’s confidence about minimising the impact of the protests comes from the fact that the Jayant Chaudhary-led Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) has joined hands with it. “The Bharat Ratna for Chaudhary Charan Singh, the Jat patriarch, will also defuse anger among Jat farmers, if any. The party does not see a big potential in the current agitation to have a similar impact,” said a party leader from UP.

Though the BJP says it is unperturbed, party leaders want to de-escalate the situation and not allow the farmers to block Delhi’s borders again. Union Agriculture Minister Arjun Munda said, “There may be some people there who want not a solution but want to see it as a problem. So, I will ask farmers to be cautious of people who want to create an adverse atmosphere.”
Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij hinted that the Centre was willing to talk to farmers but suggested that their intention seemed to be something else. “They are saying that they want to talk to the Central government. The Central government is coming here to talk to them. It is beyond comprehension as to why they wish to go to Delhi. Maybe their intention is something else,” he said.Advertisement
A BJP leader said, “There are reports of talks going on between the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the BJP for the Lok Sabha polls. Such an alliance would have posted decent results in Punjab. Hence, this protest has perhaps been done with the hope that it paralyses the system. Since the epicentre of the farm agitation of 2021 was Punjab, Haryana, and west UP, there is an attempt to create the impression that these states are up in arms against the BJP.”

Hitting back at the Congress, which has targeted the ruling party over the farmers’ march, BJP Kisan Morcha president Rajkumar Chahar told The Indian Express, “The Modi government and the BJP have done more for farmers than anybody else … What has the Congress done?”
BJP campaign and Punjab unease
Sources in the BJP said the party would launch an intense campaign on “Opposition politics behind the protests”. The ruling party will reach out to eminent personalities and community leaders to convince voters that the demands are “illogical” because making MSP a legal guarantee will adversely affect farmers. Sources pointed out that no state government, including the AAP in Punjab, was ready to make it a legal guarantee.

But some leaders in Punjab admitted that the protests could hurt the party in the state, where it has struggled electorally. In 2020, the SAD walked out of the NDA over the now-repealed farm laws and contested the Punjab Assembly elections on its own in 2022. It won a record low of three seats in the 117-member Assembly, down from 15 in 2017. The BJP, which contested the elections in alliance with the Punjab Lok Congress of Captain Amarinder Singh, managed to bag just two seats, one less than its tally five years earlier.Advertisement
Another section of BJP leaders said the “politically motivated protests” might trigger “counter-polarisation”. They said that since Jat Sikhs were largely a part of the protests, other communities could consolidate against it. In Uttar Pradesh, when the Jats joined the 2020-’21 agitation, others, including Gujjars, threw their weight behind the BJP in the 2021 Assembly elections.

“Even in the two Lok Sabha constituencies where Sikhs constitute a significant portion of the population, Lakhimpur and Pilibhit, the BJP won all the Assembly seats. Because other communities felt that they were trying to bully the government,” said a BJP leader from UP.
A BJP leader from Haryana said, “Jats also end up voting in significant numbers for the BJP in the Lok Sabha. Else, how did Bhupender Singh Hooda and Deepender Singh Hooda lose? And sometimes, when the assertion for a protest comes from the dominant caste in a state, other castes get polarised against them because of their insecurities. So, the BJP will do well though it will want this protest to end soon and amicably.”",politics
"In fresh blow to INDIA, AAP ups ante in Goa, names LS candidate from Congress stronghold","In a setback to the Opposition INDIA alliance in Goa, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday announced its candidate for the South Goa constituency – a sitting seat of the Congress – for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.
Stung by the development, the Goa Cogress called the AAP’s move “unilateral and premature”, saying that the seat-sharing talks between the two INDIA allies were continuing.
Addressing a press conference, the AAP’s Goa unit president Amit Palekar announced that the party’s Benaulim MLA Capt. Venzy Viegas will be the candidate for the South Goa seat “on behalf of the INDIA alliance”, blaming Congress for the “delay” in finalising seat-sharing.Advertisement
Palekar said both the AAP and the Congress held various meetings on seat-sharing at the national level, but no formal meetings had taken place over the last one month. He sought to link the “delay” on the part of the Congress to Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra.
“The first meeting was held on January 8, followed by another meeting on January 12, but since then there has been no formal meeting. Time is of the essence…With less than two months to go for polls… delay can be harmful for campaigning and winning,” said Palekar.
“We can’t fight elections for the sake of just fighting. We want to fight to win and to defeat the BJP. So to that end and keeping in mind the ground realities, we have announced our candidate. We expect that he (Venzy) will be confirmed as the alliance candidate, as broader talks continue,” he said.
The state AAP chief also said they had been in touch with the state Congress leadership to discuss potential candidates, but “were given to understand that enough time was not being given to the local (Congress) leaders by their central leadership for decision making”.Advertisement
“We were told they (Congress leaders) are busy with the Yatra… In an alliance, we have to work in tandem and that confidence building was not happening as far as announcing candidates is concerned,” Palekar said, adding “The fact they (Congress) have a sitting MP from South Goa, they should have been more serious…Let us see if things change now.”
AAP leader Valmiki Naik claimed, “We (Congress and AAP) are alliance partners. This is not a pressure tactic of any sort. We are following the alliance dharma and going by the ground reality we believe Venzy has the best chance of winning from South Goa. Regarding the candidate for North Goa seat, the discussions with the Congress will continue. The alliance is going strong.”
In his reaction, Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) president Amit Patkar said, “I don’t know why the AAP Goa president took a premature press conference to announce Lok Sabha candidate, that too for South Goa which has a sitting Congress MP. INDIA leaders are in talks and a decision on contesting seats in various states will be taken by INDIA leaders in Delhi.”
South Goa, one of the two Lok Sabha seats in Goa, is currently represented by the Congress’s Francisco Sardinha.Advertisement
This has been a traditional stronghold of the Congress, although the party put up a poor performance in the belt in the 2022 Assembly polls.
In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, AAP candidate Elvis Gomes had finished third in the South Goa seat behind Sardinha and the runner-up from the BJP Narendra Sawaikar. The North Goa seat was won by BJP leader Shripad Naik.
In its first electoral foray into Goa, the AAP had drawn a blank in the 2017 Assembly elections. In 2020, the AAP won a zila panchayat seat in Benaulim. In the 2022 Assembly polls, the party won only two seats – Velim and Benaulim, both in South Goa – out of 40 as against the BJP’s 20 and the Congress’s 11.
Meanwhile, at the inauguration of the BJP’s election office in South Goa, Chief Minister Pramod Sawant took a swipe at the INDIA alliance, saying it has collapsed in the state.Advertisement
Earlier in the day, following the AAP’s Political Affairs Committee (PAC) meeting in Delhi, the party’s general secretary (organisation) Sandeep Pathak also announced its candidates from the Bharuch and Bhavnagar seats in Gujarat, offering just 1 seat out of 7 to the Congress in the national capital.
This came three days after AAP supremo and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal told a rally at Khanna that his party will contest all 13 seats in Punjab besides the Chandigarh seat on its own steam.
Last week, the AAP unilaterally announced its candidates from three Lok Sabha seats in Assam.",politics
Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole interview: ‘None of our MLAs willfully wants to join BJP. It wants to pressure our leaders and drag them’,"Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole addresses the charge by some quarters that Ashok Chavan and other departures from the party have happened due to him. Claiming that the Congress’s voter base has not shifted despite its leaders moving to other parties, Patole also asserted that the party will win the upcoming Lok Sabha polls in Maharashtra. Excerpts from an interview:
Why didn’t you try to stop Ashok Chavan from quitting the Congress?
Ashok Chavan was one of the most senior leaders of Maharashtra Congress. He was part of various committees and also headed some of them, including the one on seat-sharing arrangement. On Sunday, he was part of the core committee meeting and did not speak much. Even after that he waited to meet our in-charge. He neither told us nor the leadership about his problem. Had we known the problem, we would have certainly worked hard to stop him.
Are you the reason that he quit the party?Advertisement
Me? How? Did I stop him from working? Did I omit his name from any committee? Has he complained against me? No. I repeat, he was the senior most leader of our party and was part of every programme. I think one should not spend time on speculation. Let him give the reason. He has not yet given any reason… We do not want to get into whether he was pressured by Central agencies to switch sides.

What will be his role in the BJP?
He has leadership skills. But let me tell you, because I have some experience working with the BJP, he will soon be seen sitting on the third row at a press conference. It was said that (Union Home Minister) Amit Shah would come to induct him into the BJP. But what happened? A two-time Chief Minister was welcomed in the BJP by (Deputy CM Devendra) Fadnavis, (BJP Maharashtra chief Chandrashekhar) Bawankule and (BJP Mumbai unit chief Ashish) Shelar. That’s why I said at the press conference that he should rethink even now if he wants, and choose to come back to the Congress.
What will be Congress’s fate in Nanded after Chavan’s exit?Advertisement
We will win Nanded, even without Ashok Chavan. Ashok Chavan was big because of the Congress’s support base, and not the opposite. Today, we met corporators from the Nanded Municipal Corporation who came to tell us that they are not joining Chavan.

Is it true that a few more MLAs will join him?
We are in touch with all our MLAs. I cannot say about those who do not want to fight. But I can say for sure that none of the MLAs willfully want to join the BJP. The BJP wants to put pressure on our leaders and drag them. We have called all the MLAs to Mumbai on February 14 and the Congress Legislature Party meeting will be held the next day. After that, we will have a two-day study camp at Lonavala, where all of us will meet to plan our future strategy.
Is there fear of cross-voting in the Rajya Sabha elections, and who will be your candidate?Advertisement
This is an open election. There is no chance of cross-voting. Those who try to do it will be disqualified and barred from contesting elections for six years. The party high command will finalise the candidate from Maharashtra in a day.",politics
"Among SP’s Rajya Sabha names, ex-IAS, Akhilesh aide and rising Kayastha face","Of the three candidates announced by the Samajwadi Party Tuesday for the 10 Rajya Sabha seats falling vacant in Uttar Pradesh, the unusual inclusion was retired bureaucrat and former state chief secretary Alok Ranjan.
However, the 1978-batch IAS officer is a familiar face in SP ranks. The 67-year-old Ranjan served as the state chief secretary from May 2014 to June 2016 under then chief minister Akhilesh Singh, and, on retirement, was appointed his chief adviser with the rank of a Cabinet minister. He held the post until the end of the SP government’s term in March 2017.
Asked about his nomination by the SP, Ranjan told The Indian Express, “It is very nice of (Akhilesh) to consider me for the post. I have not been part of the SP but would now be. While I kept myself busy after retirement, now I would start my political journey.”Advertisement
After filing his nomination in Akhilesh’s presence on Tuesday, Ranjan wrote on X, “The strength of our nation lies in the power of our democracy… Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha are not just houses of Parliament, they are the platforms where the voice of our people rules supreme. It is this voice and their welfare that I will strive for.”
Sources in the SP say Ranjan has been a part of Akhilesh’s “think tank” and “strategy-making” team for a while now, including the last seven years of the SP in Opposition. Party leaders say he played a significant role in drafting the SP’s 2022 Assembly poll manifesto as well, and was with Akhilesh at the release of the document.

Ranjan also played a significant role in preparing the party’s arguments and data to counter the ruling BJP on policy and governance issues during the polls.
His nomination is also seen as part of the SP’s efforts towards social engineering. Ranjan, who hails from the Unnao district adjacent to the state capital of Lucknow, is a Kayastha, a community that is dominant in a significant number of seats, especially in central UP.Advertisement
Kayastha are considered upper caste in UP and a loyal BJP support base. Recently though, in another proof of Ranjan’s rising profile, the Vishwa Kayastha Sansthan established a unit in the state and nominated him as its chairman.
“We are not surprised with his nomination. He would be an asset to the party considering his past as an officer of competence when it comes to governance and that he is also very active within his community,” said a senior SP leader.

As a bureaucrat, Ranjan oversaw the completion of significant infrastructure and development projects. Several key projects under the SP government, from the Lucknow-Agra Expressway and the Lucknow Metro to the Dial 100 programme, were executed during Ranjan’s tenure.
Ranjan had also served as the commissioner of the Infrastructure and Industrial Development Department under Akhilesh. In 2002, he was the joint secretary, defence, for the Central government. Prior to that, he served as Secretary to BJP CM Kalyan Singh in 1998.Advertisement
Since retiring, Ranjan has also authored four books on public policy and leadership. He is currently a visiting professor at IIM Lucknow and is associated with other educational institutes in Lucknow.",politics
"From the Urdu Press: ‘Uttarakhand UCC to test waters before national push’, ‘BJP moves leave INDIA splintered’","The curtain came down on the 17th Lok Sabha with the battle lines firmly drawn. In his final speeches in both Houses of Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a trenchant criticism of the main Opposition Congress, framing the upcoming Lok Sabha polls as a contest between the BJP and the grand old party and their visions and track records. The Congress hit back, even as the party finds itself lurching from crisis to crisis. These stories made headlines in the Urdu dailies. What however dominated their coverage was the passage of the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill in Uttarakhand, with the dailies keeping the spotlight on the growing concerns and anxieties of the Muslim community over the contentious legislation.
INQUILAB
Commenting on the BJP-led Uttarakhand government’s move to pass the UCC Bill, the New Delhi edition of Inquilab, in its February 9 editorial headlined ‘Mulk bhar mein UCC ki janib pehla qadam (First step towards nationwide UCC)’, says the passage of the legislation was not surprising given the BJP’s absolute majority in the Assembly. “What is notable is the haste with which the Bill was pushed through the House even though the Opposition sought more time for its consideration, calling for referring it to a Select Committee, which was rejected,” it says. “This legislation is called Uniform Code, but tribals have been exempted from it. If there are reasons for keeping tribals out of its ambit, why Muslims’ strong objections to it were not taken into account?”
The daily writes that the BJP has twin political objectives for bringing this UCC. “First, it is aimed at polarisation, for which the BJP never misses any opportunity — from talaq to hijab to CAA to renaming of towns and stations. There are many such examples, with the Uttarakhand UCC being the latest,” it states. “This was done just ahead of the Lok Sabha polls so that BJP leaders could make the pitch in their campaign that the party has fulfilled its UCC promise in Uttarakhand and would replicate it in the country.”Advertisement

The editorial says the BJP’s second objective could be to see the reactions the Uttarakhand UCC would evoke among political parties, various organisations and civil society activists. The plan could be to test the waters in one state before pushing it across the country, it says, adding that the ruling party would also like to see the response of courts in UCC matters now. “Although courts have called for the need to have a UCC, whether this legislation stands the test of various legal and constitutional parameters is to be seen,” the edit says. “Its various provisions appear to be violative of key fundamental rights like freedom of religion and privacy.”
SIASAT
Referring to the turmoil in the Opposition INDIA bloc, the Hyderabad-based Siasat, in its leader on February 10, writes that a realignment of political ties and equations is taking place before the Lok Sabha polls, with the BJP firming up its position. “The INDIA alliance is falling apart, with the BJP playing its role to ensure it. The BJP is now pitching for ‘400 paar (winning 400-plus seats)’ and is taking all steps to pull off even this target,” it says.
The Opposition alliance had run into trouble soon after its inception, with the relations between its constituents beset with suspicions and misgivings, the editorial states. Pointing to its key architect Nitish Kumar crossing over to the BJP-led NDA and the splits in the Shiv Sena and NCP, the edit says. “All this is part of the BJP’s expansionist game plan.”
The daily states that PM Modi announced the Bharat Ratna for BJP veteran L K Advani, the face of the Ram Temple movement, to further consolidate the party’s Hindutva base. He later also declared the Bharat Ratna for former PMs Chaudhary Charan Singh and P V Narasimha Rao, which also had political objectives, says the daily. “Charan Singh’s grandson and RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary, an ally of the INDIA bloc, is now jumping ship to join the NDA. He has been showering praises on the Modi government. The RLD’s exit would leave SP chief Akhilesh Yadav in the cold, whose relations with the Congress are already strained,” the editorial says.Advertisement
“Similarly, by awarding the country’s highest civilian honour to Narasimha Rao, the BJP dispensation is looking to woo the voters in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, even as it is moving to ally with the TDP,” it says. “The BJP has succeeded in splintering INDIA allies in key states like UP, Bihar and Maharashtra. Whether people approve it or not will be determined by the poll outcome, but the BJP has left nothing to chance to firm up the political realignment it has triggered.”
ROZNAMA RASHTRIYA SAHARA
Highlighting the face-off between the BJP and Congress over the handling of the economy, the multi-edition Roznama Rashtriya Sahara, in its February 10 editorial, writes that the trading of criticism between the government and the Opposition is a sign of a healthy democracy. “But when such exchanges degenerate into animosity aimed at maligning each other, it turns into bitter hostility,” it says, adding that the Modi government sprang a surprise by bringing a White Paper on the alleged mismanagement of the economy by the Congress-led UPA government under economist Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The Congress also released a ‘Black Paper’ to rebut this and mount a counter-attack on the Modi government’s alleged mishandling of the economy.
The government’s White Paper, tabled in Parliament by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, stated that the economy had been in dire straits during the UPA regime, the editorial says. The economy grew rapidly before 2008 due to the reforms undertaken by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government, and it become “stagnant” later, said the White Paper, the editorial says, adding that the document reflected a bid to score political points and was of a piece with the Modi dispensation’s policy of targeting the Congress and the Nehru-Gandhi family.
The daily says the Congress’s Black Paper targeted the Modi government for its alleged failures on multiple fronts, citing unemployment, price rise and crony capitalism. “The Congress document accused the Modi government of failing various sections including farmers, labourers and women. It says Modi had pledged 2 crore jobs annually besides doubling farmers’ income by 2022. It also points out fiscal discrimination against Opposition-ruled states,” it says, adding that both camps have brought out these documents to run down the other’s track record. “It would have been better if the NDA government had released a White Paper on its accomplishments over the last 10 years rather than going back to the past to find faults in the UPA’s functioning.”",politics
"Sonia Gandhi opts for Rajya Sabha, Priyanka may make poll debut from Raebareli in LS elections","Barely a month ahead of the expected announcement of the Lok Sabha election schedule, Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) chairperson Sonia Gandhi has opted for a Rajya Sabha berth instead of contesting again from Raebareli that she has represented since 2004. Her decision to take the Upper House route has triggered talk in party circles that her daughter and All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra may make her electoral debut from Raebareli in the parliamentary polls.
Sonia will contest from Rajasthan, where the Congress is in a position to win one of the three seats up for grabs in the February 27 polls. Both the Karnataka and Telangana units of the party had urged the 72-year-old leader to contest the Rajya Sabha polls from their state but the party decided against it since Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge is from Karnataka and Rahul Gandhi is an MP from Kerala. Congress insiders said Sonia contesting from Rajasthan would send the signal that the Gandhi family had not abandoned the Hindi heartland. Rahul’s decision to contest from Wayanad and Amethi in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections had come in for criticism both inside and outside the party.
The Congress was routed in the Hindi heartland in 2019, with Rahul himself losing from Amethi to current Union Minister Smriti Irani. The drubbing was so severe that the party drew a blank in Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi, won only one seat in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand, and managed just two seats in Chhattisgarh. Sources said Rahul might contest again from Amethi and Wayanad and Priyanka could replace her mother in the family borough of Raebareli.Advertisement

Sonia became an MP for the first time in 1999 from Amethi, a seat once represented by her late husband Rajiv Gandhi. She shifted to Raebareli in 2004, leaving Amethi for Rahul. Sonia will become the second member of the Nehru-Gandhi family to enter the Rajya Sabha. Her mother-in-law and former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was a member of the Upper House from 1964 to 1967 before she won the Lok Sabha election from Raebareli.
Gandhi family’s South connection
Members of the Gandhi family in the past have sought southern comfort during challenging times but rarely took the Rajya Sabha route. Indira took the Rajya Sabha route early in her political career. In 1978, she turned to Karnataka to contest a Lok Sabha by-election from Chikkamagaluru and trounced her Janata Party rival Veerendra Patil. In 1980, Indira contested from Raebareli and Medak in undivided Andhra Pradesh. She won both and chose to retain Medak.

In 1999, Sonia chose Bellary in Karnataka when she decided to take the political plunge. The Congress is positioned to win three of the four seats in Karnataka, two of the three in Telangana, and one each in Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. Of the 56 MPs retiring on April 2 and 3, 28 are from the BJP and 10 are from the Congress. The party has the strength to get one of its members elected in Maharashtra but the exit of former CM Ashok Chavan and the speculation that several party MLAs too might quit have injected an element of uncertainty.
Sources said Sonia would file her nomination papers on Wednesday. The party announced that the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra would be on a break on Wednesday, indicating that Rahul and possibly Kharge would accompany Sonia to Jaipur. The three vacancies in Rajasthan arose because of the retirement of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Union Minister Bhupender Yadav, and the resignation of Kirodi Lal Meena who is now a Rajasthan Cabinet Minister.",politics
"AAP govts at two ends, BJP-led Haryana in middle: Farmer protest ripe for politics","AS BJP-RULED Haryana put up barricades on the border with Punjab to stop protesting farmers from proceeding towards Delhi, resulting in clashes, lathicharge and lobbying of teargas shells, blame game has begun between it and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).
Before they ran into barricades on two border points with Haryana, at Shambhu and Khanauri, the farmers had a smooth passage through Punjab, with the police deployed along the routes making no attempt to stop them. The AAP, which rules both Punjab and Delhi, was quick to underline that while the party stood with the farmers’ demands, the BJP government in Haryana was standing in the way of the Dilli Chalo call given by the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee and Samyukta Kisan Morcha (non-political).
Among other things, the farmers are seeking MSP guarantee for 23 crops, waiver of their debts and withdrawal of cases registered against them during the 2020-21 farmers’ agitation. The Centre, which burnt its hands with that agitation, which lasted a year on Delhi’s borders and ended only after the scrapping of the three farm laws, held two rounds of meetings with farmer leaders in a bid to stall the march, without success.Advertisement

On Tuesday, as clashes erupted and the Opposition parties criticised the Centre, Union Agriculture Minister Arjun Munda said the MSP law cannot be brought in a hurry and the farmers should come forward for talks with the government.
The BJP would not want the farmer protest to blow up so close to the Lok Sabha elections. One of the reasons for its recent tie-up with the RLD, given its base among farmers, was assuaging residual farmer anger over the last protest. The Centre also sent another message to farmers, across Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, with its Bharat Ratna to the late Chaudhary Charan Singh.

In 2020, after the Punjab government then led by the Congress had not made any effort to stop the farmers from reaching Delhi, the BJP had accused then Chief Minister Amarinder Singh of complicity. It had said the Congress was trying to instigate the farmers with an eye on the Assembly elections due in 2022.
Sources in the Punjab government confirmed that this time too, the police had not been given any instructions regarding stopping the latest farmers’ march.Advertisement

Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann has also been quiet, though he had attacked farmers during the previous protest for stopping trains and inconveniencing people.
Incidentally, on Friday, Mann was roped in by the Centre to act as a mediator in talks held between farmer organisations and its ministers Piyush Goyal, Arjun Munda and Nityanand Rai. After the meeting, Mann said he had tried his best to reach a resolution.

For the second round of talks on Monday, Mann sent his Cabinet colleague Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal, but this meeting too remained inconclusive.
On Tuesday, anger at the farmer protest sites was reserved for the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar. Some asked why “Haryana is behaving like Pakistan”. “Just look at the multi-tier barricading. There are boulders, nails, barbed wire, steel walls and and then tear gas shells,” a farmer said.Advertisement

Jagjit Singh Dalewal of the Bharti Kisan Union (Sidhupur) and the convenor of the Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (Non-Political) said: “What are we doing? We just want to reach Delhi and organise a peaceful protest. We have promised we will not harm anyone. Why are they not allowing us free passage?”
Accusing the AAP government of “instigating” farmers, Haryana Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kanwar Pal Gujjar said it was all politics. “The AAP is actually not talking about farmers’ rights. Only the BJP is doing that,” Gujjar claimed.

Dismissing this, AAP chief spokesperson Malvinder Singh Kang said: “Why would we instigate anyone? Are farmers not aware that their demands have not been met? It was a commitment made by the Prime Minister himself two years ago, and never fulfilled.”
Kang also pointed out that Mann had tried to broker peace. “But he saw that the BJP was not flexible. They did not have any intention to fulfill farmers’ demands… Now, the Central ministers are behaving in the same way as they were doing earlier.”Advertisement
Kang added that Punjab had no reason to stop the farmers. “They have genuine demands. If their demands are not met now, they will raise the same during election time.”",politics
"With Scindia driving pre-poll exodus from Cong, 300 Gwalior, Vidisha leaders cross over to BJP","Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia is leaving no stone unturned to ensure that the battered Madhya Pradesh Congress is further damaged in the Gwalior-Chambal region ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.
While a district Youth Congress (YC) president, five sitting Congress councillors and over 300 party leaders switched to the BJP in Gwalior on Monday, several other Congress leaders jumped ship in Vidisha.
In Gwalior, Scindia welcomed district YC president Ajay Pal Yadav into the BJP. Ajay is the brother of KP Yadav, the sitting Guna MP and former Scindia loyalist, who switched over to the BJP and defeated the Gwalior royal scion from his traditional seat in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

Last month, another Scindia loyalist and former Congress MLA from Morena Rakesh Mavai had also switched to the BJP.
With the entry of the five councillors, the BJP’s tally in the Gwalior Municipal Corporation has risen to 41. In 2022, a Congress candidate – Shobha Sikarwar – was elected as the mayor for the first time in 57 years despite the BJP being the single largest party winning 34 of the 66 seats.
In the 2023 Assembly elections, Scindia was seen to be instrumental in the BJP winning 18 of 34 seats in the region, up from the seven they won in 2018, as he addressed over 100 meetings. The Congress managed to win 16 seats as opposed to the 26 they won in 2018. Scindia was part of the Congress during the 2018 polls.

In the run-up to the November 2023 polls, when it could win just 66 out of 230 seats, the Congress had been trying to get Scindia loyalists into its fold in an attempt to weaken him in his stronghold.Advertisement
Abhay Chaudhary, BJP Gwalior (urban) district president said the induction of five councillors was important. “Congress leaders have grown weary of the lack of leadership as the party is gripped with infighting and Dijvijaya Singh has no impact in the region now. They (Congress leaders) have confidence in Maharaj (Scindia). Many senior (Congress) leaders also want to join us,” he said.
Since the announcement of the Assembly poll results, Scindia has become proactive in Gwalior-Chambal with his aides claiming that he has addressed over 50 meetings over the last 10 days. In an attempt to shed his “royal” tag and establish a stronger ground-level connection with voters, Scindia has been touring the region extensively.
On Monday, he addressed a gathering of Ladli Behna and Ujjwala scheme beneficiaries in Dabra, from where his loyalist Imarti Devi lost the Assembly polls.
Scindia has been seen attending important events of different communities and has met members of the Gurjar and tribal communities. He was also seen engaging in various public events, playing gilli-danda, taking selfies and taking part in local sport festivals.Advertisement
The Union Minister also undertook a five-day tour of all eight Assembly segments falling under the Guna-Shivpuri Lok Sabha seat between February 3 and 7 while on January 21 and 22, he visited Guna, Ashoknagar and Shivpuri districts as a part of the BJP’s Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra.
“They are coming (to the BJP) as they are impressed with our policies. Scindia ji has worked hard and his public acceptance has grown. He is slowly transforming into a mass leader,” the BJP’s Gwalior district (rural) president Kaushal Sharma told The Indian Express.
In Vidisha, district Congress president Rakesh Katare, former Tikamgarh MLA Dinesh Ahirwar, former Chhatarpur mandi vice-president Kailash Dwivedi, Gaurihar Janpad president Tulsi Anuragi and other leaders like Ashish Dwivedi and Anil Dixit joined the BJP at the party’s state office in Bhopal.
While state BJP chief V D Sharma said the Congress was in a disarray while the BJP’s graph was steadily rising, Katare said he was hurt the day the Congress rejected the invite for the Ram Temple consecration.Advertisement

"Rumblings in INDIA bloc in J&K as NC, PDP slug it out over sharing Valley seats","The Lok Sabha elections are barely a couple of months away, but uncertainty continues to surround the Opposition INDIA alliance’s seat sharing in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.
At the centre of this uncertainty are the three parliamentary seats in the Kashmir Valley, with the National Conference (NC) keen to contest from all of them. The NC is one of the three constituents of the alliance in Jammu and Kashmir that also include the Congress and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP).
Over the last six months, NC leaders including Omar Abdullah have repeatedly staked their claim on the Valley’s three seats that are currently represented by its MPs – Farooq Abdullah, Hasnain Masoodi and Mohammad Akbar Lone.Advertisement
On the other hand, the NC’s main rival in Kashmir, the PDP, has agreed to settle for a smaller share of seats.
After the collapse of its coalition government with the BJP in 2018, the party lost all these three seats in 2019, including its South Kashmir stronghold of Anantnag where PDP president Mehbooba Mufti lost to the NC’s first-timer, Hasnain Masoodi. This time, the PDP wants the NC to contest the Srinagar and the Baramulla constituencies and leave Anantnag for the party.

The Congress, too, seems to be in agreement with the PDP’s proposal. Of these seats, the Congress can claim to have a substantial vote bank only in Anantnag, where former state unit president Ghulam Ahmad Mir stood second in the 2019 elections ahead of Mufti. However, the Congress has moved Mir out of the equation by appointing him as an All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in charge of West Bengal and Jharkhand.
With the Rajouri and Poonch districts now a part of the Anantnag constituency after re-organisation, sitting MP Masoodi’s sway in the seat has weakened, especially since his stronghold in the Pulwama region is now part of the Srinagar constituency, which has further bolstered the PDP’s claim on Anantnag.Advertisement
While the Congress did not field a nominee in Srinagar in the 2019 elections, its candidate in Baramulla, Haji Farooq Ahmad, finished fifth, managing to get just 34,000 votes or 7.6% of the votes polled.
Both the PDP and the NC are keen on the Congress contesting the two seats in Jammu. While the PDP wants the Congress to contest from Ladakh as well, the NC has a renewed interest in Ladakh after its recent success in the Kargil Hill Development Council elections. In the 2014 Assembly election, the Congress secured three of the four Assembly seats in Ladakh. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the seat, however, was secured by the BJP’s Jamyang Tsering Namgyal with Congress candidate Rigzin Spalbar coming at fourth position.
The differences within the INDIA bloc over seat-sharing could throw up some interesting results in the Baramulla constituency, where Sajad Gani Lone’s People’s Conference and Altaf Bukhari’s Apni Party are likely to join hands.
The NC appears to be lacking a strong candidate for Baramulla – incumbent MP Mohammad Akbar Lone has not been keeping well for some time. If Lone jumps into the fray and is supported by Bukhari, he could pose a strong challenge to the NC.Advertisement

In the 2019 parliamentary elections, Sajad’s first-time candidate Raja Ajaz Ali gave a stiff competition to the NC in Baramulla, securing over a lakh votes and coming second. While Sajad and Bukhari are said to be close to the BJP, any division in the anti-BJP votes in the event of the INDIA alliance’s failure to finalise seat-sharing may give Sajad an edge.
“It is a tricky situation for us,” said an NC leader on seat sharing. “We want to put up a united fight but then you don’t want to give space to your political rival, especially when you feel you are strong. It is also difficult to convince your workers to vote for someone you had always been opposing. But whatever decision is taken, it would be in the interest of the people here.”

A Congress leader also called for putting up a united fight to “defeat the nefarious designs of the BJP”. “We can have politics some other time. We can have them during the local elections. But what we need right now is to stand up to the BJP,” he said. “If we join hands, we would be in a strong position to defeat the BJP not only in Kashmir but in Jammu as well.”
For the PDP, it is time to wait and watch. While the party hopes that it would get the Anantnag seat after the negotiations, it is also looking for candidates if talks fail. “As of now, we are hopeful of an agreement. But if that doesn’t materialise, we would have to field our own candidates,” a PDP leader said. “As a political party, you can’t leave the space open for Opposition when they are not ready to budge an inch. It would be a matter of survival then.”",politics
Jaya Bachchan set for 5th Rajya Sabha term: A look at her Parliament career till now,"The Rajya Sabha has seen many actors as its members but not many have been as active and combative as Jaya Bachchan.
The veteran actor-turned-politician is all set for her fifth Rajya Sabha term as the Samajwadi Party (SP) on Tuesday renominated her as its candidate for the Upper House from Uttar Pradesh. With this, in the SP camp, she is on the cusp of equalling the record of Ram Gopal Yadav who became the first party leader to serve as a member of the Upper House five times. Along with Bachchan, the SP also named Ramji Lal Suman and Alok Ranjan from UP for the February 27 Rajya Sabha polls.

Bachchan is not known for taking things lying down. Following her heated exchange with Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar last week, she said in her farewell speech, “I am frequently asked why I get upset. I am that way by nature; I am not changeable. I lose my temper if I don’t like or agree with something. I apologise if I offended any of you or became personal.”Advertisement
The actor-turned-politician is also one of the most active parliamentarians around. According to the legislative research body PRS, Bachchan, 75, has had an attendance of 82% in the Upper House between 2009 and 2024, three percentage points higher than the national average of 79%. However, it is a percentage point lower than the average for UP, the state she represents.
As against a national average of 199.7 for participation in Rajya Sabha debates, the actor has taken part in 292 debates between 2009 and 2024, significantly higher than UP’s average of 193.8 on this parameter. Bachchan has not introduced any Private Members’ Bill to date. She asked 451 questions during Question Hour in this period as against a national and state average of 667.02 and 598.07, respectively.

Bachchan has not missed a single sitting of the Rajya Sabha from the Monsoon Session of 2023 until the recently concluded Budget Session. While in the Budget Session of 2010, her attendance was only 13%, it was nil in the first session of 2009.
In the course of her four Rajya Sabha terms so far, Bachchan has spoken on a range of issues such as the safety of women and their rights, street children, most polluted cities, politicisation of religion in the country, controversial statements by people in public office, need to criminalise marital rape, suicides and mental health issues, demand to confer Bharat Ratna on Mirza Ghalib, and the need to eliminate creamy layer consideration in reservation for people of backward classes.Advertisement
She has also asked questions on issues such as forest fires, cyber security, linking of major rivers, poor living conditions of retired personnel of the central armed police forces, and illegal occupation of ASI land, among other things.
Bachchan has also found herself in several rows. During a discussion on the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Amendment) Bill in 2021, when questioned about the summons sent to her daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in the Panama Papers case, she said, “Your bad days will be here soon … I curse you.” She then went on to call out the Chair for not listening to the Opposition.
In September 2020, amid a row following the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, Bachchan gave a Zero Hour notice in the House to discuss “the alleged conspiracy to defame the film industry”.",politics
"Keeping AAP in crosshairs, Congress steps up bid to pick LS faces for all Punjab seats","Following the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)’s announcement to go solo in Punjab in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls, the state Congress has recommended multiple names for each of the state’s 13 Lok Sabha seats to the AICC-constituted screening committee led by Bhakta Charan Das.
In addition to the recommended names, the party may also invite applications from workers who wish to contest the seats. The issue was discussed in the meeting of the screening committee, which has been tasked with shortlisting of the Lok Sabha candidates, at the Punjab Congress Bhawan in Chandigarh on Monday. The panel, which met for the second time, includes AICC general secretary in charge of Punjab Devender Yadav, state party chief Amrinder Singh Raja Warring and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Partap Singh Bajwa.
Congress insiders said six sitting MPs are among the candidates recommended to the screening committee.Advertisement
“A decision on inviting more applications will be taken in a day or two and if approved, additional names will be sent to the screening committee. The exercise is being conducted in a professional manner,” Warring told The Indian Express. Once all the applications are received, the Congress will assess the candidates on the basis of “winnability” through an internal survey before taking a final decision.
A senior Congress leader said the party will give due representation to leaders across communities. “Discussions are also being held to Hindu candidates in constituencies where urban voters are in the majority,” he said, adding that the selection of Dalit candidates for the SC-reserved seats will largely be based on the quantum of sub-caste votes.
On February 1, the 27-member Punjab Congress’s election committee, comprising Warring, Bajwa, former CM Charanjit Singh Channi and former Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, held a video conference with the screening committee as the Congress wants to finalise candidates at the earliest to kickstart the campaign sooner than its rivals, a senior party leader said.
The state Congress, which is the principal Opposition, has been largely opposed to any pre-poll alliance with the AAP, although both parties are constituents of the INDIA bloc.Advertisement
AICC chief Mallikarjun Kharge, at a party workers’ convention in Samrala on Sunday, hinted that the Congress-AAP alliance in Punjab was not working out. “The decision to have an INDIA bloc was taken for the country and not just Punjab,” he had said. Meanwhile, Warring was more vocal and said the Congress would “crush” the ruling AAP in the parliamentary polls in the state.
The Congress has also been carrying out a similar exercise in neighbouring Haryana to shortlist its Lok Sabha candidates there.
Dealing a blow to the INDIA alliance, AAP supremo and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced last Saturday that his party will contest all 13 seats in Punjab as well as the Chandigarh seat on its own steam.
In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the Congress had won eight seats as against the SAD’s two seats and the BJP’s two in Punjab. The AAP had then won just one seat. The Chandigarh seat was won by the BJP’s Kirron Kher.",politics
"BJP veteran, liked by Nitish Kumar, is new Bihar Speaker","BJP veteran and seven-time Patna Sahib MLA Nand Kishore Yadav is all set to become the new Speaker of the Bihar Assembly.
He filed his nomination for the position on Tuesday, a day after his predecessor, Awadh Bihari Choudhary of the RJD, was voted out in a no-confidence motion before Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s new NDA government won its trust vote in the Assembly.
Yadav (70) comes from an RSS background, and was first elected as an MLA in 1995. He has served as a minister under Nitish Kumar multiple times in the past, and is known to be close to the CM. But after the 2020 Assembly elections, he was among several veteran BJP leaders in the state who took a back seat.Advertisement
Now, the party has decided to bring the Yadav leader back to the forefront in its bid to strike an EBC, OBC and upper caste balance in the new ruling dispensation. He became the clear choice for the Speaker’s post also because of his proximity to Nitish Kumar.

Yadav brings rich organisational and administrative experience, having served as BJP state president in the late 1990s and later as Cabinet minister, holding important portfolios such as Road Construction and Health. He was also Leader of Opposition after the NDA split in June 2013.
Former deputy CMs Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi, as well as some other senior BJP leaders who were in contention for the Speaker’s position, were ruled out as Yadav emerged as the NDA’s unanimous choice for the role.",politics
"Reeling from Sandeshkhali unrest, TMC moves to control damage as BJP, CPI(M) turn up heat","With the Lok Sabha elections fast approaching, a series of incidents in West Bengal’s Sandeshkhali have given the Opposition parties an opportunity to target the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC).
Sandeshkhali, spread over two blocks in the North 24 Parganas district, made the headlines following the January 5 attack on Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials when they arrived to to raid the residence of Sheikh Shahjahan, a local TMC leader and strongman, in connection with an alleged ration scam. But, his many local supporters attacked the ED team, leaving three officials injured.
Since then, the ED, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and state police have failed to arrest Shahjahan, who is still on the run.Advertisement

A month after Shahjahan absconded, on February 8, women in Sandeshkhali took to the streets with brooms and sticks, demanding the immediate arrest of the former and his two aides Shiba Prasad Hazra and Uttam Sardar.
The next day, the protesters attacked properties belonging to Hazra and set fire to his poultry farm. Locals said the poultry farm was set up on a plot of land the TMC leader had allegedly usurped.
Local women also alleged that Shahjahan and his aides had assaulted and exploited them for years. On Saturday, the police imposed Section 144 in various areas of Sandeshkhali and an internet shutdown in 16 panchayats.
In a bid to pacify angry villagers in Sandeshkhali, the TMC leadership suspended Uttam Sardar from the party, though the party said it did not find any allegations against Hazra. In a move that was criticised by the Opposition, Sardar was arrested only after his suspension.Advertisement

We have already sent the state women’s commission team to Sandeshkhali and multiple arrests have been made. The situation is being monitored closely and necessary steps are being taken. Those who are involved in this violence, all of them will be arrested,” she said.
A senior TMC leader said the protests were orchestrated by the Opposition. “Some of our leaders in Sandeshkhali are embroiled in controversies. But protests that happened last week were not the real picture, that was organised by the CPI(M) and BJP,” the leader claimed.
The TMC’s sitting Sandeshkhali MLA Sukumar Mahata has denied local women’s allegations. The local police has also said the allegations are “baseless”.Advertisement

The TMC won from the Sandeshkhali Assembly seat in the last two polls, and the Basirhat Lok Sabha seat in the last three polls. The party now appears to be in damage control mode to prevent the unrest from spreading to nearby areas.
Both the BJP and CPI(M) are looking to capitalise on the situation. As the BJP and CPI(M) delegations tried to enter Sandeshkhali, police stopped them, including the BJP’s Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari. “Tomorrow the TMC delegation will go and Section 144 will be lifted. We are seeing all the developments,” Adhikari said.
Given the proximity of Sandeshkhali to the Bangladesh border and local opposition to illegal immigration, the BJP is framing the issue along religious lines. “In Sandeshkhali, 67% of the population is either Scheduled Tribe or Scheduled Caste. They were tortured by the local Muslim TMC leaders. After the Shahjahan row, the Hindu population came out to protest,” a senior BJP leader said.

On the other hand, the CPI(M) is claiming that their organisation is still intact at the grassroots level there. A district committee member of the CPI(M) said the local support it received during their protest was a sign of the party gaining ground in the area. “Our leader Nirapada Sardar was local MLA from 2011 to 2016 but lost in 2016. We thought the people of Sandeshkhali went to the BJP camp like other parts of West Bengal. But when we started to organise people against Sheikh Shahjahan, we saw that we have a footing and they are ready to protest against TMC goons till the end. The TMC cannot stop us by arresting our leaders,” he said.",politics
"Ashok Chavan joins exit queue, Maharashtra Congress frets about central, state leadership","A HUSHED blame game has started in the Maharashtra Congress after the resignation of former chief minister Ashok Chavan from the party, close on the heels of two other leaders quitting the state unit.
At least two senior leaders said Monday that the high command had failed to address the concerns of party leaders like Chavan, and said there should be “instrospection” on why people were leaving.
However, others pointed to the twin threats hanging over the heads of many leaders – of probes by Central agencies, and of uncertainty about their own political futures. And that no amount of mollycoddling would have guaranteed their allegiance to the party.Advertisement

In its official reaction on Chavan leaving the party, the Congress laid the blame at his and the BJP’s door, suggesting that he had succumbed to the pressure of the cases against him.
Announcing his resignation Monday, Chavan was silent on his political future and refrained from attacking the Congress. “I’m not going to criticise anyone. It’s not in my nature to air my grievances in public,” he said.
Senior leader Sanjay Nirupam, who called Chavan an “indispensable” leader, blamed his exit on the “behaviour” of state Congress leaders. “Ashok Chavan was definitely an asset to the party. Some are calling him a liability, some are blaming the Enforcement Directorate. All these are knee-jerk reactions. In reality, he was troubled by the behaviour of one particular senior Congress leader from Maharashtra. He had at various times alerted the party senior leadership about his concerns. Had his complaints been taken seriously, this moment would not have arisen.”
Nirupam added: “He is a skilled, resourceful organiser with a mass following. The entire leadership witnessed his capabilities in 2022, when the Bharat Jodo Yatra crossed Nanded district over four days… No one can compensate for him. It was our responsibility to take care of him.”Advertisement

Former Mumbai Congress chief and MLC Bhai Jagtap said the central leadership must introspect on the reasons behind senior leaders quitting the party. “Till only a few months ago, the party stood strong in Mumbai and Maharashtra. The central leadership must seriously think about what has happened in these past few months that senior leaders are quitting. This is not good for the party, it creates panic in the minds of our workers,” he said, hinting that the blame lay with the incumbent party presidents of Mumbai and Maharashtra.
Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole, in fact, was the focus of ire of most state leaders who spoke in Chavan’s favour Monday. Patole, who crossed over from the BJP to the Congress, has had a prickly relationship with senior Congress leaders, attributed to his brusque nature.
Reacting to Chavan’s resignation, Patole said Monday: “The Congress has given a lot to many leaders. It is unfortunate that today, when the party is fighting to save democracy and the Constitution, leaders who have got everything from it are quitting the party and its ideology. Who is going where, for what? The public is watching.”
Last year, senior state Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat complained to the high command about being “humiliated” by Patole over the election of Thorat’s nephew Satyajeet Tambe as an MLC, while contesting as an Independent. The state Congress leadership had not viewed this kindly.Advertisement
However, other Congress insiders said much water has flown under the bridge since then, and that the high command has been alert to the concerns of senior leaders lately.

They point to the fact that, in June 2023, when Chavan met Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge demanding reforms in the state unit and suggesting measures to improve the party’s performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, he was heard out for over three hours and his concerns given due respect.
Two months later, Chavan was made a member of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), replacing Balasaheb Thorat. Then, in December 2023, he was deputed by the party leadership to hold seat-sharing talks for Maharashtra within the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA).
The party had done everything it could to assuage Chavan, despite increasing concerns about his “commitment” to the party, the leaders said.Advertisement
Speculations about Chavan quitting the party and joining the BJP – which hasn’t happened yet – have been around since July 2022, when, during the trust vote against the Eknath Shinde government, he arrived late along with seven other Congress MLAs, and wasn’t allowed into the Assembly to vote. The charge was that he did this deliberately to help the Shinde-led BJP-Sena faction win the trust vote.",politics
"Today in Politics: With farmers set to march to Delhi, why it is a big test for both BJP govt and INDIA bloc","The passage of three controversial agriculture laws in Parliament in 2020 sparked a year-long protest by farmers’ groups, which camped on Delhi’s borders for months till the government finally relented and repealed the farm laws in late 2021.
Now, the farmers will be on the move again on Tuesday, months before the Lok Sabha elections, after talks with the Centre broke down late on Monday night. The farmers are demanding, among other things, a law to guarantee a Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops, pensions and debt waivers, and compensation for the families of farmers who died in the 2020-’21 protests.
More than 200 farmer unions are expected to participate in the “Delhi Chalo” march on Tuesday. Led by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (Non-Political) and the Kisan Mazdoor Morcha, farmers primarily from Haryana, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh will march to Delhi amid tight security at the borders. Authorities have imposed Section 144 and internet shutdowns in some areas and blocked major roads using concrete blocks, iron nails, and barbed wire.Advertisement
For the anti-BJP parties in the Opposition, which appear in a tight spot at the moment, these protests are an opportunity to corner the ruling party and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has made farmers central to his election campaign. The PM late last year said farmers were among the four major “castes” — along with the poor, the youth, and women — whose uplift would spur development across India.

The Congress has already begun to criticise the government on its record on agriculture. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who is on the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, posted on X, “Modi, who ‘cultivates lies’ day and night, has only cheated farmers in the last 10 years. Promising doubling of their income, Modi also made farmers struggle for MSP … Those who put nails in the path of farmers are not worthy of trust.”
Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav accused the BJP government of following the “policy of deceit in the name of farmers”. He said, “On one hand, the government gave Bharat Ratna to the messiah of farmers Chaudhary Charan Singh ji and on the other hand, it is harassing the farmers by using force to stop them from reaching Delhi.” On Monday, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief and Charan Singh’s grandson Jayant Chaudhary left the INDIA bloc to join the NDA.
Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said the Union government should accept the farmers’ “genuine demands” and criticised the security response. “There is as much barbed wire on the roads (at Punjab-Haryana borders) to go to Delhi as there is at the border with Pakistan,” he said.Advertisement
As much as the protests are a test of the government and the BJP’s skills of negotiation and diplomacy to ensure they do not escalate, the “Delhi Chalo” march also presents the INDIA group of Opposition parties with a unique opportunity and challenge.
For the beleaguered alliance, which has been hit by the exits of the JD(U) and RLD in recent weeks, the key is going to be finding a way of making the farmers’ issues front and centre of its political messaging so that it can push the BJP on the back foot for a change. The alliance has not yet formulated a strategy for coordinating the ground activities of its constituents and the farmers’ protests provide a golden chance to do just that.

TMC delegation in Sandeshkhali
Amid unrest in West Bengal’s Sandeshkhali, where the Trinamool Congress (TMC) has been caught up in a series of controversies – from the attack on Enforcement Directorate officials investigating its local leader to allegations of sexual violence and land-grabbing against its members – a delegation of the ruling party in the state will visit the area on Tuesday.
While the TMC is hoping to quell the anger – it suspended one of the accused last Saturday – the Opposition will look to use the situation to attack the government and question its handling of law and order, something it has repeatedly raised since the post-Assembly poll violence in 2021 and the panchayat election violence last year.Advertisement

It has also named several candidates unilaterally, including for three seats in Assam and one in Gujarat.

"Three RJD MLAs cross-vote in Bihar trust vote, kin of two ‘bahubalis’ among them","As the Nitish Kumar government sailed through to a 129-0 majority in the trust vote on Monday after Opposition MLAs staged a walkout, three Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MLAs and one from the Janata Dal (United) grabbed the limelight.
While the RJD’s Sheohar MLA Chetan Anand, Mokama legislator Neelam Devi, and five-time Suryagarha MLA Prahlad Yadav cross-voted for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), the JD(U)’s Sitamarhi MLA Dilip Ray was the lone ruling alliance member to skip the floor test.
Chetan Anand (Sheohar MLA)
First-time MLA Chetan is the son of former MP and political strongman Anand Mohan. He contested the 2020 Assembly polls on an RJD ticket after being denied candidature by other parties. Speculation about him was rife after the Patna Police on Sunday night arrived at former Deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav’s residence following a missing person complaint filed by Chetan’s brother Anshuman Anand.Advertisement

Anand Mohan is said to have grown to close CM Nitish Kumar after the state government last year ordered his early release from jail, where he was lodged after being convicted in the lynching of former Gopalganj District Magistrate G Krishnaiah. After his release, the former MP invited Nitish to his village Panchgachiya in Saharsa district. Sources said either Anand Mohan or his wife Lovely could end up contesting the Lok Sabha seat. Despite the possibility of Chetan being disqualified from the Assembly, Anand Mohan is likely to take it in his stride for bettering his own political prospects.
Neelam Devi (Mokama MLA)
Neelam Devi is the wife of Mokama “bahubali” and former MLA Anant Singh. She was elected Mokama MLA on an RJD ticket in a 2022 bypoll necessitated by the conviction of her husband. Though she represented the RJD in the House, she was known for her inclination towards the NDA.
Neelam Devi unsuccessfully contested the Munger Lok Sabha seat in 2019 as a Congress candidate, losing to JD(U)’s Rajiv Ranjan Singh.
Prahlad Yadav (Suryagarha MLA)
The five-time MLA, according to sources, voted for the Nitish government due to his cordial relations with a senior JD(U) leader. Yadav, who has been in the sand business for a long time, began his political career with the Communist Party of India (CPI) after winning his first election as an Independent in 1995 and joined the RJD in 2000.Advertisement
Sources said the three MLAs believe that despite cross-voting they would remain legislators for the time being as disqualification proceedings, if initiated by the RJD, will take time to complete.
Meanwhile, JD(U) MLA Sudhanshu Ranjan on Monday evening filed a complaint against two persons for allegedly abducting Dilip Ray who was the sole JD(U) legislator to skip the trust vote. Ray was an RJD MLC and switched to the Nitish Kumar-led party ahead of the 2020 Assembly polls, which he won from Sitamarhi.",politics
"As its 2 UP MLAs make a pilgrimage to Ayodhya with Yogi, why Congress is a divided house","In early January, the Congress high command decided that three of its senior leaders — Sonia Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge, and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury — would skip the consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya later that month. Though the party did not issue a diktat against its party workers and leaders attending the event, the political fallout of the decision has seen it make concerted efforts since then to ensure it is not seen as “anti-Ram” even at the risk of isolating ally Samajwadi Party (SP) in Uttar Pradesh. And this has also left its state unit divided.
On Sunday, Congress MLAs Aradhna Mishra and Virendra Chaudhary were part of the delegation of UP legislators that visited Ayodhya along with CM Yogi Adityanath and his Deputy CMs Keshav Prasad Maurya and Brajesh Pathak. The SP chose to opt out of the visit.
Since deciding not to attend the January 22 consecration event, the Congress has justified its stand by claiming that “Ram belongs to all” and there should be no politics over faith. State Congress president Ajay Rai said the party leadership skipped the event as it was a mega show put up by one political party and had nothing to do with faith. “All of us have faith in Ram,” he said.Advertisement
Rai earlier told The Indian Express that prayers had been offered to Ram before the consecration. “Ram sabke hain. Humari bhi Bhagwan Ram mein aastha hai. (Lord Ram belongs to everyone. Even we have faith in Him). There must be no politics over it,” he said.
Elaborating on the reason for accepting Sunday’s invitation, Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Mishra said it was not a political visit. “We accepted the invitation of the Speaker and many (legislators) came with their families. It is a matter of faith and not politics,” she said.
Even as the Congress pushed back against the “anti-Ram” tag, the party is a divided house on the issue of the Ayodhya trip, with a section of leaders wanting it to focus more on minority and Dalit votes. Some leaders claimed that the SP would gain an upper hand among minorities if the Congress tried to “follow the ruling party (BJP)”.
A senior Congress leader said, “On one hand, we bring leaders like Imran Masood to convince minority communities that we will fight for their rights while, on the other hand, we are falling into the ruling party’s trap. We undertake temple visits and to balance them, we go to dargahs and mosques ahead of the elections. We need to be more clear about our agenda or we stand the risk of giving them (SP) the upper hand.”Advertisement
The SP claimed the Congress MLAs’ visit to Ayodhya was their choice and would not affect them. “Our party chief (Akhilesh Yadav) has said he will visit Ayodhya later with his family and party leaders are with him. It is up to the Congress what they want to do. Their stand does not affect us,” said SP leader Rajendra Chaudhary.
Meanwhile, sources said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was likely to visit the Kashi Vishwanath Temple and the ancient Kal Bhairav Temple during his Bharat Nyay Jodo Yatra, which will enter Uttar Pradesh from Chandauli district on February 16 and would arrive in Varanasi the following day.",politics
"As Ashok Chavan quits Congress, a look at the three cases pending against him","Former Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan who quit the Congress on Monday has been named in three cases in recent years.
Two of these are linked to the Adarsh Cooperative Housing Society case dating back to 2011 — one filed by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the second by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). With a Supreme Court stay on the proceedings since 2018, the trial in the CBI case has yet to begin. The ED, meanwhile neither made any arrests in its case nor filed a chargesheet.
The third is a case of alleged land grab filed against 15 people, including Chavan, in Yavatmal. Here too, there has been no progress for many years. The ACB filed an FIR in 2011 on various charges, including cheating, criminal conspiracy, and forgery under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The initial list of suspects in the case contained 13 names, including that of the former CM.
Adarsh casesAdvertisement
In the case filed by the ACB, the CBI began an inquiry after it received a complaint from the Ministry of Defence alleging that land in Colaba was illegally allotted for the Adarsh Cooperative Housing Society through the abuse of public positions and fabrication of documents. The FIR alleged Chavan was the Revenue Minister of the state in 2000 and entered into a conspiracy with other accused and proposed to add civilians as members in the society “with an ulterior motive”.

The society was first proposed to be for those in the defence forces or their kin. Chavan had to step down as Chief Minister in 2010 following the allegations. He, however, contested the claims and denied any favours were made nor illegal steps were taken to grant clearances to the society.
In a relief to Chavan, on December 22, 2017, a Division Bench of Justices Ranjit V More and Sadhana S Jadhav quashed and set aside an order passed by then Maharashtra Governor C Vidyasagar Rao granting sanction to the CBI to prosecute the former CM in the Adarsh Housing Society scam case. It held that the order by the then Governor “cannot be sustained” and “entertained at a pre-trial stage since the same was passed without there being a fresh material”.
The CBI in 2018 appealed this order in the Supreme Court, which is still pending. In separate proceedings, Chavan had earlier also applied for his name to be deleted from the case before the trial court — it rejected the plea in 2014. Separate pleas by Chavan appealing the order were also rejected by the High Court in 2014 and 2015. He then approached the Supreme Court. In January 2018, the SC Bench of Justices J Chelameswar and S K Kaul stayed proceedings in the CBI case pending before a special judge in Mumbai. The stay is still in place and no progress has been made in the case. The court has yet to take cognizance of the chargesheet filed by the CBI.Advertisement

The ED, too, filed a case in 2012 under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. No arrests were made in the case and no chargesheet was filed. On April 29, 2016, the High Court ordered the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) to immediately demolish the 31-storey building. The Bench directed the Centre and state government to consider initiating appropriate civil or criminal proceedings against the concerned bureaucrats, ministers and politicians as per law, “for committing various offences in acquiring the subject plot as also misuse and/or abuse of powers”.
On a request made by the Adarsh Housing Society, the Bench, however, stayed its order for 12 weeks to enable an appeal to be filed before the Supreme Court. The SC in July 2016 refused interim relief to the housing society and asked the Directorate of Military Estate of the Centre to take possession of the land and the building till the pendency of the appeals, which are not yet decided. The Centre assured there would be no demolition till the apex court decided the controversy.
Yavatmal case
In the case filed in Yavatmal, on June 26, 2015, a Division Bench of Justices A B Chaudhari and P N Deshmukh of the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court dismissed the petition by Chavan and others in a case of alleged encroachment by the Jawaharlal Darda Education Society on an open public space in Yavatmal.
The Bench dismissed a criminal application by Chavan and others challenging the verdict of the Chief Judicial Magistrate of Yavatmal who ruled the encroachments as illegal. The magistrate also ordered FIRs to be filed, as sought by an RTI activist.Advertisement

As per the complaint, the education society constructed an English medium school and a huge compound wall in the early 1990s on about 1,000 square metres of land that belonged to plot owners of the area for public utility.
The High Court held that a probe must be carried out since it had been delayed for about four years. Noting that the applicants were “highly influential persons”, the court asked the state Home Department to appoint a high-level officer to supervise the probe and complete it within four months. It noted, “The applicants have procrastinated the investigation for all these years without any justification. God only knows when the entire encroachment will be removed to give respite to these common people.”

"Ashok Chavan latest blow, unease grows in Congress over BJP’s blitz, Rahul Yatra timing","As the Lok Sabha elections draw near, the challenges before the Congress and the INDIA bloc are mounting. The latest setback came Monday, with senior Maharashtra leader Ashok Chavan leaving the party – coming on the heels of the JD(U) and RLD walking out of the INDIA coalition, the Trinamool Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) announcing that they would go it alone in West Bengal and Punjab; and seat-sharing talks in Delhi coming under severe strain.
Chavan has become the ninth former chief minister of the Congress to leave the party in the past 10 years, joining the ranks of Amarinder Singh (Punjab), Ghulam Nabi Azad (Jammu and Kashmir), Vijay Bahuguna (Uttarakhand), the late Ajit Jogi (Chhattisgarh), S M Krishna (Karnataka), Narayan Rane (Maharashtra) and Giridhar Gamang (Odisha). (Gamang returned to the party recently.)
Chavan’s resignation had been coming for a while, as he was known to be sulking. What many in the Congress expressed surprise over was the lack of efforts on the part of the high command to placate him. Sources said that at least a month ago, AICC in-charge of Maharashtra Ramesh Chennithala flagged to the leadership that some leaders against whom there are cases were “facing pressure” to quit, and that the activities of such leaders should be monitored.Advertisement
Read | Scion of old Congress family and ex-Maharashtra CM, Ashok Chavan now leaves party
On Monday, as Chavan exited the party, the Congress chose to lay the blame on his and the BJP’s doors, suggesting that the cases against him were the motivating factor.
But, behind the scenes, the party is bracing for more trouble, with apprehension rife that some MLAs close to the ex-CM (sources put their number at half-a-dozen) could quit and potentially spoil the Congress’s chances of winning a Rajya Sabha seat from the state in elections later this month.
Chennithala, who came to Delhi after the weekend in Maharashtra, is rushing back to Mumbai to meet senior leaders. The party has begun reaching out to all its MLAs. “How can we predict what they plan to do? After all, Chavan himself attended a meeting with Chennithala on Sunday,” a senior leader said.
Officially, Chennithala maintained: “Chavan’s exit will not affect the Congress.”Advertisement
Former Maharashtra CM Prithviraj Chavan said: “I do not think anyone from the Congress will follow Ashok Chavan. The party is holding a meeting with all its MLAs in Mumbai on Tuesday to review the situation.”
Congress leaders also admitted in private that the BJP design to “systematically” break up the INDIA bloc and force desertions from the party was clear. Chavan’s exit came days after two other Congress leaders from Maharashtra – Baba Siddique and Milind Deora – quit, and the apprehension is that the BJP is succeeding in conveying the perception of an INDIA bloc in tatters and a Congress that is isolated.
In what is seen as a conscious strategy, the BJP has toned down its attack against the INDIA bloc, which it once dubbed ‘Ghamandiya (arrogant)’ and ‘INDI’ alliance, and is focusing on the Congress.
“Mamata Banerjee’s announcement that her party would contest on its own came just before Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra was to enter Bengal. Then came Nitish Kumar’s exit from the INDIA alliance, the arrest of JMM leader Hemant Soren and the RLD’s decision to walk out in Uttar Pradesh. We are expecting some desertions in Madhya Pradesh as well (where the Yatra is headed),” a senior leader said, adding that the NDA “is not on a strong wicket in Maharashtra” and hence the bid to break the Opposition parties.Advertisement
Read | MLAs reaffirm their commitment as Congress tries to put up united front
Sources also said the BJP was using pressure tactics such as ongoing probes by investigating agencies to throttle the INDIA alliance. Chavan is believed to have approached the party leadership over this as recently as Saturday, while a leader pointed to the Enforcement Directorate summons to National Conference president Farooq Abdullah for Tuesday, just when the party and Congress are “in advanced stages of finalising seat-sharing”.
Another Congress leader claimed that the BJP was also at work to ensure that the alliance of the party with the AAP in Delhi does not happen.
UP too has not been good going. Even before the RLD shock came, the Congress was taken by surprise at the SP’s unilateral decision to announce 11 seats for it, and declare its own candidates in 16 seats. “In the end, we may end up with seat-sharing pacts in only states like Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Maharashtra and Jharkhand, where we were part of alliances even before the formation of the INDIA bloc,” one leader said.
Read | Future of Congress in Nanded Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha polls now on shaky ground
More and more Congress leaders now are raising questions about the timing of the Rahul Yatra. “It was ill-advised strategically. Had the party consulted the veterans… we would have said no. Just sit on the laurels of the earlier Yatra, focus on coordination with INDIA parties, organise big joint rallies in state capitals… at least one a week… that would have had far more impact,” a leader said.Advertisement
Another leader countered this, saying: “Rahul’s plan to embark on a second yatra came up for discussion at the December 21 CWC meeting and almost every leader asked him to go ahead.”
As things stand, the Yatra is on till next month, concluding in Mumbai, and the party fears the exit of MLAs and allies is all bad optics.
In the official reaction to Chavan’s exit, Congress communications head Jairam Ramesh said: “When friends and colleagues leave a political party that has given them much – perhaps much more than they deserved – it is always a matter of anguish. But to those who are vulnerable, THAT Washing Machine will always prove more attractive than ideological commitment or personal loyalties. These betrayers don’t realise that their exit opens up vast new opportunities to those whose growth they have always stunted.”",politics
"Easy win for Nitish govt in trust vote as 3 RJD MLAs, ‘missing’ JD(U) MLAs surface on his side","THREE RJD MLAs crossed over to the NDA while five absent JD(U) MLAs turned up with just a few minutes to go for voting, helping Chief Minister Nitish Kumar win the trust vote easily on Monday with 129 votes in its favour. There was no vote against, as the Opposition walked out before the voting.
The NDA’s tally stood at 130, if the Deputy Speaker’s vote was included. In the House of 243, simple majority is 122. Before the vote, the NDA claimed it had 128 MLAs with it (BJP: 78; JD-U: 45; HAM-S: 4; and Independent: 1), and the Mahagathbandhan cited the support of 114 (RJD: 79; Congress: 19; CPI ML-Liberation: 12; CPI: 2; CPI-M: 2).
In a speech that sought to make up for the lack of numbers, Tejashwi Yadav led the attack from the Opposition side. He said the fact that the ruling alliance had to make three RJD MLAs “cross over” to the NDA to prove its majority was a “moral victory” for the party.Advertisement
In his rebuttal, Nitish, among other things, accused the RJD of doing “too much Hindu-Muslim politics”.
Must Read  | Ahead of trust vote, Bihar numbers in fine balance; but what will Jitan Ram Manjhi do?
The government of Nitish Kumar was seen as jittery till just before the trust vote, as the no-confidence motion against Speaker Awadh Bihari Choudhary of the RJD that preceded it saw five JD(U) MLAs absent. But then, three RJD MLAs – Prahlad Yadav, Neelam Devi and Chetan Anand — crossed over to the Treasury Benches, amidst loud cheers from NDA legislators.
Choudhary was eventually voted out, with 125 MLAs of the NDA against, and 112 of the Mahagathbandhan in his favour, including the lone AIMIM MLA.
With this vote showing that the Nitish government was set to win his trust vote, four of the five missing JD(U) MLAs turned up; the only exception was Dilip Rai.Advertisement
Having voted as per the party whip, the four JD(U) MLAs escaped disqualification from the House. The three RJD legislators who changed sides, however, may face disqualification proceedings.

Replying to Tejashwi’s charge on the NDA wooing RJD MLAs, senior BJP leader and Deputy CM Samrat Choudhary said it was the RJD that had tried to “influence its (the BJP’s) five MLAs”. “We will bring them to book,” he said, “but you (the RJD) tried to hold them back from attending the House.” He did not identify who these MLAs were.
The JD(U) earlier alleged that the RJD had tried to influence six of its MLAs.
In veiled barbs against Nitish, Tejashwi said: “I congratulate Nitish Kumar for taking oath as CM for a record ninth time, including three times in his current ongoing term. But I want to know what your constraints were… You said, ‘Yahan man nahin lag raha tha (You were not comfortable with us)’. But were we with you to just do a song and dance for you?”Advertisement
Tejashwi claimed that he was against forming a government with Nitish in 2022 – when the JD(U) leader came over to the Mahagathbandhan after quitting the NDA – and wanted at best to lend outside support.

“But there was pressure from national leaders, more so because you announced you would fight Narendra Modi. You led the campaign (against the BJP), and if the BJP was very worried about any state, it was Bihar. It was because of our coming together and your presence. But now that you are with them, your bhatija (nephew, referring to himself) will take up the job. We have Congress and Left parties with us,” the RJD leader said.
Drawing on the Ramayana, Tejashwi added that he still saw Nitish as his Dashrath (or father figure), and it was on the JD(U) chief to identify his Kaikeyi (the one misleading him). Continuing in the same vein, he added: “I am not taking exile as Dashrath gave to Lord Ram, but I am going to the people.”
Nitish, who listened attentively to his former deputy, accused RJD leaders of corruption. “Lakhon-laakh kamaa rahe the (They were minting lakhs of rupees). I will institute a probe into it,” he said.Advertisement
Attacking the RJD government led by Lalu Prasad, before he became CM, Nitish said: “I have been working since 2005. Before that, your party had 15 long years to rule. What could you do? People were afraid to even step out of their houses.”
Significantly, Nitish also accused the RJD of communal politics. “There used to be issues because of too much of Hindu-Muslim politics from your side. You (the RJD) thought the Muslims would vote for you. It was left to me to control it when I took over as CM.”
On Tejashwi’s attempt to take credit for measures taken by the Mahagathbandhan government, particularly on filling up government posts, Nitish said they were his decisions, and he left the alliance on realising the RJD was messing them up.

“I gave you two chances – Saat Nischay I and Saat Nischay II were my ideas. You endorsed them. You forcibly took the Education Department, but you started doing gadbad (wrong things). The mass appointment of teachers was a decision taken before the RJD was given the ministry. I came to learn later that you people were not doing well and hence parted ways,” the CM said.Advertisement
Another reason for his disenchantment with the INDIA bloc was the realisation that the RJD may “betray” him, Nitish added. “I got to learn that (RJD supremo) Lalu Prasad along with the Congress had started working against me… I held its (INDIA’s) first meeting and got several parties together. I was given the job of talking to six parties, which I did. I was also in favour of giving the Congress more ministries in Bihar, as they had 19 MLAs… People used to keep asking me if things were moving (in the INDIA bloc). ‘Kuchch hua ji (Is anything happening)?’… When nothing did, I came back to my old place (in the NDA) and will stay here now.”
Samrat Choudhary also referred to the corruption charges against Lalu and family, including Tejashwi, asking the latter how he had amassed so much wealth at his age. “I advise you not to blame the CBI. It was during your alliance government at the Centre that the CBI arrested Lalu Prasad in the fodder cases.”",politics
"As Jayant makes NDA switch official, a history of RLD’s U-turns: BJP to SP and now back to BJP","After days of speculation, on Monday, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Jayant Chaudhary announced that his party was quitting the INDIA alliance of Opposition parties and joining the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA).
This partnership will help the BJP consolidate its base among Jats, who are the RLD’s core base, and place it ahead in at least seven seats in west UP where its prospects were considered grim as per ground surveys done by the party ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. Over the decades, the RLD, which enjoys significant support among Jats in west UP, has allied with the BJP, the Samajwadi Party (SP), and the Congress for political survival. The alliance with the BJP, thus, was never out of the realm of possibility.
Chaudhary Ajit Singh, who went on to become a seven-time MP, formed the RLD in 1997 to build on the legacy of his father and former PM Chaudhary Charan Singh, a stalwart farmer leader. During his tenure as UP Chief Minister, Charan Singh had pushed through major legislation that transformed the state’s agricultural economy. These land reform laws helped him develop a strong base among farmers in the region.Advertisement

Before he started the RLD, Ajit played a role in the Union government as part of various governments. In December 1989, Ajit, then with the Janata Dal, became the Union Cabinet Minister for Industry in the National Front government of V P Singh. He was re-elected as a Janata Dal MP in 1991. That year, a Congress-led alliance came to power under Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao. Ajit was subsequently appointed Union Cabinet Minister of the Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution in February 1995.
A year later, Ajit switched to the Congress. He contested the 1996 Lok Sabha polls on a Congress ticket and won. He then left the Congress to form the Bharatiya Kisan Kamgar Party (BKKP) to represent farmers’ interests. This eventually became the RLD in 1997. Two years later, he contested the Lok Sabha polls on an RLD symbol. In July 2001, he joined the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government and became the Union Agriculture Minister
The party allied with the BJP in the 2002 UP Assembly polls, winning 14 of the 38 seats it contested. This has been its best performance in the state elections to date. But in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the RLD partnered with the SP to consolidate OBC votes. The RLD won three of the ten seats it contested.

In 2011, the RLD joined the UPA-II government led by the Congress and Ajit became the Union Civil Aviation minister. The following year, the RLD contested the 46 seats in the UP Assembly polls in alliance with the Congress but won only nine constituencies. Two years later, in the 2014 parliamentary polls, the RLD contested again in alliance with the Congress. It fought in eight seats but lost all.Advertisement
The party fought the 2017 UP Assembly polls on its own — the SP and the Congress were in alliance at the time — and won only one seat. In 2019, it partnered with the SP and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) but lost all the three parliamentary seats it contested. In the 2022 state polls, it again contested with the SP.
The SP won 111 seats of the 347 it contested while the RLD won nine seats of the 33 where it fielded candidates. It clinched another seat by winning a bypoll the same year.",politics
"BJP bullish on Modi govt 3.0, rhetoric shows that with reforms, Hindutva to remain on agendaPremium Story","The 17th Lok Sabha came to a close last Saturday with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) exuding confidence about pulling off a hat-trick in the upcoming general elections. Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted that his party would clinch the Lok Sabha polls with an enhanced majority.
PM Modi also told the House, “Our third term will witness very big decisions, and will lay a strong foundation for the next 1,000 years.” His statement foreshadows the bold agenda the “Modi government 3.0” is likely to take up during its tenure.
Also Read | Express View on Modi’s speeches in Parliament: The gloves are off
The 17th Lok Sabha had been no less eventful as it saw some major ideological projects of the BJP reaching conclusion. This started with the abrogation of Article 370 that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir – which the BJP planned and executed meticulously – criminalisation of triple talaq and the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in 2019 itself, the first year of the Modi government 2.0.Advertisement
Although the Covid-19 pandemic that broke out in early 2020 slowed down some of its proposed projects, the BJP government stepped up its legislative reform moves in its final year. It passed the constitutional amendment legislation to grant 33% reservation to women in the Lok Sabha and Assemblies besides passing three Bills aimed at revamping the country’s criminal justice system — the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, and Bharatiya Sakshya Bill – which replaced the colonial-era Indian Penal Code, Code of Criminal Procedure, and Indian Evidence Act, respectively. The party mixed these legislative measures with political messages.
The BJP faced electoral or political setbacks in Maharashtra, Bihar – in both these states it regained upper hand after ensuring a political realignment – West Bengal, Kerala, Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana, but they were overshadowed by its resounding triumphs in Hindi heartland states, including Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pardesh and Rajasthan.
The BJP suffered setbacks on the CAA – which had sparked widespread protests across the country, culminating in riots in the national capital – and over the farm Bills, which it had to repeal, but the party has also managed to fight that back by raising its pitch on ideological issues. Its numerical supremacy means the BJP does not have to dilute its hardline stance on this.
The BJP dispensation has also not run into any major judicial roadblock. The Supreme Court Constitution Bench’s unanimous judgment in the Ayodhya matter led to the construction of the Ram Temple, which is likely to yield long-term political capital for the party.Advertisement
Significantly, the BJP has managed to push all its legislative measures through even in the Rajya Sabha despite not having a majority in the Upper House.
Now, the party has started rolling out its Uniform Civil Code (UCC) agenda, one of its earliest core ideological issues along with Article 370, going back to its Jana Sangh days. After the Uttarakhand Assembly recently clearing the UCC Bill, it is set to be introduced by other BJP-ruled states.
The BJP top brass has been claiming that the Modi government 3.0 would focus on major reforms to “lay the foundation for India’s glory for a millenium”. At the same time, the last session of the 17th Lok Sabha ended with the incumbent party sounding the bugle of Hindutva to set the tone for the elections. The Chairs of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha praised PM Modi for playing an “unparalleled role” in uniting the entire nation on the “auspicious occasion” of the Ram Temple’s consecration, which was discussed by both Houses. The PM said the adoption of a resolution on it will give constitutional strength to the future generations to feel proud of the country’s values.
Several BJP leaders admit that the party would not slow down on its Hindutva push even if it returns to power with 370 seats – the target set by PM Modi. The pitch from its core base would significantly determine the party’s roadmap, which has already started raising the slogan, “Ayodhya taiyar hai, ab ki baar Kashi Mathura (Ayodhya is done, it is the turn of Kashi and Mathura now)”.Advertisement

"Boost for BJP in J&K, days after Bill, Pahari face and ex-NC leader joins party","IN A SHOT in the arm for the BJP in Jammu and Kashmir ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, former MLC and prominent Pahari leader Shahnaz Ganai from Poonch district joined the party in Delhi, in the presence of Union minister Jitendra Singh and MP Tarun Chugh.
The move comes just days after Parliament passed a Bill granting Scheduled Tribe status to the Pahari ethnic tribe predominantly based in the Pir Panjal region, comprising Rajouri and Poonch districts.
Ganai had welcomed the move, thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the J&K Scheduled Tribes Amendment Act, saying it will “pull oppressed Paharis out of the clutches of oppressors”.Advertisement
Ganai follows in the footsteps of other prominent Pahari leaders to have joined the BJP recently, including Abdul Qayoom Mir and Iqbal Malik. Sources said others too may be crossing over to the party in the coming days.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah had first promised the Paharis ST status. Getting their support can help the BJP offset the anger among the Gujjars and Bakerwals, who fear that the expansion of the ST umbrella will dilute the benefits enjoyed by them, particularly just when the quota has been extended to Assembly seats for the first time in J&K.
The daughter of deceased NC leader and former minister Ghulam Ahmed Ganai, Shahnaz Ganai hails from Mandi area of Poonch and was elected to the Legislative Council against the panchayat quota in 2013, completing her term in 2018. It was the first time a woman doctor had become a legislator in the erstwhile J&K state.
Having made her name as an outspoken leader and staunch campaigner of women rights, Ganai resigned from the NC in July 2019, ahead of the 2020 elections to the newly floated District Development Councils in J&K. Contesting as an Independent, Ganai lost to the NC’s Ateeqa Jan.Advertisement
The other prominent Pahari leaders to join the BJP, Mir and Malik, are both members of the Rajouri District Development Board.

Another Pahari leader expected to join the BJP is former minister Mushtaq Bukhari, who resigned from the NC in February 2022, citing its “non-support” to the demand of Paharis for ST quota. He had also said that he would join the BJP if it ensured the same for Paharis.
The move to reserve Assembly seats for STs is expected to have the maximum impact in the Anantnang Lok Sabha constituency, which after delimitation includes six of the seven Assembly segments of Rajouri and Poonch districts. Of these six falling in the two districts, five are now reserved.
Earlier, the BJP’s efforts to woo the Gujjars and Bakerwals, including through political reservation, also won the party the support of senior leaders from the two communities. Earlier this month, a two-time former NC MLC and prominent Gujjar leader Haji Mohmmad Hussain joined it.Advertisement
If the ST quota move helps the BJP win Anantnag, it would be the party’s first victory in the Kashmir province.
Census 2011 put the Gujjar and Bakerwal population, which is predominantly Muslim, at 43% in Poonch district and at 41% in Rajouri. The remaining population in both the districts, including Hindus and Muslims, calls itself Pahari. With a population of nearly 18 lakh, the Gujjars and Bakerwals outnumber by far the other groups now under ST, who together number less than 2 lakh.
The Gujjars and Bakerwals, along with Shinas (Shin and Dard), Gaddi and Sippis, got ST status in 1991. This entitles them to 10% quota in government jobs and admissions to educational institutions (including professional colleges).

Till Article 370 was abrogated, benefits and protections under the Forest Rights Act, SC & ST Atrocities Act and Forest Conservation Act available to STs elsewhere were not extended to these nomadic communities in J&K.Advertisement
The abrogation on August 5, 2019, changed that, as well as provided political reservation for Gujjars and Bakerwals in J&K for the first time. Apart from five seats in Rajouri and Poonch, one constituency in Reasi and three in the Kashmir province are now reserved for STs.
Besides these nine constituencies, the Gujjars and Bakerwals form substantial numbers to tilt the scales in over a dozen Assembly seats.
The BJP government at the Centre and the J&K administration have promised the two ST groups that the 10% quota for them in government jobs and educational institutions in J&K would not be affected, and the Paharis would be accommodated with a separate quota.",politics
"Scion of old Congress family and ex-Maharashtra CM, Ashok Chavan now leaves party","THE DEFECTION of Ashok Shankarrao Chavan is a big blow to the Congress, already beset with the exit of several leaders and given his long lineage in the party.
A former Maharashtra chief minister, Chavan, 66, won his first election on the Congress ticket nearly 40 years ago, and is the son of Congress veteran Shankarrao Chavan, who served in senior positions in the party.
Sources said the BJP, which has been at work since it lost the 2019 Assembly polls in Maharashtra, and has already engineered defections in the NCP and Shiv Sena, also opened channels with Chavan around five years ago.Advertisement
Since then, several incidents involving Chavan have kept rumours of his probable exit alive. In June 2022, when cross-voting cost the Congress Rajya Sabha and Legislative Council seats, fingers had been pointed at Chavan.

A month later, the senior leader along with 11 MLAs close to him had not turned up for the trust vote sought by the BJP-Shinde Sena government, after toppling the government of NCP, Congress and Uddhav Sena. Chavan had claimed at the time that they had got caught in traffic and were not able to get to the Assembly on time.
Chavan is expected to join the BJP, though he insisted on Monday that he had not taken any call yet.
A former Maharashtra CM, Chavan came to the post in unfortunate circumstances, and later lost it in a similar situation.Advertisement
He was named by the Congress to the post in the wake of the 2008 terrorist strikes in Mumbai, leading to the exit of then CM Vilasrao Deshmukh. Many in the Congress were apprehensive that Chavan, a relative junior, would not be able to hold his own against ally NCP’s doyen Sharad Pawar, but Chavan had proved his critics wrong, quickly bringing both the administration and Congress under his control.

After the 2009 Assembly elections, when the Congress-NCP won, the NCP reportedly pushed back against Chavan being made CM, putting forward the name of Sushilkumar Shinde instead. However, AICC president Sonia Gandhi is believed to have prevailed and stuck with Chavan.
That tenure came to an abrupt end, though, due to the Adarsh Housing Society Scam. Accused of misusing his office to help kith and kin get flats under the Adarsh housing scheme meant for war veterans, Chavan had vehemently denied the charges and challenged them in court.
However, the high command asked him to step down, arguing that the allegations – at a time when the UPA government at the Centre was fighting a coordinated anti-corruption campaign – were hurting the party. The BJP also made the alleged Adarsh scam a poll issue in successive elections, with Devendra Fadnavis taking the lead.Advertisement
In another controversy, Chavan was questioned by the Election Commission over non-disclosure of poll expenditure related to advertisements in a Marathi daily.

Chavan finally stepped down on November 9, 2010, and was replaced by Prithviraj Chavan. After that, Ashok Chavan struggled to regain his stature in the party, despite his uncontested support base.
Following his father into politics, Chavan had his electoral debut from the Nanded Lok Sabha seat in 1987.
With his heart in Maharashtra politics, he returned to the state soon after, and in 1992, became an MLC, and later, Minister of State for Urban Development, PWD and Home. Under the Vilasrao Deshmukh-led government of Congress-NCP, Chavan was Minister of Transport, Cultural Affairs and Protocol.Advertisement
In 2004, Chavan was again made minister, this time with the important portfolios of Industries, Mining and Cultural Affairs.
A non-controversial, friendly leader, Chavan was seen as amenable to all in the party. If there were any issues, it were with fellow Maratha leader Deshmukh, whom he later replaced as CM. This was largely due to tussle between the two over control of the Marathwada region, to which both belonged. Deshmukh died in August 2012.
After his two short-lived CM stints, Chavan’s career got a boost when he won from the Nanded Lok Sabha seat amidst the 2014 Narendra Modi wave elections. The BJP’s prime ministerial candidate at the time, Modi himself campaigned in Nanded, but could not stop the Congress leader from winning.
In 2019, however, Chavan failed to retain the seat, losing to the BJP’s Pratap Patil Chikhlikar by 20,146 votes. He then contested the 2019 Assembly polls, and won from the Bhokar seat, which he had represented when he became CM in 2009.Advertisement
As per sources, the BJP was keen to get Chavan to its side because Nanded remains a tough seat for the party, as shown by its internal surveys as well. Then, of course, there is the psychological blow to the Congress.
Leaders talk of last year’s Ganesh festival as a crucial turning point, with Chavan and Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis coming face to face. Although both sides dismissed the meeting as apolitical, the process of mending fences began then, sources said.
In the wake of Monday’s development, many old-timers recalled how Chavan’s father Shankarrao Chavan, who also served as Maharashtra CM as well as Union Home Minister, was popularly called “Headmaster” for his uprightness, honesty and punctuality.
Others talked about the incongruity of Chavan joining hands with Fadnavis, the BJP leader who led the corruption allegations against him.Advertisement

Why an AAP-Congress alliance in Punjab made sense: 2022 Assembly poll numbers,"WITH NO parties seemingly willing to compromise, the Punjab Lok Sabha elections may see the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Congress, Akali Dal and BJP contesting separately, leaving four major contenders in the fray.
On the NDA front, renewal of the alliance between the BJP and Akali Dal has hit hurdles, while in the Opposition’s INDIA bloc, the AAP has declared it will contest alone, and put up candidates in all 13 Lok Sabha seats in Punjab and the Chandigarh seat. On Sunday, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge exhorted party leaders to win “all 12 seats in Punjab”.
Before they split over the farm laws issue, the Akali Dal and BJP had an understanding through their 25-year alliance, as part of which the former contested 10 of the 13 seats in Punjab, leaving Hoshiarpur, Gurdaspur, and Amritsar for the BJP. However, the equations have changed, with the Akali Dal no more the electoral force it used to be, and the BJP confident and demanding more seats.Advertisement
Political Pulse | Kejriwal pulls curtains on INDIA in Punjab, Chandigarh; says AAP will contest all 14 seats
An alliance between the AAP and Congress in Punjab was always going to be tricky given that they are the main rivals in the state as of now, though their tie-up in the Chandigarh mayoral polls managed to be a success. It’s another matter that the election is now caught in a legal challenge due to alleged rigging by the returning officer, helping the BJP win the mayor polls.
Since the AAP first contested in the Punjab Lok Sabha elections, after it was founded in 2012, all the four main parties have managed to win parliamentary seats in the state.
In the 2009 polls, the Congress bested the NDA, winning 8 seats and 45.2% of the vote share. While the Akali Dal won 4 of the 10 seats it contested with 33.9% of the vote share, the BJP won 1 of the 3 seats it contested with 10.1% of the vote share. That year, the Congress also won the Chandigarh seat.
The win was a boost for the Congress, coming two years after it lost the Assembly polls to the Akali Dal-BJP combine.Advertisement
 Lok Sabha seats won
Two years after the Akali-BJP combine again came to power in 2012, in a rare successive win for Punjab, the AAP made a strong debut in the 2014 Assembly polls, with 4 seats from 13 contested and 24.5% of the vote share. It cut votes of both the Congress and Akali Dal, with the parties ending up with considerably lower vote share than in 2009. While the Congress was reduced to 3 seats and 33.2% of the vote share, the Akali Dal’s seat tally remained unchanged at 4, but its vote share fell to 26.4%. The BJP, whose vote share fell to 8.8% (despite the Modi wave of the 2014 polls), managed to pick up an additional seat compared to 2009 and also won the Chandigarh seat by a wide margin.
 Punjab LS vote shares
In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections – which followed the 2017 strong win for the Congress in the Punjab state polls – the Congress won 8 seats of the total 13, and 40.6% of the vote. The Akali Dal and BJP won 2 seats each, with 27.8% and 9.7% of the vote share. The AAP, however, fell to just 1 seat and 7.5% of the vote share despite contesting all the 13 seats. Chandigarh saw a much closer fight than 2014, though the BJP still won with 51.1% of the vote share, ahead of the Congress at 40.7%.

A closer look at the 2019 results shows that the AAP played a decisive role in 4 seats, where it won more votes than the winning margin. In 3 seats, the AAP secured more votes than the margin between the runner-up Akali and the winning Congress. The Akali Dal won 1 seat where AAP votes exceeded the margin to runner-up Congress. In 8 seats though, where the AAP placed third or fourth, its votes did not make up the margin gap.
 Seat where AAP got more votes than the margin
In 2019, the NDA tie-up appeared to favour the BJP, which won the same number of seats as the Akali Dal, despite contesting only 3 seats and winning 9.7% of the overall vote share. The Akali Dal was the runner-up in 6 seats and finished third in 2.Advertisement
Had the AAP and Congress allied in 2019, a direct transfer of votes may have benefited the Congress in only 1 seat, going by how many votes the AAP secured compared to the margin. The Congress was the runner-up in the 5 seats it did not win.
But the AAP will draw comfort from its performance in the 2022 Assembly polls. It won 92 seats in the 117-seat Assembly, easily clearing the 57-seat majority mark, and secured 42.3% of the vote share. The Congress won 18 seats and 23.1% of the vote share to become the main Opposition in the Assembly. Both contested in all the 117 seats.
In the absence of an alliance in 2022, the Akali Dal and BJP struggled, winning 3 and 2 seats, respectively. While the Akali Dal got 18.5% of the vote share from the 97 seats it contested, the BJP managed 6.6% from 73 seats.
 2022 Assembly results
Looking at the 2022 Assembly results through the lens of the Assembly segments that make up the Lok Sabha constituencies, the AAP secured the most votes in 11 parliamentary seats, followed by the Congress in 2. Based on these figures, an AAP-Congress alliance could be formidable in the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls. While the Congress had the second-most votes in 6 seats, the Akali Dal was the runner-up in 5.Advertisement
The BJP’s impact was minimal, with less than 10% of the votes in 8 seats, with its highest vote share in Gurdaspur, where one of its 3 Punjab MPs is from, with 13.6%. The Akali Dal and BJP’s combined vote shares were not enough to lead in any seat.
However, the BJP is expected to do better this time, with the farm law agitation now a distant memory, and the Ram Temple consecration upsetting many calculations.",politics
Decode Politics: Why ST quota demand in Goa is gaining traction,"Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant last week said reservation for Scheduled Tribes (STs) in the Assembly will become a reality in the next state polls, scheduled for 2027.
Sawant, responding to a “calling attention” moved by Opposition MLAs, told the Assembly that his government had written to the Union Home Ministry and Law Ministry on February 7 to initiate the process of constituting a delimitation commission to identify and determine Assembly segments which would be reserved for the STs. The CM also said he would meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Union Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal in Delhi over the issue.
What is the issue and is it new?
Last week, members of the tribal community marched towards the Assembly demanding ST-reserved seats when they were stopped by the police, following which a government delegation met them. The STs in Goa enjoy reservation in elections at the panchayat, municipality and zilla parishad-level but not in the Assembly elections.Advertisement
Sawant’s assurance and the renewed focus on the issue come ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections after an umbrella group, Mission Political Reservation for STs of Goa, comprising 16 ST organisations, unanimously passed a resolution in May last year threatening to boycott polls if their demand was not met.
Also Read | How ‘Chinese’ is gobi manchurian, and why did a Goan fair ban it?
In July 2023, the issue also came up in the Assembly, which passed a private member’s resolution recommending reservations for STs in the House. “These communities (STs) deserve to be brought into the mainstream, need support to make the community more educated as well as empowered and hence need a larger political representation to achieve the same,” the resolution said.
On Saturday, Goa Forward Party (GFP) chief Vijay Sardesai said he would continue to strongly voice the long-standing and “justified” demand of the ST community. “The Union and state government’s feeble excuses and insincere promises are reflective of the ruling party’s habitual disregard for native Goans and their rights. I will not back down until the community’s privileges, accorded under the Constitution, are recognised and upheld,” he said in the House.
What is the political significance of STs in Goa?
The state has 40 Assembly constituencies, of which one (Pernem) is reserved for Scheduled Castes (SCs), which constitute 1.74% of the state’s population, according to the 2011 Census.Advertisement
Tribals, whose tally was 566 in the 2001 Census, increased to about 1.49 lakh in the 2011 Census after the Gawdas, Kunbis and Velips were granted ST status in 2003. They are known to have a significant presence in four Assembly constituencies – Quepem, Sanguem, Priol and Nuvem. However, none of the 40 seats is ST-reserved.

Priol falls under the North Goa Lok Sabha constituency, held by the BJP’s Shripad Yesso Naik, while Quepem, Sanguem and Nuvem fall under the South Goa Lok Sabha seat represented by Francisco Sardinha of the Congress.
What does the state government say?
Sawant, after meeting a delegation of community leaders on February 5, voiced his support for their demand. “It is my view that STs must be given political reservation… We are trying to constitute a delimitation commission before the 2024 Lok Sabha polls,” he said.
Last week in the Assembly, the CM reasoned why their demand has not yet been met. “In 2001, the ST population in Goa was 566 and this was considered by the delimitation commission. Hence, no Assembly constituency was reserved for them,” he said.Advertisement
This is not the first time that the Goa government has taken steps to grant political reservation to the STs. In May 2023, the Directorate of Tribal Welfare had written to the Union Law Ministry urging it to constitute a panel to look into the demand.

“Article 330 and Article 332 of the Constitution of India provide for reservation of seats for SC/ST respectively in the House of People and Legislative Assembly of State in proportion of their population… As per the Census of 2011, out of 40 Assembly constituencies, four constituencies need to be reserved for ST communities and one for SC community,” the letter read.
The ministry reverted two months later and, while denying the state government’s request, said Articles 82 and 170 (2) and the explanation to Article 330 read with Article 332 of the Constitution provide that readjustment of seats in the Assembly would not be necessary until relevant figures for the first census after 2026 have been published. “Therefore… the number of seats to be reserved for the SCs and STs would only take place by a delimitation commission to be constituted for the purpose after the relevant figures of the Census taken after the year 2026 are published,” it said.
Have there been controversies over the issue?
In October 2023, Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Ramdas Athawale kicked up a row after he claimed that STs cannot get reservation in the Assembly as “they make up a very small percentage of Goa’s population”.Advertisement
Following a backlash from the community, he apologised, claiming he was not aware that they make up around 12% of the state’s population. “Neither workers nor mediapersons brought the mistake to my notice. I support the demand for four ST-reserved seats in the Assembly. As a minister, I will also try to get the reservation approved,” he had said in October last year.
What do the STs say?
Mission Political Reservation for STs of Goa claims the lack of political will has deprived the community of their Constitutional rights despite a two-decade old demand for political reservation.
The Secretary of the umbrella organisation, Rupesh Velip, said Goa is perhaps the only state in the country where there are no Assembly seats reserved for the STs. “The estimated population of STs in the state is around 12%. The ‘double-engine government’ has no political will or lacks coordination. We will hold meetings in 300 villages, where there is a significant ST population, and then decide on the future course of action,” he said.
Velip said the CM’s “assurance” was not satisfactory and politicians in the past too have made similar assurances without taking any concrete steps on the issue. “In 2012, following a state-wide agitation, the tribal community voted overwhelmingly in favour of the BJP. But our demands have been brushed under the carpet. Elected representatives have become party loyalists and failed to raise the community’s concerns. Several issues concerning the communities can be addressed only representatives are elected to the Assembly from reserved seats,” the leader said.Advertisement
He also questioned why the government was not bringing an ordinance in Goa on the lines of Jammu and Kashmir to grant political reservation to STs. “We do not know when the Census will take place. By the time it happens, there is a likelihood that the demographics of the state would have undergone a significant change due to the influx of migrants,” he said.
The president of the body, Joao Fernandez, said the community remains optimistic about the CM’s forthcoming talks on the issue with leaders in Delhi. “Our immediate demand is the setting up of a delimitation commission, which can be done if there is political will. We will decide the future course of action based on the outcome of the meeting in Delhi,” he said.",politics
"BJP holds out hope for AIADMK’s NDA return, but Palaniswami unmoved","As the countdown to the Lok Sabha elections begins, the stage is set for a high-stakes chess game in Tamil Nadu. With the DMK’s secular alliance holding firm in the state, the Opposition’s strategy hinges on the AIADMK that exited the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) last September.
The BJP top brass in Delhi has not closed the door on the AIADMK’s return, keeping all players, including ousted AIADMK leaders O Panneerselvam and T T V Dhinakaran who are eyeing a comeback via the NDA, on tenterhooks. The AIADMK under its leader and former Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, however, continues to maintain its standoffish position.

Last week, Union Home Minister Amit Shah told a Tamil daily in an interview that the party’s doors were open to potential allies, signalling a willingness to take back the AIADMK in the NDA fold. The dispute between the two parties had worsened because of state BJP president K Annamalai who is currently on a statewide yatra. With Annamalai remaining the preferred choice of the BJP leadership, the AIADMK insists its position will not change. In response to Shah’s statement, AIADMK spokesperson D Jayakumar said, “Let the BJP keep their doors open, our doors are closed …”Advertisement
At a public meeting in Krishnagiri on Sunday, Palaniswami said there was no need for anyone to be curious about the AIADMK reuniting with the BJP, declaring the chapter closed last September. “I have said many times before. The AIADMK has made it clear in last September’s district secretaries meeting that it will not have an alliance with the BJP. We are not part of the NDA. Even after that, there has been a consistent campaign in the media that we are still talking to the BJP. Let me tell them again and again, we do not have an alliance with the BJP. Nobody needs to ask us about a BJP alliance hereafter,” he said.

Despite the public remarks by the AIADMK chief, top leaders in the BJP said the chapter was not completely closed yet. As J P Nadda arrived in Chennai on Sunday to attend a party event, party sources said OPS was among the leaders pushing for an audience with the BJP president. But BJP insiders said it was last on Nadda’s priority list. “The meeting has not been confirmed yet. He may or may not meet OPS,” said a senior BJP leader.
Another leader said Nadda was unlikely to meet OPS as the national leadership does not want to spoil any chance of bringing Palaniswami back into the NDA fold. “Even if a scenario emerges and Palaniswami agrees to join the NDA front, he will not do it if OPS and TTV are with us. So, we wouldn’t do anything that appears like we have already given shelter to OPS and TTV,” said the party functionary.

A senior RSS leader from Coimbatore told The Indian Express that although it seems unlikely, the BJP and RSS would keep trying to bring back the AIADMK. “Annamalai is the only BJP leader who stands against the AIADMK alliance. He is the sole problem, not others. After his ongoing statewide yatra, what if he is sent to Karnataka for election duty, and the senior leader Vanathi Srinivasan is made in charge of the state party here? If Annamalai, OPS, and TTV are out of the scene, it may open a chance for an alliance. We feel that it cannot be ruled out completely. Because EPS, even if stubborn, has reasons to consider the option of an NDA alliance,” said the Sangh leader.Advertisement
When asked about it, a former AIADMK minister insisted Palaniswami had made up his mind about not joining the NDA. “He doesn’t want to join as he fears losing his credibility if he returns to the NDA. He thinks his long-term future will be doomed. He also fears the same fate as parties in Maharashtra and Bihar if he goes unconditionally to the NDA. He wants to prove that the AIADMK is the prime Opposition party in the state. He is fully focused on building an alliance with the PMK and DMDK for the Lok Sabha polls now,” said the leader.

Longstanding NDA member PMK, a party backed by the powerful OBC-Vanniyar community, is also said to be considering quitting the alliance and joining hands with the AIADMK, with sources in the party saying they will continue with the BJP only if they are promised a Union Cabinet portfolio after the elections. If the PMK, led by S Ramadoss, allies with the AIADMK, it may receive the same offer as in 2019 — seven Lok Sabha seats and one Rajya Sabha seat. “Now that the five seats given to the BJP are vacant, we may be getting a few more seats from the AIADMK,” said a PMK leader.
Other than the PMK and DMDK, a probable AIADMK alliance, however, looks like one with bleak prospects as it may attract only smaller outfits such as the SDPI and Puratchi Bharatham.

The situation for both OPS and Dhinakaran looks even more desperate. Shut out of the political mainstream, OPS on Saturday claimed that “a mega alliance will be formed in Tamil Nadu to choose Narendra Modi as PM again”. But neither the former Deputy CM nor Dhinakarn bring much to the table for the BJP as they don’t have the political heft to win a single Lok Sabha seat on their own.",politics
"As SP gets ready to plug RLD-shaped hole in west UP, Congress may demand more seats","With the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) all set to join the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), its INDIA bloc ally Samajwadi Party (SP) will have a gap to fill in western Uttar Pradesh where the Jayant Chaudhary-led party enjoys the support of a significant section of the Jat community. The Jats constitute a sizeable chunk of the electorate in western UP districts such as Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Saharanpur, Aligarh, and Hapur.

While a section of SP leaders said the party leadership should promote other Jat leaders in the region in a bid to replace the vacuum that Jayant would leave, another group of party functionaries said the RLD’s exit would not affect the party in the region. Another consequence of the RLD’s exit will be the Congress demanding more seats during its negotiations with the Akhilesh Yadav-led party.
“Jayant ji did help us get the votes of the Jats who were against the BJP for issues like farmer protests, wrestler’s protests etc. But the Jat voter has been with the BJP for a while now and votes for the saffron party. Our party is going to lose some votes and we should try and fill that gap by promoting other Jat leaders in places where the community has influence. It is up to the central leadership of the party to identify such leaders and make them more prominent,” said an SP leader in Muzaffarnagar.Advertisement

An SP leader in Amroha district claimed Jayant’s exit would not affect the party. The reason, he explained, is that Jayant anyway brought only the anti-BJP vote to the SP and that will remain unaffected. “Those who are against the BJP will continue to vote for the Opposition. Jayant ji has some influence but not so much that he would be able to sway all the anti-BJP votes back to the ruling party,” said the SP functionary.
The RLD and the SP have been allies since the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Given the RLD’s performance in the last few elections, Akhilesh is not likely to worry much. The party lost all three seats it contested as part of the SP-BSP-RLD alliance in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, finishing second to the BJP in each. In Muzaffarnagar and Baghpat, the RLD gave the BJP a tough fight by securing 49.2% and 48.5% of the vote shares, respectively.
In the 2022 Assembly elections, the party could only win eight seats out of 33 it contested in alliance with the SP, winning just 2.9% of the overall vote share. It had a sizeable presence in the seats it contested though, winning 33.9% of the vote share. The RLD finished runner-up in 19 seats, losing by less than 10,000 votes in six of them.
SP national spokesperson Farazuddin Kidwai said the RLD’s exit would not affect the SP because the Jayant-led party had “compromised on its core ideology”, which is centred on farmers. “Why are so many farmers protesting during BJP rule? As we speak, the farmers are preparing for a protest in Delhi. So if Jayant ji has left the Opposition and abandoned the cause of farmers, it will impact his politics in the long run and it will have no impact on the SP,” he said.Advertisement
The BJP’s decision to bring the RLD on board would help it consolidate its support among Jats, who are the RLD’s core base, and place it ahead in at least seven seats in west UP, where its prospects were considered grim as per ground surveys done by the party ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.
With the Congress and the SP still working out their seat-sharing formula in UP, the former is expected to demand more seats in west UP. “The SP has so far finalised 11 seats for us, but that was because the SP leadership kept telling us that they also have to accommodate the RLD in western UP. But now with the RLD gone, we will demand more seats from the SP. They should at least give us Saharanpur and Amroha, where senior leaders Imran Masood and Danish Ali (formerly of the BSP) can contest for the Congress. There are other seats too where we should be getting the ticket as part of the alliance,” said a Congress leader.
Some SP leaders also agreed with the Congress’s demand for more seats in the region. “They do have these two Muslim leaders and Danish Ali sahab has become very big after recent developments. So, the central leadership in our party should ensure that senior Congress leaders from the Muslim community contest. It will also send a good message among Muslim voters for our party’s sake,” said an SP leader.",politics
Today in Politics: Will Jayant Chaudhary announce BJP deal on his father’s birth anniversary?,"It is the start of the week and we are in for a ride. Among the big political stories of the day will be the Bihar trust vote as Nitish Kumar, sworn in for the ninth time as CM on January 28, proves that his NDA government has the majority in the state Assembly.
After days of political intrigue that saw Speaker Awadh Bihari Choudhary refuse to step down, Congress MLAs flown to Hyderabad to be sequestered, BJP move its MLAs move to Bodh Gaya ostensibly for a “training camp”, and RJD MLAs and Left legislators stay put at former Deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav’s home over the weekend, Assembly proceedings will kick off at 11 am with Governor R V Arlekar’s address. It will be followed by the tabling of a no-confidence motion against Choudhary, who is most likely to step down before the motion can be put to vote, and then the vote on the confidence motion.
As the numbers stand, the NDA has six more MLAs than the halfway mark of 122 while the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan is eight short. Until and unless utter chaos unfolds, the Nitish Kumar government will sail through. But as the developments of the past few days, especially Sunday, showed, political circles in Patna are on the edge.Advertisement
Political Pulse | RLD deal ‘almost finalised’: What BJP has offered as Jayant Chaudhary inches closer to quitting INDIA bloc
On Sunday, Santosh Singh reported that there was fierce speculation around five JD(U) MLAs who skipped a legislature party meeting, and a missing person complaint filed by RJD MLA Chetan Anand’s brother Anshuman Anand. Chetan was at Tejashwi’s home and said he was there of his own volition. The arrival of the police at the former Deputy CM’s residence in connection with Anshuman’s complaint did not go down well with RJD workers camping outside.
Late at night, the RJD’s official handle posted on X, “Nitish Kumar, fearing the government, has sent thousands of police and surrounded Tejashwi ji’s residence from all sides. They want to enter the residence on any pretext and do untoward incidents with the MLAs. The people of Bihar are watching the misdeeds of Nitish Kumar and the police.
“Remember, we are not among those who fear and bow down. This is a struggle of ideology and we will fight it and win because the justice-loving people of Bihar will oppose this police repression. Jai Bihar! Jai Hind.”

When will RLD announce INDIA exit?
Another political story that has simmered right through last week and may reach a critical point on Monday is Jayant Chaudhary and the future of his Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD). The RLD will mark the birth anniversary of its founder and Jayant’s late father Chaudhary Ajit Singh on Monday and it is perhaps as good a day as any to announce that it will dump the INDIA bloc and the Samajwadi Party (SP) to join the BJP-led NDA.
Though the BJP has the firepower to win western UP without Jayant’s help, having him on its side is more than just winning a few extra constituencies that will push its tally over the 71 bagged in 2014. The RLD’s exit will likely hurt the SP and the INDIA alliance more than it will benefit the BJP. For the ruling party, the gain perhaps will be evaluated more in terms of the psychological blow it will deliver to the Opposition alliance and the Congress before the Lok Sabha elections.Advertisement
Political Pulse | RLD’s silence on meetings with BJP sets off speculation; spooks SP
But, as Asad Rehman reports, SP leaders in the region are defiant and say that the party can replace the RLD and should look to promote its own Jat leaders. It has to be seen if this sense of defiance translates into any concrete pushback against the BJP in west UP or if it is just wishful thinking.
Farmer leaders to meet Union Ministers
Farmers are again on the move. As the Delhi Police prepare for the “Delhi Chalo” march on February 13, the farmers’ unions that have called the protest march said they would take a final decision on whether to go ahead only after meeting Union Agriculture Minister Arjun Munda and his ministerial colleagues Piyush Goyal and Nityanand Rai in Chandigarh on Monday.
The unions, mostly from UP, Haryana, and Punjab, have called for the protest to demand a law guaranteeing Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops, one of the conditions they had set when they agreed to withdraw their protest in 2021. The march is being organised by around 200 farmers’ unions and a large number of farmers is expected to reach the national capital on Tuesday.
Also happening: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and his Punjab counterpart Bhagwant Mann will visit the Ayodhya Ram Temple on Monday. The AAP leaders will land at the Ayodhya airport around 11 am on a chartered flight from Delhi. They are likely to be accompanied by their families.Advertisement
While Kejriwal did not attend the temple consecration ceremony on January 22, the AAP organised a series of events in the national capital to celebrate the occasion, from organising Shobha Yatras to Sundar Kand recitals.

"Back with BJP, Nitish Kumar to face floor test today, oust Speaker","More than two weeks after he joined the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and took oath as Bihar Chief Minister for a ninth time, Nitish Kumar will face a floor test in the Bihar Assembly on Monday.
According to the Assembly schedule, the Budget session will commence with Governor R V Arlekar’s address to both Houses of the legislature. This will be followed by the Assembly taking up the no-confidence motion against Speaker Awadh Bihari Choudhary. Choudhary, who is from the RJD, has refused to step down despite calls from the BJP and the JD(U) and may resign before the motion is introduced. The RJD has dared Nitish to prove his majority before the no-confidence motion against the Speaker is taken up.
Bihar trust vote | Follow our live coverage
As things stand now, the NDA claims to have the support of 128 MLAs, six more than the halfway mark of 122 in the 243-member Assembly. The BJP has 78 MLAs, the JD(U) 45, the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) four, and one Independent. The Mahagathbandhan comprising the RJD, Congress, CPI(ML) Liberation, CPI and CPI(M) has 114 MLAs on its side. The Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM has one MLA.Advertisement
On Sunday, Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) faced some anxious moments as five of its MLAs skipped a meeting of the legislature party while alarm bells rang among Rashtriya Janata Dal’s (RJD) legislators — who were camping at the house of former Deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav along with Left MLAs — after one of them “went missing” for a brief period. Meanwhile, the legislators of the BJP and the Congress, sequestered in Bodh Gaya and Hyderabad respectively, returned to Patna in the evening.

State Parliamentary Affairs minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary who convened a meeting of the JD(U) legislature party downplayed the absence of “two or three MLAs”, attributing it to “unavoidable circumstances about which they had given prior information”. He emphasised that the absentees would be present in the Assembly on Monday. “We in the NDA have a total strength of 128 MLAs … we are comfortably placed. All our MLAs will be present inside the House where a no-confidence motion against the Speaker will precede the trust vote,” he said.

JD(U) national spokesperson Rajib Ranjan urged the media not to read too much into the MLAs missing the meeting. “They could not attend Sunday’s meeting due to some personal engagements. We will prove our majority but will remove Speaker Choudhary before that. This will answer all doubts of the Opposition,” he said.

Meanwhile, late on Sunday evening, the Pataliputra Police visited Tejashwi Yadav’s official residence after former party MP Anand Mohan’s son Anshuman Anand complained that his younger brother and Sheohar MLA Chetan Anand had gone missing. Chetan, who eventually arrived at Yadav’s residence, said he had come there voluntarily and the missing person complaint did not stand.Advertisement
An RJD insider alleged it was the JD(U)’s tactic to divert attention from their MLAs skipping the meeting. The RJD leader, however, did not rule out the possibility of Chetan rebelling, citing his father’s growing proximity to Nitish and the former MP’s desire to contest the Lok Sabha polls from Sheohar.
BJP spokesperson Santosh Pathak said the Opposition was “nervous” while the former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi reiterated that the four MLAs of his party HAM(S) would support the NDA.

"Congress to end Rahul yatra earlier than planned, skip most of west UP","The Uttar Pradesh leg of senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra will be curtailed by a few days, with party insiders saying the march is likely to culminate at least a week earlier than planned.
The yatra was scheduled to enter Uttar Pradesh this week and spend 11 days in the politically crucial state that has 80 Lok Sabha seats and where the Congress has failed to make a mark in the last two Lok Sabha elections.
In UP, the yatra was to pass through 28 Lok Sabha constituencies, among them Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s seat Varanasi, Rae Bareli, Amethi, Allahabad, Phulpur, and Lucknow. The original route included areas such as Chandauli, Varanasi, Jaunpur, Allahabad, Bhadohi, Pratapgarh, Amethi, Rae Bareli, Lucknow, Hardoi, Sitapur, Bareilly, Moradabad, Rampur, Sambal, Amroha, Aligarh, Badaun, Bulandshahr, and Agra.Advertisement

Sources said the yatra would now skip most of the western UP districts and travel directly from Lucknow to Aligarh and then to Agra, both in west UP, before entering Madhya Pradesh. Interestingly, the Congress’s INDIA bloc partner Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) that has a strong presence in west UP is in talks with the BJP to join the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).
Sources in the Congress, however, said the decision to curtail the yatra in UP had nothing to do with the political developments involving the RLD. “We wanted to slow down the yatra to ensure that Rahul Gandhi gets time for interactions with groups on the way,” said a party leader.

The yatra that was to culminate in Mumbai by March 20 may now end between March 10 and 14, at least a week earlier than planned as it will give more time for Gandhi to campaign for the Lok Sabha elections.
Sources said AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who has so far not joined the yatra, which will complete a month on February 14, might make an appearance when it enters UP.Advertisement
Sources also said that the INDIA bloc has decided to hold its first joint rally later this month in Karnataka. The alliance is facing turmoil after the exit of Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United), the Trinamool Congress and Aam Aadmi Party’s decisions to contest alone in West Bengal and Punjab, and is staring at the possible exit of RLD. The Congress will also invite all its INDIA partners to a rally marking the culmination of the yatra in Mumbai next month.",politics
"Newsmakers | TMC pulls a surprise with Sagarika Ghose in RS polls list, Matua leader too among nominees","The Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Sunday announced the names of four candidates for the Rajya Sabha elections from West Bengal on February 27. While the party nominated party leaders Sushmita Dev, Md Nadimul Haque and Mamata Bala Thakur, it sprang a surprise by announcing well-known journalist Sagarika Ghose as its nominee.
“We are pleased to announce the candidature of @sagarikaghose, @SushmitaDevAITC, @MdNadimulHaque6 and Mamata Bala Thakur for the forthcoming Rajya Sabha elections. We extend our heartfelt wishes to them and may they work towards upholding Trinamool’s enduring legacy of indomitable spirit and advocacy for the rights of every Indian,” the TMC said in a post on X.
According to the current strength of the West Bengal Assembly, four TMC candidates and one from the BJP will be elected to the Rajya Sabha. The TMC has 222 members in the Assembly while the BJP has 68. Others make up three seats, while one seat is vacant in the 294-member House.Advertisement
Mohammad Nadimul Haque
Haque is a two-time Rajya Sabha MP, having been sent to the Upper House of Parliament for the first time in 2012. A writer and journalist by profession, he is the owner of the Kolkata-based Urdu daily Akhbar-e-Mashriq. He was a member of the Rajbhasha Committee of the Railway Ministry between October 2009 and March 2012, a time when the TMC was in charge of the ministry. He also served as a member of the Passenger Services Committee.
Since 2011, when the TMC stormed to power in West Bengal, he has served as a member of various committees of the West Bengal government such as the Press Accreditation Committee and the West Bengal Minority Development & Finance Corporation, and has also served on the governing body of the Urdu Academy, the Mohammedan Burial Board of Kolkata Municipal Corporation, the Citizens Committee of Kolkata Police, and the Nazrul Academy.
Following his renomination, Haque expressed gratitude in a video message. “I thank my party for giving me this opportunity for the third time. I thank party supremo Mamata Banerjee and MP Abhishek Banerjee for giving me the opportunity to serve the people once more,” he said.
Sushmita Dev
Dev began her political career with the Congress and served as the president of the All India Mahila Congress. The daughter of veteran Congress leader and MP Santosh Mohan Dev and former Congress MLA from Silchar Bithika Dev, Sushmita represented the seat in the Assam Assembly from 2011 to 2014 before being elected to the Lok Sabha from the Silchar constituency that year. She lost the seat five years later to the BJP’s Rajdeep Roy.Advertisement
In 2021, ahead of the West Bengal Assembly polls, Sushmita quit the party and joined the TMC and was nominated to the Rajya Sabha.
Dev thanked her party chief and expressed gratitude to her for providing an opportunity to serve the people. “While there is a half-baked Women’s Reservation Bill in Parliament, Mamata di has walked the talk. We do not know when the reservation will be provided. She has consistently facilitated more and more representation in Parliament,” she said in a video message.
Mamata Bala Thakur
Thakur belongs to the electorally important Matua community and is the daughter-in-law of Binapani Devi Thakur, who was known as “Boro Maa (elder mother)”, the matriarch of the Matua Mahasangh. With this move, the TMC provides representation to the community that has a strong presence in the districts of North 24 Parganas and Nadia and is a crucial vote bank for both the ruling party and the BJP.
In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Binapani Devi’s eldest son Kapil Krishna Thakur was elected to the Lok Sabha from Bongaon. After Kapil’s sudden death in October 2014, a family feud ensued between his wife Mamata Bala and his brother Manjul who wanted his youngest son Subrata to get the ticket for the by-election from Bongaon. But the TMC picked Mamata Bala.Advertisement
Manjul quit as minister to join the BJP, which gave Subrata a ticket from Bongaon for the bypoll. However, Mamata Bala won the election and Subrata came third. Manjul returned to the TMC a few months later. In addition, the charge of party affairs in the area was handed over to Mamata Bala.
The family feud worsened after Binapani Devi’s death in March 2019 and two Matua Mahasangha factions emerged, one pro-TMC led by Mamata Bala and the other led by Shantanu Thakur, Manjul’s eldest son. Shantanu defeated his aunt in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and is now a Union Minister.
Sagarika Ghose
A first-time nominee to the Upper House, Ghose is a journalist and author with wide experience in covering politics. She has worked for prominent news publications such as The Times of India and The Indian Express, and the television media. The daughter of former Doordarshan director-general Bhaskar Ghose, she, like Derek O’Brien, will likely be the party’s voice in national media.
Ghose has authored biographies of former Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi and Atal Bihari Vajpayee and two novels, The Gin Drinkers and Blind Faith. In her 2018 non-fiction book Why I Am A Liberal: A Manifesto For Indians Who Believe in Individual Freedom, she argued that despite India being founded as a liberal democracy in 1947, governments had vastly increased their powers and attacked individual freedoms.Advertisement
Interestingly, in 2012, TMC chairperson Mamata Banerjee angrily stormed out of a television show hosted by Ghose after taking offence at a question asked by a college student in the audience.
In a Facebook post, Ghose expressed her happiness upon getting the party’s nomination. “Honoured and delighted to be nominated to the Rajya Sabha by the All India Trinamool Congress. I remain inspired by the courage and commitment of Mamata Banerjee,” she said.",politics
BJP in a bind as two allies stake claim to an LS seat in Maharashtra,"While the INDIA alliance of Opposition parties faces the prospects of allies walking out, the NDA in Maharashtra seems to be facing a problem of plenty as coalition partners Shiv Sena led by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and the Republican Party of India (Athawale) have staked claim to the Shirdi Lok Sabha seat.
While the CM has categorically said his party will not part with seats it won in 2019, RPI(A) chief Ramdas Athawale who belongs to the Dalit community has thrown his hat in the ring for Shirdi, which is reserved for the Scheduled Castes (SC). Shinde fears leaving the seat to allies may lead to massive unrest and defections ahead of the parliamentary polls.
“The RPI(A) is the constituent of the NDA. We have our electoral base in Maharashtra and I am keen to contest from the Shirdi Lok Sabha seat,” Athawale said last week. In response, a senior Cabinet minister from the Sena said each party in the coalition was entitled to contest the seats it holds and hence Shirdi was their right. “We have to accommodate our sitting MP who supported Shinde when the party split,” he said.Advertisement

Athawale’s party believes that contesting a couple of seats is necessary to keep its cadre motivated. Athawale was also reportedly eyeing one of the six Lok Sabha seats in Mumbai. However, his hopes were dashed when the BJP said it would contest four and leave the remaining for Shinde. With no chance for his party to contest in Mumbai, the RPI(A) chief is said to have set his eyes on Shirdi in Ahmednagar district.
The RPI(A) chief contested from Shirdi in 2009 but lost to the Shiv Sena’s Bhausaheb Wakchaure. After the defeat, he blamed the Congress for his loss, saying it did not support his candidature. He then quit the Congress-NCP alliance and joined the NDA ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and has been with it since.
The Sena has held Shirdi since 2009, with the coming elections set to see the Shiv Sena (UBT) also take on Shinde’s party for control of the constituency. Of the six Assembly segments in the constituency, two each are held by the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) of Ajit Pawar, and one each by the BJP and the Shiv Sena.
Why Athawale is important
RPI(A) insiders said Athawale would sail through as four of the six Assembly segments were held by the ruling alliance’s partners. At a time when the BJP has set an ambitious target of the NDA bagging at least 45 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra, Athawale’s dedicated vote bank will play a crucial role. Though his party does not have an MLA or a Lok Sabha MP, it has influence in at least 22 Lok Sabha constituencies.Advertisement

With two of its allies at loggerheads, state BJP president Chandrashekhar Bawankule said it was natural for every party to express its wish. “Ultimately, we have to take into account all aspects while accommodating the concerns of each party. Winnability is a major criterion which will be taken into account while deciding the seat-sharing formula,” he said.
Bawankule said the BJP’s role is to provide strength to its allies. “The final decision on who contests which seat will be a collective decision of the state leadership after consultation with the Centre,” he said.
Athawale has represented Pandharpur Lok Sabha seat (1999-2009) and Mumbai North Central (1998-1999). From 1990 to 1996, he was a member of the Maharashtra Legislative Council and a minister in the Congress-led Maharashtra government, holding key portfolios like social justice, transport, employment guarantee, and sports and youth welfare.
He was nominated as a member of the Rajya Sabha in 2014 by the BJP and was elevated to Union Minister of State for Social Justice in the Narendra Modi Cabinet in 2016. He held the same portfolio in the Modi government’s second term and was renominated to the Rajya Sabha in March 2020.",politics
"BJP-Akali backdoor talks fuel alliance whispers, but major hurdles remain on road to reconciliation","Although the break-up of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the BJP in 2020 amid the farm law protests was acrimonious, whispers of a reconciliation between the BJP and its oldest NDA ally have been floating since the Union government repealed the three contentious farm laws in 2021.
Now with the Lok Sabha polls approaching, once again there is buzz in Punjab about backdoor talks between the SAD and the BJP to revive their alliance. On Saturday, sources within both parties said a first round of talks between their leaders took place in the last week of January and another is likely to happen soon. Answering questions at the ET NOW Global Business Summit the same afternoon, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said, “We always want that our alliance grows and we always welcome new allies. Our ideology has remained the same since the days of Jan Sangh. Those who would like to join us can come.”
A senior BJP leader said, “Discussions about reviving the SAD-BJP alliance were being held internally when the AAP and the Congress were also holding alliance talks (which have collapsed). Can’t say anything more, except that many senior SAD leaders are ready to join the BJP.”Advertisement
The alliance talk in Punjab comes at a time when the BJP is said to be mulling over rejoining hands with its old southern ally Telugu Desam Party (TDP) of Chandrababu Naidu and has welcomed back Nitish Kumar of the Janata Dal (United) into the NDA fold. In Punjab, speculation about the former allies reuniting has emerged from time to time but there have not been any concrete developments yet. The reason is that there are major roadblocks that the BJP and the SAD have to overcome, given the changed political topography in the state.
Since being relieved of alliance responsibilities, the BJP has aggressively reached out to the state’s rural vote bank, especially in the Malwa region that once was an Akali stronghold. Throughout their 25-year alliance, the SAD contested 10 seats of the 13 in Punjab, leaving Hoshiarpur, Gurdaspur, and Amritsar to the BJP. The BJP is not expected to be satisfied with this arrangement anymore, especially given that the SAD is not the electoral force it used to be and the BJP has momentum with it ahead of the national polls.
BJP’s Punjab in-charge Vijay Rupani and organising secretary Mantri Srinivasulu are regularly conducting meetings in villages and towns across the state.
“We have set up village-level units in areas such as Sangrur, Mansa, Bathinda and Barnala, with over 10 members per unit. During the SAD-BJP alliance era, we used to have less than half the numbers in these areas, which used to be an Akali domain. Now, people are reaching out to the BJP even from remote villages, and we are telling them about various central government schemes that are not being properly extended to them by the state government (AAP),” said Satwant Singh Punia, a member of the BJP’s National Kisan Morcha who is also a working committee member of the state unit of the party.Advertisement
Asked about the alliance talks, state BJP president Sunil Jakhar on February 8 said, “I am unaware of any development towards an alliance with the Akali Dal. No doubt talks of the NDA reaching out to former allies or vice versa are being heard. The BJP will hold its national council meeting in Delhi from February 16-18. Perhaps during the meeting or afterwards, something more will be heard about new alliances in different parts of the country.”
The Akali Dal is currently conducting its Punjab Bachao Yatra, in which Sukhbir Badal is being projected as its face, with both Sukhbir and his late father Parkash Singh Badal being described as “Vikas Purush”. The Yatra, which started on February 1 from the Attari border in Amritsar, targets the AAP government and aims to cover all Lok Sabha constituencies of Punjab, with Amritsar, Khadoor Sahib, Bathinda, Ferozepur, and Faridkot scheduled for February. “We will cover the rest in March, even if the election code of conduct is implemented by then, as it will then be part of our poll campaign,” senior SAD leader Balwinder Singh Bhunder told The Indian Express.
While many SAD and BJP leaders have made multiple statements hinting that they will fight the polls separately, crucially, neither party has criticised the other in their campaigns. Sukhbir Badal, in the past, has welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s proposal of “one nation one election”, leading to criticism from the AAP.",politics
"In Haryana, key Congress faces missing from LS list; Hooda, Selja leave it to high command","None of the Congress candidates who had contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections for the 10 seats in Haryana figure in the list of 299 applicants who have applied to the party high command to contest the upcoming elections, as the party begins its process of shortlisting candidates.
Among the few prominent faces who have sought party tickets through this process are former Vidhan Sabha Speaker Kuldeep Sharma’s son Chanakya Pandit from Karnal, and retired IPS officer Subhash Yadav from Gurgaon.
Deepak Babaria, AICC in charge of Haryana, told The Indian Express that except a couple of seats, “there is a lot of enthusiasm among party workers and leaders on all other seats”.Advertisement
“There is healthy competition as party workers are staking their claim to contest. The screening committee will meet on February 13, which will send recommendations to the high command. The final meeting is expected to take place in New Delhi on the 15th or 16th of this month, and then the names of the candidates will be announced,” said Babaria.
On senior party leaders missing from the list of those who have applied, Babaria said, “Senior leaders sometimes feel it is the party that should invite them to contest. There is nothing more to it. The party will soon announce its final candidates’ list.”
Talking to The Indian Express, a party veteran said, “The lists compiled by the party include all those who are seeking tickets to contest the Lok Sabha polls. The Congress follows a democratic process. The topmost factor is winnability. Other factors are also kept in mind before declaring candidates. If the high command feels there is some other party worker or leader who needs to be fielded in a particular constituency, it can also be done. Sometimes, big leaders are declared as candidates closer to the polls.”
The list includes a maximum 79 ticket seekers for the Sonipat constituency, and a minimum of three for the Rohtak seat. Interestingly, of the 299 ticket seekers who have submitted their applications till February 7 — the last date for submission — only one had contested in 2019. The exception is former MP Shruti Choudhry, the daughter of senior Congress leader and Tosham MLA Kiran Choudhry. Shruti, who is also one of the four working presidents of the Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee, has applied to contest from the Bhiwani-Mahendragarh Lok Sabha constituency. Four other ticket seekers have also applied for the seat.Advertisement
In 2019, Kumari Selja had contested from Ambala, Nirmal Singh from Kurukshetra, Ashok Tanwar from Sirsa, Bhavya Bishnoi from Hisar, Kuldeep Sharma from Karnal, Bhupinder Singh Hooda from Sonipat, Deepender Singh Hooda from Rohtak, Shruti Choudhary from Bhiwani-Mahendragarh, Ajay Singh Yadav from Gurgaon and Avtar Singh Bhadana from Faridabad. All of them lost to the BJP candidates.
Out of them, Ashok Tanwar and Bhavya Bishnoi are now in the BJP, with Bishnoi representing the BJP from Adampur in the Haryana Vidhan Sabha.
AICC general secretary Kumari Selja, who is the party’s in-charge of Uttarakhand, told The Indian Express, “Even in the past, I had never applied for a ticket. It is for the party high command to decide who will be fielded from where. But frankly, I would want to contest the Vidhan Sabha this time, and had already communicated it to the party.”
Leader of Opposition and former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda told The Indian Express, “I have never applied for a ticket. It is the party that will decide who will contest from where… It is good that party workers are applying to contest. All of them also feel that they are being considered. The high command shall take the final call after screening all applications. As far as I am concerned, I shall go with whatever the party decides.”Advertisement
In 2019, the BJP had got a resounding victory, winning all 10 seats in the state. The highest winning margin was of the BJP’s Sanjay Bhatia, who defeated Kuldeep Sharma by over 6.5 lakh votes, followed by Krishan Pal Gurjar, who trounced Avtar Singh Bhadana by over 6.3 lakh votes.
Bhupinder’s son Deepender Hooda was the only exception, who lost to Arvind Kumar Sharma by a slim margin of around 7,500 votes. Even Bhupinder himself lost to Ramesh Chander Kaushik by over 1.6 lakh votes, while Shruti was defeated by Dharambir by over 4.4 lakh votes.",politics
Decode Politics: Why Sukhbir Badal seeks PM Modi intervention in Shinde govt’s Hazur Sahib Board rejig,"When Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) chief and MP Sukhbir Singh Badal on Friday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking his intervention in the Maharashtra government’s move to reconstitute the Shri Hazur Sahib Gurdwara Management Board, not only was he signalling a thaw in relations between the BJP and the SAD ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, he also put the spotlight back on structural changes in India’s four main gurdwara management institutions and democratic crises in their governing bodies since 2014.
While their alliance talks are reportedly underway, it would not be easy for the SAD to join hands with the BJP again without ensuring reversal of some of the changes made in leading Sikh institutions in the BJP-ruled states.
Badal called the move by the Maharashtra government — in which the BJP is a key part of the ruling coalition led by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde — a “provocative and brazen interference” in the functioning of the board governing the Takht Sachkhand Shri Huzoor Sahib at Nanded, Abchal Nagar Sahib, Maharashtra, through an amendment to the Nanded Sikh Gurdwara Sachkhand Hazur Abchal Nagar Sahib Act, 1956.Advertisement

In his letter to the PM, Badal reminded the Centre that one of the key commitments to Sikhs made by the Government of India after Independence was that it would not interfere in the management of Sikh shrines or other religious affairs without prior approval of a two-thirds majority in the General House of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), which, by virtue of its power in choosing the Akal Takht Jathedar, remains the apex body of Sikhs in India.
This is not the first time that a gurdwara management institution — whether a board as in Nanded, or a committee as in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi — has faced structural changes since 2014. But a lack of elections in these bodies means that they have been facing the charges of non-democratic functioning over the past decade. And the SAD knows it will lose face if it joins the NDA without reversing some of the structural changes in the gurdwara management bodies.

A ‘weakened’ SGPC
Created by the Sikh Gurdwara Act of 1925, the SGPC House needs the involvement of both the Punjab and Central governments in conducting elections for its body. These elections were duly held twice — in 2004 and 2011 — during the 10-year rule of the Congress-led UPA at the Centre. But the BJP-led NDA government that came to power at the Centre in 2014 and of which the SAD was a part till 2020, is yet to facilitate fresh SGPC elections in 10 years.
Meanwhile, around 30 SGPC members out of the 185 who were elected in 2011 — when the last SGPC elections were held — have passed away due to age or health.Advertisement

A 2016 Supreme Court petition allowed the House elected in 2011 with the SAD holding majority to continue working. That tenure too ended in 2021, though the House continues to linger on in the absence of fresh elections.
Although Punjab-based Opposition parties like the SAD (Amritsar) and the United Akali Dal have been periodically demanding elections, the current SGPC leadership has never actively raised the issue with the state or Central governments. The SGPC is the only elected body in which the SAD holds power since it was ousted from power in Punjab in 2017.
In all this, the Punjab government, being led by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) since 2022, threw another challenge to the SGPC in 2023 by introducing an amendment to the Sikh Gurdwara Act without the consent of the SGPC House.

HSGMC: The breakaway body
The Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (HSGMC) was a brainchild of the Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led Congress government in Haryana, which passed a legislation for the formation of a separate managing board for the Sikh gurdwaras in the state in 2014. It however failed to conduct elections to constitute the first ever HSGMC House, before it lost power in 2014.Advertisement

The BJP government that returned to power in Haryana in 2019 under Manohar Lal Khattar, implemented the legislation in 2023 against the wishes of the party’s former alliance partner, the SAD, reducing the size of the nearly 100-year-old SGPC for the first time since Partition.
The first HSGMC elections were scheduled for March 6 this year, but got postponed due to exam season. Meanwhile, Harjinder Singh Dhami, the SGPC president since 2021, alleged that the HSGMC had kept no provision to register political parties and allocate them poll symbols, indicating that this was an attempt to block the SAD from registering for the polls.
In the interim, the HSGMC is being run by an ad-hoc committee beset with infighting, having seen three presidents in one year since it was formed. The SAD alleges that the ad-hoc committee is filled with people who are close to the BJP.
Last year, former Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh had also alleged that under pressure of the BJP-led governments at the Centre and the state, the HSGMC ad-hoc committee had declined to provide langar (free kitchen) to farmers who were protesting across Haryana in 2023, the way the SGPC had provided langar and other services during the over year-long farmers’ protest against the Centre’s now-repealed three farm laws at the Delhi border during 2020-21.Advertisement

That means, the impact of the HSGMC on Sikh affairs will only become apparent after its first House gets elected.
Gurdwara Sachkhand Board, Nanded: Current row
Unlike the parbandhak committees in Punjab, Delhi and now Haryana, the Sachkand gurdwara — which houses the fourth most important Sikh administrative body in India — is a board. That means by statute, 14 of its 17 members are nominated, who would together go on to elect its president.
According to the 1956 Act, the 17-member Takht Hazur Sahib Board comprises of four nominated SGPC members, four members from Sachkhand Hazur Khalsa Diwan, two Sikh MPs, one member of the Chief Khalsa Diwan — a Sikh body older than the SGPC, three members who are elected from the seven districts of Marathwada where most of the Sikhs in Maharashtra live, one member each from Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, and the Nanded collector. Although largely nominated, it represented a diverse Sikh community.
In 2015, the then BJP government in Maharashtra trimmed the powers of the Gurdwara Sachkhand Board by amending Section 11 of the 1956 Act, empowering the state government to nominate 12 board members, leaving three seats to those elected from Marathwada, and two for the SGPC to nominate, while removing the representation from Parliament and other organisations. It also empowered the state government to directly appoint the board’s president. Thereby, the move allows the party in power in Maharashtra to influence the board’s decisions.Advertisement
That same year, BJP MLA Tara Singh became its first president who was a government appointee.
The SGPC had opposed the 2015 amendment, but to no avail. In 2019, the SGPC also blamed the BJP and the RSS for allegedly using the 2015 amendment to indirectly take control of Sikh gurdwaras across the country.
DSGMC factor
The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) House is elected for four years. However, it elects its president after every two years.
Elections for the 51-member DSGMC were last held in August 2021. The SAD secured a majority with 27 seats, though its leader, Manjinder Singh Sirsa, quit as president to join the BJP in December 2021. Election for a new president is due since January 2024, the first time it has been delayed.Advertisement
Meanwhile in January 2022, the rest of the elected members of the SAD turned rebel and formed a new group, which elected Harmeet Singh Kalka as the new president. With the SAD having broken ties with the BJP in 2020, the party alleged that the Kalka group was close to the BJP.
Crises facing SAD
For decades the SAD has faced allegations by Punjab’s Opposition parties of weakening the structure and autonomy of Sikh institutions, including the SGPC, by using its hold over the SGPC for electoral gains in the state.
Ever since the break-up of its alliance with the BJP, the SAD has been making similar allegations against the BJP. Given that the SGPC remains the only elected institution where the SAD holds a majority, the party has been facing the heat. And any future alliance with the BJP would thus not be easy for it, without first extracting concessions that undo at least some of the changes the BJP-led governments has brought in the Sikh institutions.",politics
"Poised to tie up with RLD, BJP eyes Jat base consolidation, West UP booster in LS polls","The alliance with the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) is “almost final”, sources in the BJP said, with the Jayant Chaudhary-led party agreeing on two Lok Sabha constituencies and a Rajya Sabha seat as part of the arrangement with the NDA.
This partnership will help the BJP consolidate its base among the Jats, which are the RLD’s core base, and place it ahead in at least seven seats in West UP, where its prospects were considered grim as per ground surveys done by the party ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.
BJP sources said that either Chaudhary — who is a Rajya Sabha MP and the grandson of former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh — or his wife Charu Singh is likely to contest from Baghpat. The seat was once considered a Chaudhary family bastion, but the BJP has been winning it since 2014. It is currently represented by the BJP’s Satya Pal Singh. Sources also indicated that the RLD might also be fielding a candidate from Bijnor.Advertisement
Alongside these seats as part of the alliance pact with the BJP,
The RLD could also get one Rajya Sabha seat, sources said, adding that former Union agriculture minister Sompal Shastri is likely to be considered for it. The BJP is also looking to support the RLD with an MLC seat in the UP Assembly, sources said.
A senior BJP leader said the alliance would be announced soon.
“With Prime Minister Narendra Modi setting the target at 400 plus for the NDA, we will join hands with smaller parties in the different parts of the country,” said a senior party leader.Advertisement
“The doors of the BJP are open for all its former partners,” said the leader.
As per BJP leaders, an alliance with the RLD could brighten its chances in West UP. Despite the boost the party got in the wake of the consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, the ground survey conducted by the party placed it behind in seats like Bijnor, Amroha, Kairana, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Fatehpur Sikri and Hathras.
“There were indications that the party would face a tough battle in these constituencies. The Jat leaders in the BJP organisation and government who were expected to win over the community appeared to have failed or have not succeeded to ensure the seats for the party,” said a BJP leader from UP.
The Jat community has significant influence in a dozen Lok Sabha and around 40 Assembly seats in West UP. They are estimated to make up between 10 and 15 per cent of the population in some 15 districts, but are socially dominant, vocal, and have the capacity to build a political atmosphere.Advertisement
The BJP had earlier rewarded prominent Jat leaders from the region to consolidate the community’s votes. While Sanjeev Balyan was made a minister of state, Bhupendra Chaudhary was made the UP BJP state president.
The BJP’s move on Friday to announce the prestigious Bharat Ratna for late Charan Singh indicated the symbolic value attached to it. Reacting to this announcement, Jayant gave enough hints of the impending alliance with the BJP. “Dil jeet liya (you have won my heart)”, he posted on X.
In Parliament on Saturday, Jayant praised the Modi government for conferring the Bharat Ratna on Charan Singh. The Opposition members raised objections, asking under which rule he had been allowed to speak on the issue.
Reacting to the Opposition’s stance on the floor of the Upper House, Jayant said: “It was strange that they objected to me placing the emotions of the millions of farmers in this country. It seems they were not able to digest it. Why are they questioning the timing? Does it mean that no one should be conferred with Bharat Ratna in election year?”Advertisement
He added: “How does the political party in power pick people to be honoured? They will look for political gains and see issues that are linked to people’s sentiments. If a government has sensed the sentiments of the people and honoured a leader, what’s wrong in it?”
Asked about the “deal” with the BJP, Jayant said: “It is not a deal, it is about trust.”
During the campaigning of the 2022 UP polls, when the RLD was the SP, Jayant was asked about shifting alliances. He replied: “Mein koi chavanni nahi palatne keliye ( I am not a coin that would flip)”.
Asked about this statement on Saturday, he said: “In the heat of elections, you make several statements… They (opposition leaders) also should recollect what all statements they had made during the campaign.”",politics
Today in Politics: Will BJP join hands with OPS? Nadda visit to Tamil Nadu fuels alliance buzz,"While the Opposition INDIA bloc lurches from crisis to crisis, the ruling BJP seems to be finalising talks with its alliance partners.
The BJP’s deal with the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), which has an influence among Jats in western UP, is said to be “almost final”, with an announcement expected any day now. A political arrangement in Tamil Nadu seems to be next on the party’s agenda.
On Sunday, BJP national president J P Nadda will head to Tamil Nadu to address a public meeting at Mint Street, Harbour, in central Chennai. He will also meet former chief minister O Panneerselvam or OPS – who has been expelled from the AIADMK – as part of this visit.Advertisement
Tamil Nadu BJP president K Annamalai’s “En Mann, En Makkal” (my land, my people) padayatra, which has been criss-crossing the state for the last six months, was initially supposed to be in Chennai Sunday, coinciding with Nadda’s visit. Annamalai was looking to hold a road show. The BJP has claimed that the DMK government has refused permission for the event.
There is buzz on the alliance front in Tamil Nadu too. Speaking to the media on Friday, OPS said: “Alliance talks are finalised. Talks are going on with the BJP. A mega alliance will be formed in Tamil Nadu to choose Narendra Modi as PM again.”
Nadda’s trip to Chennai will be under the spotlight to see the progress of this alliance move.
In the 2019 elections, the DMK-led coalition, of which the Congress is also a part, had won 38 of the 39 seats in the state. The Congress and the DMK have also recently reaffirmed their partnership and are holding seat-sharing talks.Advertisement
In context: After a power tussle over the control of the AIADMK with party general secretary and ex-CM E Palaniswami or EPS, OPS was expelled from the party in July 2022. In May 2023, the Madras High Court dismissed his appeal over the use of the AIADMK’s flag, election symbol and letterhead.
In September 2023, the AIADMK said it was breaking “all ties with the BJP-led NDA alliance” and cited the BJP’s attacks, particularly by Annamalai, on the party as the reason. The BJP and the AIADMK also held talks to resolve issues, but senior BJP leaders were said to have not shown an inclination to “rein in” Annamalai as demanded by the AIADMK.
Subsequently, in January, indicating that a new political shift was underway in the state, T T V Dhinakaran, who heads the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK), a breakaway faction of the AIADMK, hinted at a possible alliance with the BJP-led NDA as well as OPS.
Dhinakaran had said there was nothing wrong in joining hands with the BJP, though a decision had not been taken. He said that while he had criticised the Modi government earlier, it was because of its schemes affecting farmers and people of Tamil Nadu, and that the BJP had “altered its stand”.Advertisement
UP legislators to visit Ram Temple

During a discussion on the Budget in the House on Saturday, the Speaker said to Akhilesh, “You come with us to Ayodhya tomorrow.”
Responding to this, Akhilesh, who is the Leader of the Opposition, said: “We will go only when Lord Shri Ram calls us.”Advertisement

Modi played unparalleled role in uniting nation: House Chairs,"The Chairs of both Houses of Parliament Saturday praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for playing an “unparalleled role” in uniting the entire nation on the “auspicious occasion” of the consecration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya.
Addressing the Lok Sabha after a discussion on Ram temple in which 26 members including Union Home Minister Amit Shah participated, Speaker Om Birla said, “January 22, 2024, has filled every corner of the country with amazing joy and enthusiasm… It has become a national festival, about which our generations will continue to be enthralled for ages… Our Honourable Prime Minister has played an unparalleled role in uniting the entire nation on this auspicious occasion associated with Lord Ram… We all are very proud to pass this resolution related to the grand temple of Lord Shri Ram, which has become a symbol of the sentiment of the people in Ayodhya.”
The same address was read out in Rajya Sabha by its ex-officio Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar in the presence of Prime Minister Modi.Advertisement
Delivering the valedictory address in the last sitting of the 17th Lok Sabha and referring to the “resolution on Ram temple that this House has passed”, Prime Minister Modi said, “It will give constitutional powers to the future generations of the country to take pride in its heritage.” He said the resolution comprises samvedna (sensitivity), sankalp (resolve) and sahanubhuti (sympathy) along with the mantra of ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’.
On the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, the Prime Minister said, “Chunav bahut door nahin hain. Kuchh logon ko ghabrahat hoti hogi. (Elections are not far away. Some people might be nervous).” He said elections are a natural and essential dimension of democracy. “I am confident that the elections will be in accordance with the glory of our democracy,” he said.
Modi said the next 25 years are very important for our country. “Political activities have their place but the aspirations, expectations, dreams and resolve of the country is that these 25 years are something in which the country will achieve the desired results,” he said.
Noting that the 17th Lok Sabha recorded a productivity of 97 per cent, Modi said, “I am confident that as we conclude the 17th Lok Sabha, we will transition into the 18th Lok Sabha with a resolution to achieve more than 100 per cent productivity.”Advertisement
Elaborating on the key business agenda transacted by the current Lok Sabha, the Prime Minister mentioned abrogation of Article 370 and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. “This same House removed Article 370… For 75 years after independence, our justice system was dictated by the rules made by the Britishers. But now, our future generations will proudly say that they live in a society that follows Nyaya Sanhita and not ‘Dand Sanhita’… We can say with satisfaction that many things for which many generations waited were completed through this 17th Lok Sabha. The wait of the generations is over,” he said.
Referring to the Covid-19 period, Modi said that in these five years, mankind faced the biggest crisis of this century. “Remembering the challenging times of Covid, I want to express my gratitude to the members of Parliament who decided to relinquish their privileges in times of need without a second thought,” Modi said.
Discussing the construction of the New Parliament building, Modi said, “Everyone used to discuss that there should be a new building of the Parliament. But no decision used to be taken. It was your (Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla) leadership that decided this, held meetings with the government and as a result, the country received this new Parliament building.”
The Parliament will continue to inspire its members to leave behind a legacy and work to fulfil the dreams and aspirations of future generations with the collective effort of all its members. Modi said the last five years in the country have been of “reform, perform and transform”.Advertisement
Earlier in the day, during the discussion on Ram temple, Home Minister Amit Shah said January 22 marked the “end of a struggle and a movement that began in 1528” and that it would remain a historic day for ten thousand years. “Ram temple is a victory of vikas (development) over vidhwansh (destruction). It is a day of hope, aspiration and accomplishment of crores of devotees…It is the beginning of India’s glorious era…,” he said.
Soon after the discussion, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla addressed the House under Rule 360, and said, “The construction of a grand and divine temple of Lord Shri Ram at his birthplace in the ancient holy city of Ayodhya is a historic and glorious achievement for the country. All of us MPs, with full unity, obeisance and devotion, join the joy and enthusiasm of the countrymen on this occasion and also appreciate it through this resolution. This is an unforgettable moment in the country’s development journey, which is extremely important for India socially, culturally and historically).”
“January 22, 2024 has filled every corner of the country with amazing joy and enthusiasm. There was a lot of discussion about Ram temple in different cultures around the world. A sea of faith was seen rising everywhere. It has become a national festival, about which our generations will continue to be enthralled for ages,” he said.
“Our Honourable Prime Minister has played an unparalleled role in uniting the entire nation on this auspicious occasion associated with Lord Ram. He followed the difficult Yama-Niyamas with complete dedication for the ritual of consecration of the idol of Shri Ramlalla. During this, he also visited important pilgrimage places associated with Lord Shri Ram from Nashik to Lepakshi and Triprayar to Rameshwaram and gave the message of national unity. This journey has once again made the countrymen experience the power of unity in diversity, and has awakened a wonderful, spiritual consciousness in the entire public,” Birla said.Advertisement
“After centuries of tapasya (penance), the temple of Lord Shri Ram being built in Ayodhya has started a new era of good governance and public welfare in the country. We all are very proud to pass this resolution related to the grand temple of Lord Shri Ram, which has become a symbol of the sentiments of the people in Ayodhya. We are confident that this historic achievement will convey the values of hope, unity and collectivism to the coming generations. Along with this, it will also deepen the feeling of unity in diversity of our country,” he said.",politics

The RJD called a meeting of its 79 MLAs in Patna Saturday, even as JD(U) minister Shravan Kumar hosted a lunch for his party’s 45 MLAs in Patna.

Saturday also saw both CPI(ML-Liberation) MLAs — Mehboob Alam and Satydeo Ram — meeting Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) patron Jitan Ram Manjhi, in what was described as a courtesy call. Former CM Manjhi later reiterated his party’s position, which he had already clarified on Friday in a post on X that “Mai garib hoon lekin dhokebaz nahi. PM Modi ke saath hi rahenge (I’m poor, but not a betrayer. I’ll continue to be with PM Modi)”.
With the support of four HAM(S) MLAs and an Independent legislator, the NDA has 128 MLAs in the 243-member House.
Manjhi’s statement holds political significance as the numbers in the Bihar House are currently stacked in a fine balance in favour of the NDA, and can only get disturbed if the HAM(S) MLAs cross over to the grand alliance. Even without the HAM(S) support, the NDA would have a simple majority of 124 MLAs (BJP 78, JD(U) 45 and Independent 1), but it would be wafer thin, as the grand alliance has 114 MLAs (RJD 79, Congress 19, CPI (ML-Liberation) 12, CPI 1 and CPM 2). The AIMIM with one MLA is not supporting any coalition.Advertisement

Asked if the BJP is wary of cross-voting by its MLAs, its spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said: “If this is what is being made out from our two-day Gaya training camp, let me clarify that it was a pre-scheduled event. We are fully confident of winning the trust vote.”
On the alleged attempts at getting the RJD MLAs to defect, Rajya Sabha MP and RJD national spokesperson Manoj Kumar Jha said: “Even when the party had touched its ebb (after 2010 Assembly polls), such attempts did not succeed. Now that we are the single largest party in the state since the 2020 polls, we are even more confident of holding on to our numbers. We’ll follow due legislative procedures during the trust vote.”
JD(U) national spokesperson Rajib Ranjan said: “People are reading too much into the political events ahead of the trust vote. There is no question of herding our MLAs. We will win the trust vote as a matter of routine procedure.”
Referring to the Congress herding its MLAs in Hyderabad, he added, “Those who are panicking are worried, not us.”Advertisement

"Congress plays safe, extols Lord Ram’s values to slam govt","Forced to join a debate in Parliament on the opening of the Ram Temple, the Congress and a handful of other opposition parties – many from the INDIA bloc did not participate in the discussions in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha – accused the BJP of spreading hatred and animosity in the name of Ram and using religion to secure power but skirted the issue of thinning of the line that demarcates religion and state.
Congress leaders repeatedly said in both Houses that the path for construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya was opened by the Supreme Court verdict and they respect the decision. In sharp contrast, AIMIM member Asaduddin Owaisi asked in Lok Sabha whether the government has any religion and whether the Narendra Modi government stands for only religion and one shade of Hindutva.
Owaisi said the light of Indian democracy is at its “dimmest” today. “I want to ask when the government replies to this debate will it focus on 140 crore Indians or only the Hindutva population?”Advertisement

The Congress danced around the issue.
In Rajya Sabha, Congress MPs Pramod Tiwari and Randeep Surjewala said it was the Supreme Court that cleared the way for construction of the Ram Temple.
“We respect that. But mind you… Ram is love, justice, tolerance, virtue and ideal… If he is all this… then the name of Ram and Ram cannot be an issue for partisan politics. It is a sin to use the name of Ram for politics and votes… To spread hatred in the name of Ram is a bigger sin and violence in the name of Ram is the path to hell. If you still don’t change… then Ram will never forgive you. Jai Siya Ram,” Surjewala said.
Tiwari added: “Many people wanted the issue to remain alive. That the bloodshed should continue so that they can continue to do their politics and secure power.”Advertisement
“I had asked Kalyan Singh once as to when the temple would be built and he said when we have a government at the Centre. When that happened I asked him again and he said I will tell you later. I say this with confidence that this temple has been built because of court orders,” Tiwari said.
The Congress MPs extolled the virtues and ideals of Ram and his ideals and quoted Ramcharitmanas to slam the BJP and its government. They also argued that the consecration was done in an “incomplete temple”, a point the party had made while declining the invite extended to its leaders Sonia Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury for attending the temple opening.

“I am a proud Hindu, Sanatani and a Brahmin. But I am one who has faith in Ram, who worships him, who tries to walk on his principles. I am not a trader engaged in trading Ram. My only peeve at the consecration is that it was done in an incomplete temple. What was the hurry? The entire society has been put in danger. It is said that if an incomplete temple is consecrated it is ominous for society,” Tiwari said.
“If the temple had to be consecrated, it should have been done by priests. Why were those people there who had no association with it?”Advertisement
“Both your policy and your intentions are bad. You have Lord Ram on the ballot box, I condemn you. Idhar jo baithe hain wo Bhagwan Ram ke pujari hain, aur udhar jo baithe hain wo Bhagwan Ram ke vyapari hain,” Tiwari said.
He also claimed that the temple has been constructed hundreds of metres away from the actual birthplace of Lord Ram and demanded that an all-party team of parliamentarians be formed to inspect the site.
Surjewala was scathing. Quoting Mahatma Gandhi’s 1929 article in Young Indian magazine, which said the ancient ideal of Ram Rajya is undoubtedly one of true democracy in which there is justice for all, he said: “Does today’s government live up to Gandhi’s ideal of Ram Rajya? I leave it to their wisdom.”
“When Ram is the epitome of justice, patience, compassion, tolerance, virtue and duty, then hatred, negativity, despair, animosity, dispute, hostility and violence cannot be spread in his name…,” he said.Advertisement
Quoting a verse from Tulsi Das’s Ramcharitmanas in which he said Ram as a king himself had asked his subjects to stop him if he did injustice to them, Surjewala said, “Do the rulers of today live up to those high ideals… is it not that the voice is throttled when questions are asked, is it not that those who are asking questions to government could land in jail… Is it not that asking questions about the policies and conduct of the government could earn the wrath of ED, CBI and Income Tax.”
“When Ram is the symbol of patience and tolerance, then how the ruling forces are taking the path of division and violence… When Ram is the symbol of ethical policies and ideals… then policies of governance are sitting in the lap of some capitalists sacrificing the people’s mandate…,” he said.
In Lok Sabha, Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi too argued Mahatma Gandhi’s Ram Rajya was one where none, including minorities, was discriminated against, and sought to know why BJP leaders’ “Jai Shri Ram” slogan was made not in a tone of compassion but in a tone of “bitterness and violence”.
“Why is there such bitterness, violence and hatred when they say Jai Shri Ram? If you hate people and spread hatred, and disturb others’ religious practices, you cannot be a Ram Bhakt. It seems you have forgotten the core instructions of Dr Ambedkar in the Constitution,” Gogoi said. “Our commitment is to the Constitution. Jai Hind, Jai Samvidhan…”Advertisement
“Truth, service, justice and compassion have also been included in our Constitution as core ideas. Mahatma Gandhi talked about Ram Rajya. He defined it as a reign where all are happy and none is sad. So, we should think whether all the backward, oppressed and minorities are happy – this was the core of Ram Rajya,” he said. “But atrocities on SCs and STs are increasing. Is this Ram Rajya? The backward are demanding caste census, as they feel they are being discriminated against. They are being deprived of proper representation in universities and in the central government. What about that Dalit girl of Unnao (referring to the rape case where a BJP leader was the accused) or the protesting female wrestlers?”

"Kejriwal pulls curtains on INDIA in Punjab, Chandigarh; says AAP will contest all 14 seats","Dealing a blow to the Opposition INDIA alliance, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Saturday that his party will contest all 13 parliamentary constituencies in Punjab as well as the Chandigarh seat in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls on its own steam.
Kejriwal’s assertion closed the door for any further seat-sharing negotiations between the AAP and the Congress in Punjab. Both parties are key constituents of the INDIA bloc.
Kejriwal made the announcement while addressing an event at Khanna in Punjab, where he inaugurated the Bhagwant Mann-led AAP government’s “Ghar Ghar (home-delivery) ration scheme” to provide wheat or flour at the doorstep of the beneficiaries.Advertisement
“Two years ago, you gave us (AAP) a huge blessing of 92 seats out of 117 (in the Punjab Assembly polls). You created history,” Kejriwal said. “I have come to you with folded hands today to seek another blessing. In two months, there will be Lok Sabha elections. In these elections, there are 13 seats. There is another seat in Chandigarh. In the coming 10-15 days, AAP will announce its candidates. Now, I request you all to bless AAP the same way to win 14 seats.”

The seat-sharing troubles between the Congress and the AAP for the Punjab seats have been persistent, with senior leaders from both parties openly making statements against the tie-up. However, their coming together for the recent Chandigarh mayoral polls had signalled that the differences were being resolved.
On January 24, CM Mann had said the AAP would not ally with the Congress in Punjab. However, even after the CM’s announcement, the AAP’s general secretary (organisation) Sandeep Pathak had said the final call would be taken by the party leadership.
A few weeks earlier, Mann had sought to nuance his hardline position over the possibility of the AAP’s tie-up with the Congress, saying the INDIA bloc’s main aim was to defeat the BJP and “save the country”.Advertisement
However, with Kejriwal’s announcement now, the INDIA alliance seems to have unravelled in Punjab.
The development is a major setback for the alliance which has already been reeling from the exit of the Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) in Bihar and is now staring at likely switch of the Jayant Chaudhary-led RLD to the NDA in Uttar Pradesh. It also comes amid reports that the estranged NDA allies BJP and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) have started talks to explore the possibility of restoration of their alliance.
Senior Punjab Congress leaders have opposed the party’s alliance with the AAP right from the beginning, alleging that the Mann government was “weaponising” the Vigilance Bureau to book their party leaders in corruption cases.
After the arrest of Congress MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira in January, Leader of the Opposition Partap Singh Bajwa charged that his arrest was an example of “vendetta politics”.Advertisement
The Congress is the principal Opposition in Punjab. A senior state Congress functionary had told The Indian Express earlier that leaders across the party ranks, including former ministers, had been voicing their “issues” with a pre-poll partnership with the AAP.

On January 16, the two parties however announced an alliance for the January 30 Chandigarh mayoral elections, a move that was looked at as the INDIA bloc’s first electoral test before the Lok Sabha polls.
At the time, AAP MP Raghav Chadha hailed the alliance and said: “This will be an election where for the first time it will be INDIA vs BJP… After this election, the scorecard will be INDIA 1, BJP 0.” Senior Congress leader Pawan Kumar Bansal had also echoed similar views.
The mayoral polls had however descended into chaos with the AAP-Congress combine questioning the manner in which eight of its votes were declared invalid by the presiding officer, tipping the scales in favour of BJP candidate Manoj Sonkar who was declared the winner. The matter is now pending before the Supreme Court.Advertisement
In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in Punjab, the Congress had won eight seats as against the SAD’s two seats and the BJP’s two. The AAP had then won just one seat. The Chandigarh seat was won by the BJP’s Kirron Kher.",politics
"In Kerala, Congress puts up united face as Sudhakaran, Satheesan set off on yatra to take on CPM, BJP","The Congress party’s protest yatra in Kerala ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, which was launched Friday, is being led by state Congress president K Sudhakaran as well as the senior party leader and Leader of Opposition in the Assembly, V D Satheesan.
Their joint efforts for the yatra across Kerala has surprised many, as the differences in the state Congress have come to the fore repeatedly over the past several months.
At a press conference held after the Congress won a bypoll in Puthuppally in September last year – necessitated after the death of former CM Oommen Chandy – Sudhakaran and Satheesan had bickered openly.Advertisement
They argued over who would kick off the press conference, with Sudhakaran saying: “I am the KPCC president. I will start the press conference. You can speak later.”.

Satheesan later refused a shawl offered by a party worker and directed questions from journalists to Sudhakaran. “The president has said everything,” Satheesan had said.
Sudhakaran has landed in several controversies over his alleged “pro-RSS statements”, which he was forced to brush aside after facing backlash from his party and the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), the party’s ally in the state.
In December last year, Sudhakarn came under fire for backing Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan’s decision to nominate RSS/ABVP- affiliated members to the senates of two universities. A year prior to this row, he had ruffled feathers when he claimed to have offered protection to the RSS shakhas in his home district of Kannur as they allegedly faced threats from the communists. He even said that India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was “magnanimous” enough to induct RSS leader Syama Prasad Mookerjee into his Cabinet, lauding Nehru’s “large-heartedness”.Advertisement
Now, with the duo together traversing 20 Lok Sabha seats, the Congress hopes to showcase a united image ahead of the polls, party leaders said.

On the yatra being led by two leaders, Satheesan said: “It is the party’s decision that we should lead this agitation together. Recently, the party had conventions in all 14 districts, in which both leaders took part. That had created unity and enthusiasm among the party workers. To retain that tempo, the party decided that this journey should also be led by us,’’ he said. Satheesan said the yatra, titled samaragni (flame of protest), is against the BJP-led Centre and the LDF-led state government.
“We are going to meet ordinary people who are affected by the wrong policies of both governments. The state’s social welfare sector is shattered. We would meet people who are victims of the collapsed welfare machinery. Also, there would be a campaign against the BJP bid to polarise people on lines of religion. This yatra would reflect Congress’ sharp campaign against fascism and communalism,’’ he said.
After the Congress-led UDF lost in the 2021 Assembly polls to enable the CPM-led LDF to score second successive win — the first time in four decades that a party in Kerala achieved this – the Congress won bypolls in Thrikkakara (June 2022) and Puthupally (September 2023).Advertisement

The Congress hopes to make the most in the coming Lok Sabha polls as it faces a formidable challenge from the CPM, which is also its ally in the INDIA bloc at the national level. With the BJP going all out in a bid to open its account in Kerala – the party has never won a parliamentary seat in the state – the Congress is also launching a spirited attack on it. The BJP is already taking out its own statewide yatra under its state unit chief K Surendran.
The CPM has already set the tone for the coming polls. The party has been calling Governor Khan, with whom it has been engaged in a protracted standoff, an alleged “agent of the RSS”.
The LDF has also launched a campaign against the fiscal policies of the Central government in relation to devolution of funds to the state, taking the fight to New Delhi on Thursday. This protest, coming a day after a similar demonstration held by Karnataka’s Congress government, was framed as a “fight to protect federal principles’’. By raising the issue, the LDF has already pitched itself as the principal opponent of the Narendra Modi dispensation in Kerala.
Meanwhile, none of the Congress leaders in Kerala, which would not want to side with the CPM, has spoken on the protest even as their Karnataka party colleagues have been protesting over the same issue.Advertisement

"Bruised by poll loss, Congress on the ropes in Madhya Pradesh, BJP looks to go in for the kill","Angry Congress workers held up placards with photographs of Jabalpur Mayor Jagat Bahadur Singh “Annu”, with the words “vinamra shraddhanjali (humble tribute)” written on them, even as others took a dip in the Narmada and performed “death rites” on its banks.
“Gaddaro ko pehchan ke, joota maaro taan ke (Identify the traitors, hit them with shoes)”, the Congress workers shouted as they demonstrated on Thursday against Annu’s departure to the BJP. The Congress’s first mayor in Jabapur in 18 years, Annu’s decision to defect took party leaders by surprise at a time when they are still recovering from the Assembly elections in which the BJP won a massive 163 of the 230 Assembly seats.
Not just Annu. With just a few months to go before the Lok Sabha elections, a string of leaders have begun deserting the party. Annu was a confidant of senior MP Vivek Tankha who belongs to former Chief Minister Kamal Nath’s camp. He quit the party on February 7 with more than 50 party leaders from the Mahakaushal region. There, the Congress party has a considerable presence compared to the other regions of the state, where the BJP has set up formidable strongholds. On February 8, former state advocate general Shashank Shekhar joined the BJP. He is also considered close to Tankha and is from Mahakaushal.Advertisement
They are not alone. Guna leader Sumer Singh, a loyalist of former CM Digvijaya Singh, left the party to join the BJP on February 7. Both Singh and Annu said the senior leadership’s decision to skip the Ram Mandir consecration ceremony was a reason for their departure. A few days ago, Congress leader Ekta Thakur, who was its candidate from Mahakaushal’s Sihora seat, joined the BJP, while last month former Morena MLA and Jyotiraditya Scindia loyalist Rakesh Mavai switched to the BJP.

This exodus of leaders underscores the extent of the challenge before the new state Congress president Jitu Patwari. While he grapples with disgruntled senior leaders who fear being replaced by the next generation and youth leaders who seek greener pastures in the BJP, the party faces an uphill battle of stopping the BJP from sweeping all 29 Lok Sabha seats in the state. The ruling party has placed special emphasis on Mahakaushal, where former CM Kamal Nath’s family bastion Chhindwara is located. It was the only parliamentary seat the Congress holds at present.
The departures have dented the morale in the Congress, especially that of youth leaders and grassroots workers and beneath the surface there is still simmering anger against the state leadership over ticket distribution that many believe cost the party the elections. A sense of despondence has seeped in among youth leaders who believe it will be difficult to counter “Modi guarantees” and the party’s Ram Mandir narrative.
“We have already been damaged and our organisation cannot be broken down any more. I think for the smaller parties it will be a battle of existence. We will still exist even with 50,000 members across the country,” said a Congress youth leader in the state.
The BJP playAdvertisement
BJP insiders told The Indian Express that the party had been trying to break away many senior leaders from the Congress, especially in regions where it believes it does not have the strength to destroy the Opposition party’s confidence. The ruling party has opened its back channels and is in touch with several Congress leaders lobbying to find respectable positions in the state BJP if they leave the Congress.
State BJP secretary Rajneesh Aggarwal told The Indian Express, “If the Congress leaders want to walk on our ideology and follow PM Modi’s leadership then what is the problem? We will not compromise on our ideology. They are free to join us.”
With the BJP moving ahead with its strategy of tying the Ram Mandir issue to the election, Congress leaders say the central leadership miscalculated. “In the Assembly elections, the BJP kept taunting Rahul that they had announced the date. They kept saying we won’t go. Now, what they said turned out to be true. Our leaders refused to go and this was a major miscalculation. Look at the atmosphere now. People celebrated the event like Diwali. We cannot defend not going to the event. This will damage us,” said a Congress leader.
State Congress vice president J P Dhanopia told The Indian Express, “We never said no to the Ram Mandir event. The BJP-RSS captured the entire event and dominated it. We said no to that. The leaders who have left were greedy and expected action to be taken against them. But the BJP will be filled to the brim with these turncoat leaders and they won’t have respectable positions. What will they do there? We are trying our best to stop the leaders. But if they want to leave, let them leave.”Advertisement
Also read in Political Pulse | Today in Politics: With Parliament set to discuss Ram Temple, how will Opposition respond?
About the defections, a senior Youth Congress leader said, “Most of the leaders who left quit for other reasons other than Ram Mandir. Annu left because the Jabalpur Corporation’s finances are very shaky. He can be removed anytime. He joined the BJP to ensure he stays relevant. The BJP is targeting our leadership in areas they consider themselves weak, where they expect the victory margin may be less than one lakh. They are trying to destroy the youth leadership’s confidence. They have damaged us. But we have begun damage control operations.”
BJP’s Rajneesh Aggarwal said Ram Mandir was not the only issue on which the Congress miscalculated. “From Rahul Gandhi to Jitu Patwari, they are all disconnected from real issues and people. There is no ideology, work ethic or vision. Once their leaders realise that the public is not with them, they will leave the party,” he said.",politics
"Abhishek Singhvi interview: ‘Uttarakhand UCC’s live-in provision is surveillance by registration…directly violative of many SC judgments on privacy, autonomy & Art 21’Premium Story","The Congress Working Committee (CWC)’s member and the party’s national spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi is a three-time Rajya Sabha MP and an eminent lawyer. He is currently also the chairman of Parliamentary Standing Committees on Home Affairs, Law, and Commerce. In an interview with The Indian Express, Singhvi speaks on various burning issues, ranging from the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) to the Gyanvapi and Mathura disputes. Excerpts:
Q) Uttarakhand ruled by the BJP has just become the first state to pass a UCC Bill. How do you view it as a veteran Congress leader and as a senior lawyer from legal and political points of view?
It is clearly a political and symbolic gesture, unleashed just before (Lok Sabha) elections, with the usual great event management and fanfare for which the BJP is famous. If the UCC is to have any meaning, it has to be the product of all-India consensus in a single national law. The BJP is far away from that, so it has gone ahead and done this usual tokenism, very similar to the Women’s Reservation Bill we saw a short while ago.Advertisement
Q) Are there any objectionable provisions in this UCC legislation?
The most objectionable part of the UCC is this huge moral policing and intrusion regarding live-in relationships. It is astonishing that a civil code has at all brought in this topic because it does not belong to the core issues of the UCC. I call it surveillance by registration. It is directly violative of innumerable Supreme Court judgments adumbrating the rights to privacy, autonomy and Article 21 generally.The harassment arising will be unending and serious. You are allowing even third parties to complain and parental, governmental and third party intrusion and harassment is inevitable. The reason given for it is laughable. Crimes against women are not prevented by registration.
Also Read | Inheritance in Uttarakhand UCC: What do Hindus, Muslims, and Christians gain or lose?
Secondly, this UCC is actually over 80 per cent imposition from the Hindu laws of divorce, succession and guardianship. This is largely a unilateral imposition of the rules governing the majority community with minimal effort at consensus and being done at a time when India has the most divisive ambiance in living memory. The constitutional reference to UCC was put in Article 44 as the approximation of an ideal like abolition of liquor in Article 47 and provision of adequate means of livelihood in Article 39 (a) — not as a sudden, piecemeal, state imposition before elections.
Thirdly, is it not anomalous and strange that the government’s own Law Commission barely a couple of years ago says UCC is “neither necessary nor desirable” and merely by changing its members, the government gets a new report. That itself reduces its credibility.Advertisement
Also Read | Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code: Registration of live-ins, jail term raise questions of privacy & liberty
Q) It is said that many of the BJP governments will enact a similar Uniform Code?
This is a contradiction in terms, a delicious paradox. You will supposedly have a series of differing state enactments which will be identified by the oxymoron “uniform”. How can multiple family law regimes of differing diversity in different states be called a Uniform Code. It is linked to what I call limping family laws. The Uttarakhand UCC applies to any resident of Uttarakhand even though he may be working elsewhere or travelling elsewhere. It applies even if one partner is resident in Uttarakhand. So we will now have artificial changes of residence by persons who will want to escape the rigours of the draconian registration requirements. Will we have people creating domiciles and residences in other parts of India to evade this law?
Linked to this is the fact that there are several Central laws already in existence – be it for Hindus or Parsis or Christians or Muslims. Clearly, under the Seventh Schedule of our Constitution, the Uttarakhand UCC cannot be operative unless and until it obtains Presidential assent because the inevitable conflict between it and the Central laws will render it void. I do understand, of course, that Presidential assent will be given for the asking.
Also Read | From the Urdu Press: ‘Gyanvapi row: but Muslims should keep seeking justice’, ‘Kharge needs to rise to stem INDIA rot’
The clear violation of all norms of privacy and liberty and the draconian policing of relationships which are not marriage but in the nature of marriage will clearly violate so many judgments of the Supreme Court – from Khusbhoo to Navtej Johar to the more recent same-sex marriage case Supriyo— apart from being completely inconsistent with Article 21. Good or bad I don’t know, but HUF and coparcenary rights, especially qua succession, seem to have also been abolished after the Uttarakhand UCC because no provision preserves them. I don’t know the reaction of the Hindu community to this.Advertisement
Q) Are there any positive aspects in the UCC passed by the Uttarakhand Assembly?
Absolutely. For example, all children, whether the product of live-in relationships or marriage, are treated as legitimate and, more importantly, are given all other rights which are available to legitimate children. I also have no problem with the 18 and 21 years of uniform ages for females and males to marry. Some other anachronisms have been ironed out: for example, class one heirs earlier did not include the father of the deceased, which has now been added.
Also Read | What is the dispute around the Gyanvapi mosque-Kashi Vishwanath temple complex in Varanasi?
In the end I would say that unity is far more important than uniformity and the Constitution’s commitment is no less to cultural accommodation while talking of the UCC in the Directive Principles. The UCC’s reference in the Constitution cannot be used to put the state inside the home and the private lives of people nor is it supposed to be a battering ram for India’s mosaic of multiculturalism.

Q) The courts are entertaining petitions on Gyanvapi and Mathura disputes despite the Places of Worship Act, 1991.Advertisement
The core question which is being ducked by everyone, by all stakeholders, is not whether there was a temple below the mosque or not. The core question is whether the Places of Worship Act allows the removal of any place of worship on the assumed or proved ground of a prior structure existing underneath. That question had not been answered by any court and, unfortunately, that is the logically prior and threshold question.
Q) Do you apprehend that the BJP government will amend or repeal the Places of Worship Act?
Firstly, I can’t answer that question. You need to ask the government. Secondly, no one should shake the confidence of diverse stakeholders of the nation on the basis of some knee-jerk or short-term reactions.",politics
Decode Politics: Why Kerala finds itself in court over caste census,"AMID THE growing demand for a caste census in Kerala, particularly in the wake of Bihar’s caste survey, the CPI(M)-led LDF state government has told the Assembly that it would take a call on the same only after arriving at a consensus among various communities, and when the Supreme Court takes a final decision on contempt of court petitions pending before it.
Kerala Minister for Welfare of SC, ST, Backward Classes K Radhakrishnan put forward the government stand while replying to a calling attention motion moved by IUML MLA Dr M K Muneer on the need to conduct a caste census in the state.
Urging a consensus, Radhakrishnan said: “The government does not want to abolish or usurp the rights of any segment.”Advertisement

* What are the cases pending before the Supreme Court?
The Kerala government is facing two contempt of court petitions for its failure to comply with a High Court verdict of 2020, which had asked the state to conduct a survey to identify socially and economically backward classes.
While disposing of petitions moved by two organisations – Manavaikyavedi and a Minority Indians Planning and Vigilance Committee – the High Court had directed the Centre and Kerala to take steps to finalise a study for identification of such groups in the state, and submit a report to the state commission for backward classes. The commission and Centre were further directed to evaluate the study and submit recommendations to the state within six months.
The Centre had moved the Supreme Court challenging the High Court directive, but the apex court had dismissed it. It had, however, allowed a period of one year to execute the high court order.Advertisement
With more than three years passing without the order being executed, the two petitioner outfits had moved the apex court alleging contempt of court.
* What are the petitioners citing?
They have cited the 1992 Supreme Court verdict in the Indra Sawhney case. First, it said that the criteria for a group to qualify for reservation is “social and educational backwardness”. Additionally, the court also reiterated the 50% limit to vertical quotas it had set out in earlier judgments – unless in “exceptional circumstances”.

The verdict led to the formation of backward commissions at the national and state levels. The National Commission for Backward Classes Act, under which the commissions were formed, stated that state governments should revise the list every 10 years. However, such a revision has not taken place in Kerala so far.
* What is the state government’s stand on caste census?Advertisement
Last week, the Kerala government told the Supreme Court that it could not proceed with this as the details of the socio-economic caste census conducted by the UPA government at the Centre had not been made public. Kerala added that in 2022, the state had asked the Union government to share the details with its backward class commission, and that in May 2023, the Centre had done the same.
However, Kerala argued, the report sent by the Centre was not helpful in identifying the social and economically backward classes in the state.
* What is the state Opposition’s stand?
The Congress, which has made the demand for a caste census central to its Lok Sabha campaign, is using it to attack the Kerala government. (Incidentally, as part of the INDIA coalition with the Congress, the CPI-M also backs a nationwide caste census.) The Congress also argues that irrespective of a nationwide census, the state could have carried out one.
While the 102nd Amendment of the Constitution passed in 2018, conferred the National Commission for Backward Classes powers regarding classifying backward classes, in May 2021, the Supreme Court held that only the President of India could specify these groups, even for a state.Advertisement
However, in August 2021, another amendment was brought in, the 105th to the Constitution, vesting those powers back to states.
The Congress-led UDF Opposition is pointing to this 105th amendment to argue that Kerala could generate its own backward classes list. It has also accused the Kerala government of trying to cover this up, and hence toeing the Union government’s line, which is against a caste census.
* Who are the loudest voices on the issue?
Since Bihar came out with a caste survey, demand has been growing in Kerala from among backward communities for a similar survey to deduce representation of weaker sections in government service. While the backward Hindu community organisations such as the SNDP Yogam and various Muslim organisations support a caste census in Kerala, upper caste Hindus, particularly the influential Nair Service Society, are vehemently opposed to such an exercise.
The Kerala government’s stand is seen as a bid to dodge the bullet by passing the buck on to the Centre, thus not alienating any section.",politics
"As a TMC strongman is arrested, why Mamata Banerjee’s party won’t be complaining","A Trinamool Congress (TMC) strongman, Arabul Islam was the Mamata Banerjee-led party’s face in Bhangar in West Bengal’s South 24 Parganas district for well over a decade. But, in a move that has surprised some, the Kolkata Police arrested the former MLA on Thursday in the murder case of an Indian Secular Front (ISF) worker registered eight months ago. While the ruling party claims that the arrest illustrates the impartiality of the police, belying the Opposition’s claims, the CPI(M) and the BJP have alleged it is a show the TMC is putting up before the Lok Sabha elections.
Arabul is accused in the murder case of ISF worker Mohammad Mohiuddin Molla, who was shot dead last June during the panchayat elections when he turned up at the block development office to file his nomination papers. The election confirmed that Arabul, who won Bhangar in 2006 for the TMC when the CPI(M)-led Left was almost a hegemonic force in Bengal politics, had been losing his touch.
In the panchayat elections, violence in Bhangar, which is a predominantly Muslim area, and the local anger against Arabul forced the TMC to bring in MLA Saokat Molla to oversee the local organisation. Molla, the Canning Purba MLA, is another heavyweight leader from the minority community in South 24 Parganas.Advertisement
But that was not enough as the ISF, in alliance with the CPI(M) and a local anti-land acquisition committee, gave the TMC a run for its money. Of the 218 seats in 10 gram panchayats of Bhangar-II block, the TMC won from 86 without a contest. Of the 132 seats that went to polls, the TMC won 63, the ISF 43, the Jomi Jibika Bastutantra Poribesh Rokkha Committee 18, the CPI(M) seven, and one seat was bagged by an Independent. This came two years after the party lost the Bhangar Assembly constituency.
With the Lok Sabha elections approaching and the stakes much higher, the TMC leadership did not want Arabul to spoil the party’s chances. Removing him from the equation allows the party to give Molla free rein in Bhangar, which is part of the crucial Jadavpur Lok Sabha constituency and in 2019 gave a massive lead to the party.
“Bhangar comes under the Jadavpur Lok Sabha constituency,” said a senior TMC leader. “Current MP Mimi Chakraborty got a lead of more than one lakh votes from Bhangar. But, given the situation in the last panchayat election, party leaders understood that the situation was precarious. The leadership wants Bhangar to be controlled by Soakat Molla but it would have been impossible had Arabul been there. We think that is why he was arrested.”
A controversial figure
In 2012, a professor at Bhangar College filed a complaint against Arabul for allegedly assaulting her — he was accused of throwing a water jug at her — and an FIR was lodged against the TMC leader. The following year, in January, the strongman was arrested for the first time and charged with attempted murder. He was accused of setting ablaze vehicles belonging to CPI(M) supporters protesting the assault on party leader and former minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah. In 2014, the TMC expelled the former MLA because of two deaths in an intra-party rivalry but he was reinstated two years later. In May 2018, he was arrested for another murder during the panchayat elections that year.Advertisement
But despite his strong-arm tactics, Arabul did not manage to regain the Assembly election ticket from Bhangar. In 2016, Abduar Rezzak Mollah won the constituency on a TMC ticket. Five years later, the party chose Dr Rezaul Karim, another former CPI(M) leader, over Arabul. This sparked a fight within the party and Karim lost the election to ISF’s Naushad Siddiqui, exposing the TMC’s tenuous hold on the area.
BJP and CPM target Trinamool
The Opposition, meanwhile, accused the ruling party of attempting to hoodwink the Election Commission (EC) before any action could be taken against Arabul before the parliamentary elections. “He will be brought out on bail just before the polls. All these are planned. The arrest was made before the EC took any action,” said Leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari of the BJP.
The CPI(M) pointed out that the former MLA had been arrested and expelled from the TMC earlier too but had been accepted in the ruling party’s ranks. “It all depends on Didi’s (Mamata Banerjee) wish when people like Arabul will be arrested or released,” said CPI(M) leader Sujan Chakraborty.
The TMC, however, claimed that the police followed their “raj dharma” by making the arrest. “The law will decide whether he is guilty or innocent. But this proves that the Opposition’s allegation that the police do not take action against anyone in the ruling party is not true,” said ruling party spokesperson Kunal Ghosh.",politics
"With Bharat Ratnas, Narendra Modi firms up a four-M Mantra – Mandal, Mandir, Market, MandiPremium Story","By conferring Bharat Ratna first on Karpoori Thakur and L K Advani, and now on former prime ministers P V Narasimha Rao and Choudhary Charan Singh, and agricultural scientist M S Swaminathan, it is evident that Narendra Modi will present a mantra including Mandal, Mandir, Market and Mandi (farmers) in the Big Battle of 2024 – taking a leaf out of the book of many a leader before him, but giving it a Modi touch.
Three of the leaders honoured by the Modi government are from the Opposition ranks – Bharatiya Lok Dal (now Rashtriya Lok Dal or RLD) leader Charan Singh, socialist ideologue Karpoori Thakur, and Rao, the first non-Gandhi family leader of the Congress to complete a term as PM. The BJP under Modi has been co-opting leaders from outside the party and adding them to its pantheon, whether Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel or Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose earlier, and these personalities now.

Swaminathan, the Father of the Green Revolution, is associated with Indira Gandhi. She initiated the process towards self-reliance on food production after she went to the US soon after becoming PM in 1966, and American headlines greeted her with ‘An Indian PM comes with a begging bowl’.Advertisement
Mandal in the Modi Mantra stands for the importance given to OBCs under his government, with the PM himself an OBC. Karpoori Thakur and Charan Singh both belonged to backward classes, with Thakur really the father of the Mandal phenomenon. As chief minister of Bihar in 1978, he introduced 26% reservation for OBCs in government jobs, and when the decision was met with violent protests, he decided to set aside 3% for the EWS (economically weaker sections) and another 3% for women – a harbinger of things to come in later years.

A Bharat Ratna to Thakur also gave a fig leaf to his protege and JD(U) supremo Nitish Kumar to walk back into the BJP fold. The Bihar CM claimed he had written to successive governments at the Centre to give the socialist icon the country’s highest civilian award, and that it was the Modi government that finally did it.
The reaction of RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary was along the same lines, reacting to the Bharat Ratna to his grandfather Charan Singh with the remark, “Dil Jeet Liya (Won hearts!)”. This comes amidst talk of the RLD and BJP almost concluding their talks on an alliance, with the RLD getting at least two Lok Sabha seats and one in the Rajya Sabha.

With Charan Singh, Modi covered the ‘Mandi’ gap. The BJP has been worried about the disaffection among farmers, particularly Jats, in western Uttar Pradesh, and hopes that the entry of RLD – carrying the legacy of farmer leader Charan Singh – may stem that. West UP accounts for 29 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state. Charan Singh was responsible for the downfall of the Congress in UP, amidst the rise of the OBCs, and was as much a leader of the Yadavs as Jats.Advertisement
The late Jaipal Reddy, a minister in the UPA government, used to say that there were two mass leaders in North India – Indira Gandhi and Charan Singh. And the late farmer leader is still a household name in western UP.
For the BJP, the UP fight is not so much winning the maximum seats in the state, which it is confident of doing, but of raising its tally from 64 currently to beyond the 71 figure it reached in 2014.

The Mandir in the Modi mantra is exemplified by the Bharat Ratna to Advani. Given the sidelining and bitterness of the veteran leader under the Modi government, the honour was a surprise. A founder of the BJP along with Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Advani was also the man who led the Rath Yatra turning the Ayodhya Ram temple demand into a political movement.
With the Bharat Ratna to Advani, Modi sent a suitable signal of magnanimity to the party’s workers, while also underlining his confidence in his own absolute unassailability.Advertisement
Come now to the ‘Market’, and that explains the nod to Narasimha Rao, the father of the economic reforms in India, who took tough decisions to open up the economy soon after taking over as PM in 1991. But Rao’s importance also lies in him being from South India, a “Telugu bidda” from Andhra Pradesh, with the Modi government going out of its way to reach out to the region. (Swaminathan incidentally is a fellow South Indian, from Tamil Nadu.)
The BJP has seen many virtues in Rao since his death, underlining how the Gandhi family had shunned him, ostensibly for “letting” the Babri Masjid demolition happen under him in 1992. His body was not even allowed to be kept at the AICC headquarters in Delhi for Congress colleagues to pay their last respects to him. The BJP has made another stride towards owning Rao now, and acknowledging his achievement in stabilising the country when it was aflame with Mandal and Mandir conflicts, and facing strife in Jammu and Kashmir.
These five men who have been honoured in the last couple of weeks were not flawless leaders, nor did the country become free of problems under their stewardship. Some of them even took decisions which deepened the existing fault lines. But they have all arguably been ratnas of Bharat.",politics

The decision comes amid opposition from state minister and OBC leader Chhagan Bhujbal, who claims Marathas will be granted “backdoor entry” into the OBC quota.
Meanwhile, in Nagpur, the tribal Gowari Gond community is set to hold a meeting on Saturday and “intensify the stir” if the government does not meet their demands for caste certificates.

"BJP delighted host as after Chandrababu Naidu, ‘friendly’ Jagan comes calling","The meeting of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy with Prime Minister Narendra Modi Friday indicates that the BJP is spoiled for choice when it comes to Andhra Pradesh, with the state’s ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) keen on friendly ties and the main Opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP) expecting to be welcomed back into the NDA fold.
The long-overdue meeting, during which Jagan reportedly repeated the demand for Special Category Status for Andhra, lasted around 30 minutes and went off well, the CM told reporters.
Jagan’s meeting with Modi incidentally followed immediately after discussions between the PM, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP national president J P Nadda in the new Parliament building.

The development would have been watched closely by TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu, who has been in the national capital for a couple of days, and earlier met Shah. Sources from both sides indicated later that the BJP had clinched a deal with the TDP and its ally Jana Sena Party (JSP) for the simultaneous Assembly and Lok Sabha polls coming up in Andhra.
Under Jagan, the YSRCP has extended support to the BJP at the Centre on its legislative initiatives on almost every critical occasion. However, a section in the BJP has reportedly been miffed with him for holding back on a formal alliance. The YSRCP, which enjoys the support of the minorities in the state, is believed to have been wary that an alliance could affect its prospects both in the state and national elections.
Sources said Jagan’s remarks earlier this week that he wishes that no party comes to power with an absolute majority in the next Lok Sabha elections – as that left states with little bargaining power – also did not go down well with the BJP. Another black mark against the YSRCP chief is believed to have been the dramatic arrest of Naidu in the alleged skill development corporation scam amidst the Modi government’s showpiece G20 Summit last September.
The YSRCP, however, is keen on getting on the right side of the BJP, and its leaders said the party would not go into attacks against the BJP even if it eventually allies with the TDP-JSP. “Why should we attack the BJP? We have an equidistance policy,” a senior party leader said.Advertisement
Incidentally, Jagan too is facing the heat from central agencies, while the party is conscious of the risk of poaching by the BJP. According to sources, at least two sitting MPs are in “discussions” with the BJP to migrate. Two MPs recently quit the party – Raghu Rama Krishna Raju (Narasapuram), and Lavu Sri Krishna Devarayalu (Narasaraopet).
In the case of the TDP, while it is ready to share five to six seats with the BJP for the Lok Sabha polls, the BJP, which is keen to win the maximum seats on its own symbol, has demanded more, sources said. Talks have reportedly been on between the two parties for several months, and further discussions will now be held on the division of seats. Naidu may not put up much of a resistance as, sources said, he wants to regain the “trust and support of the BJP leadership” to “protect the interests of his party”, while fighting to return to power.
The BJP central leadership sees it as only a win-win as friendly ties with the YSRCP plus an official alliance with the TDP-JSP would assure at least some of the 25 Lok Sabha seats in Andhra, where the party’s prospects are otherwise seen as grim. In 2019, the YSRCP had won 22 of the seats and the TDP 3.
The state BJP unit, though, has had reservations regarding a tie-up. Many state leaders believe going it alone is better for the BJP to strengthen its cadre and spread its roots in the southern state.Advertisement
The Congress, which had been reduced to a mere spectator in the previous Lok Sabha and Assembly polls in the state having won no seats, will be hoping that a friendly triangular contest between the BJP, TDP and YSRCP could come to its benefit. It is also pumped after its win next door in the Telangana Assembly polls last year.",politics
"Decode Politics: 20 days to go for state board exams, why is Tripura staring at protests","THE controversy over the script to use for answering question papers by those who have taken Kokborok as the second optional language in the Tripura state board rages on. The confusion is yet to be cleared even as the exams for Class 10 and 12 to be held by the Tripura Board of Secondary Education (TBSE) are now less than a month away, to be held on March 1 and 2, respectively.
On Friday, Leader of the Opposition Animesh Debbarma of the TIPRA Motha party urged Chief Minister Manik Saha that students be given the option of both Bengali and Roman scripts – as has been the practice. Later in the day, tribal student body Tipra Indigenous Students Federation (TISF), the student wing of the opposition TIPRA Motha party, announced indefinite statewide road and railway blockade from February 12 against the TBSE move to disallow Roman script for writing the board exams in Kokborok.
TIPRA Motha supremo Pradyot Kishore Manikya earlier demanded that TBSE president Dhananjoy Gonchowdhury be removed if students were not given both the options.
What is the controversy?Advertisement
Kokborok, the lingua franca of most of Tripura’s 19 recognised tribes, does not have a script. However, it has been taught in state schools, colleges and universities since 1979, when it was recognised as an official state language, and exams on Kokborok language as a subject have been conducted since 1983.
Candidates earlier used to write their Kokborok exams in both Bengali and Roman scripts. The controversy arose after some exam centres last year insisted that students not use the Roman script. Many candidates, especially those who had studied Kokborok in the Roman script, turned in blank sheets and sought reexamination.
This became a political issue as it was seen as a further imposition of Bengali in a state where the original tribal population now stands overwhelmed by “migrants”. It was also seen as a reflection of the “outsider” BJP’s rise in the state, and in its election manifesto last year, the TIPRA Motha, which is the main tribal party of Tripura, promised to ensure that Roman script was retained for writing Kokborok.
Why has it flared up now?
On January 30, Gonchowdhury said that Roman script would not be allowed for the Kokborok exam in the coming board exams. One of the reasons he cited was the lack of enough qualified evaluators to check Kokborok answer-sheets written in the Roman script.Advertisement
This led to protests, including by the TIPRA Motha as well as an organisation of 56 tribal organisations called the ‘Roman Script for Kokborok Choba (RSKC)’ which is led by noted Kokborok litterateur Bikash Rai Debbarma. The TIPRA Motha warned the Manik Saha government to revise the decision, or face law and order problems.
Following a week of protests, on February 6, TBSE head Gonchowdhury declared that students would be allowed to give their Kokborok exams in both the scripts. By then, over 130 faculty members from different colleges and universities had submitted a written undertaking to evaluate Kokborok answer sheets in Roman script.
Also read | After weeks of protests and exchange of barbs, TBSE allows both Roman, Bengali scripts for Kokborok exam in Tripura
Gonchowdhury added that the board would arrange proper evaluation in both the scripts. “The exams commence in 20 days. It’s not fair to have examinees stay in anxiety… We shall arrange for proper evaluation for both the scripts based on whatever guideline comes from the Centre.”
At the same time, he didn’t issue any written order regarding use of the Roman script.Advertisement
Pradyot Kishore went live on social media to claim the board had backtracked due to pressure from tribal students and civil society.
Then, a day later, on February 7, Gonchowdhury made another flip, telling mediapersons in a video message that his comments had been “misinterpreted”. “What I wanted to say was that the school education department had written to the CBSE about the issue. So far, the CBSE hasn’t conveyed its decision, without which, whatever method was in force in the TBSE earlier, will continue,” he said.
Gonchowdhury further added that with education an item in the Concurrent List, the state education board had been following the CBSE curricula since 2020, in line with the Centre’s attempt at uniformity in education systems across the country with its New Education Policy (NEP).
Soon after, TIPRA Motha president and former MLA Bijoy Kumar Hrangkhawl said: “If the government wants to treat this sensitive issue with a soft touch, good. We don’t welcome violence. But there will be student protests otherwise, which would be unfortunate.”Advertisement

What is the state board chief’s defence on his flip-flop?
On Thursday, Gonchowdhury said: “When I instructed exam centre in-charges on January 29-30 that they should only allow the Bengali script, there were protests. Many people threatened to disturb the exam process. To avoid confrontation, I said on Tuesday that I would allow both the scripts. But I got a call from my ‘higher authority in Delhi’ the same night that the CBSE had asked the state government to maintain the status quo till a final decision was taken. I am helpless, and will only allow the Bengali script for now.”
What will happen now?
Protests have begun again, by TIPRA Motha MLAs inside the Assembly and other tribal groups outside.
Bikash Rai Debbarma, the tribal litterateur, said that the TBSE’s arguments had no basis. “The CBSE is a different entity from the TBSE. I don’t understand why the TBSE is waiting for a CBSE guideline. It seems the state education board is relinquishing its responsibility.”Advertisement
Motha leader Animesh Debbarma said, “Is the TBSE running on instructions of the CBSE? The TBSE is a state body. Education is in the Concurrent List, and since Kokborok is a local language, the state government is better placed to understand the issues.”
Reached out for his comments, BJP spokesperson Nabendu Bhattacharya said he didn’t have anything to say.
Swapan Debbarma, the general secretary of the Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (IPFT), the tribal party that is an ally of the BJP, said on Friday that his party has been demanding both the Roman and Bengali scripts for Kokborok language exams for a long time.
He said an IPFT delegation had earlier submitted a memorandum to Dr Manik Saha, in response to which the CM had assured he would look into the matter. For now, the BJP’s tribal partner says it will wait till February 10 — when the TBSE is scheduled to issue its exam notification — to see if both Roman and Bengali scripts are allowed.",politics
"Message to farmers, strike at Congress, as Modi govt announces 3 more Bharat Ratnas","In a third announcement of Bharat Ratnas within a fortnight, the government on Friday named three more recipients for the country’s highest civilian award — former prime ministers Chaudhary Charan Singh and P V Narasimha Rao, and celebrated agricultural economist M S Swaminathan.
Days ago, the Modi government had awarded Bharat Ratnas to Karpoori Thakur and L K Advani — honouring both the former’s social justice legacy, especially for EBCs, and the Hindutva legacy of the BJP exemplified by the latter.
The honour for Charan Singh, Rao and Swaminathan is similarly replete with political messaging on several levels in the run-up to the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, continuing a Modi-era trend when it comes to State awards.Advertisement

At five, one more than the four announced in 1999, this is the maximum number of Bharat Ratnas announced in a year.
Charan Singh was a prominent farmer leader with a strong base among the Jats of western UP. In offering him the highest civilian award, the Modi government has reached out to farmers of north India in general and the Jat community of western UP, Rajasthan and Haryana in particular. Significantly, the Jats of Haryana and western UP were at the forefront of the year-long agitation against the three farm laws legislated in 2021, on the borders of the national capital, eventually forcing Prime Minister Narendra Modi to announce their withdrawal.
The award comes at a time when there is growing speculation about the Rashtriya Lok Dal, set up by Charan Singh’s son Ajit Singh and now led by his grandson Jayant Choudhury, breaking away from the Opposition INDIA bloc to join the NDA. “Dil jeet liya (You’ve won my heart),” Jayant posted soon after the announcement of the award.

दिल जीत लिया! #BharatRatna https://t.co/Ns0CraJ7yI
— Jayant Singh (@jayantrld) February 9, 2024

Earlier, after the Bharat Ratna was named for Karpoori Thakur, who had pioneered EBC reservation in Bihar, the JD(U) split from INDIA and joined the NDA.Advertisement
But the symbolism of the award to Charan Singh does not stop here. The farmer leader spent 38 years in the Congress before splitting the party in UP after it failed to get a majority in the 1967 state Assembly elections, and walked out with 16 MLAs. He then became the Chief Minister with the support of the Jana Sangh — the BJP’s forerunner — along with the socialists, the Communists and the Swatantra Party.
While that government proved short-lived, it didn’t halt Charan Singh. He returned as CM for another short tenure in 1970 with the support of the Congress.
After some more experiments with other parties, in 1977, post the Emergency, Charan Singh again found himself in the opposite ranks to the Congress, joining the Janata Party, which was formed by the merger of various Opposition parties including the Jana Sangh. He was Deputy Prime Minister in the Janata government that came to power, in which later BJP luminaries Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L K Advani were also ministers. Once the Janata started cracking due to its ideological contradictions, Charan Singh quit.
This time, he became PM for a brief while with the support of Indira Gandhi’s Congress.Advertisement
The Bharat Ratna to Charan Singh hence is recognition for a leader who stood up against the Congress, and was a co-traveller of the Jana Sangh for some years. In his post on the Bharat Ratna, Modi said Charan Singh’s “deep dedication to our farmer brothers and sisters and his commitment to democracy during the Emergency are an inspiration for the whole country”.
The outreach to farmers is further exemplified in the award to M S Swaminathan. It was the Swaminathan Committee that recommended in 2006 that the MSP should be 1.5 times the cost of production that a farmer incurs. He is also credited as the architect of the Green Revolution in the 1960s, making India self-reliant in foodgrain production. “Dr Swaminathan’s visionary leadership has not only transformed Indian agriculture but also ensured the nation’s food security and prosperity,” the PM posted.

However, the most significant choice for the Bharat Ratna Friday was former PM P V Narasimha Rao, the second life-long Congress leader to be honoured with this award by the Modi government after Pranab Mukherjee. Significantly, both the leaders had a testy relationship with the Gandhi family, and the Modi government honour for Rao comes just at a time when the PM has stepped up his attacks on the Congress, particularly the Gandhis. It fits into the BJP narrative that Congress leaders who don’t have the Gandhi family’s blessings don’t get too far in the party or find themselves pushed to the sidelines.
For the BJP, the honour to Rao also serves more purposes as he is seen as the liberator of the Indian economy, as well as the PM who many believe “let” the Babri Masjid demolition happen in 1992. While the Congress did not acknowledge Rao for a long time after his term as PM ended, the Bharat Ratna serves well the BJP claim that the Congress had mismanaged the economy, while tacitly honouring a leader who ended up giving a huge push to the Ram Temple movement, which made full circle recently with the consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.Advertisement
Modi wrote on X, “As a distinguished scholar and statesman, Narasimha Rao Garu served India extensively in various capacities… (His) tenure as Prime Minister was marked by significant measures that opened India to global markets, fostering a new era of economic development.”

What would also have been on the BJP’s mind are the coming Andhra Pradesh Assembly elections, held simultaneously with the Lok Sabha. Rao, who belonged to the Telangana region, remains the pride of Andhra as the only leader from the unified state to have ever become PM. He was also the CM of unified Andhra.
The BJP, which is seeking to increase its Lok Sabha tally in the South, is currently in talks with both the ruling YSRCP and the main opposition TDP in Andhra, underlining its own importance for the two parties.
The others conferred Bharat Ratna since Modi came to power in 2014 include educationist, freedom fighter and once-Congress president Madan Mohan Malviya; Vajpayee; Assamese singer and musician Bhupen Hazarika; and RSS leader Nanaji Deshmukh.

The new ‘Lokpal of India’? Justice A M Khanwilkar penned several orders key for Modi govt,"After a gap of nearly two years, the new chairperson of the Lokpal is set to be appointed, with the selection committee shortlisting the name of former Supreme Court Justice A M Khanwilkar.
If appointed, Khanwilkar, 66, would only be the second chairperson of the Lokpal, known as the ‘Lokpal of India’. The first chairperson was former Supreme Court Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghose, who held the office from March 2019 and retired in May 2022. Former Jharkhand High Court Chief Justice Pradip Kumar Mohanty has been the Acting Chairperson since.
Justice Khanwilkar, who had an over six-year stint in the Supreme Court, from May 2016 to when he retired in July 2022, was part of several key judgments, from the decriminalisation of homosexuality to tightening rules regarding foreign funding of NGOs, to upholding the constitutional validity of the strict provisions in the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), and upholding the Special Investigation Team’s clean chit to then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and 63 others in the 2002 Gujarat 2002 riots.Advertisement
Appointed as a judge of the Bombay High Court in March 2000, Khanwilkar served as Chief Justice of the Himachal Pradesh High Court and Madhya Pradesh High Court, before being elevated to the Supreme Court.
Soon after, he was a part of the majority ruling in the five-judge Bench that decided to decriminalise homosexuality. In 2018, he was part of another Constitution Bench decision, in which the Court held that the right to die with dignity formed an integral part of the right to life and liberty under Article 21, thus legalising passive euthanasia for patients with terminal illnesses.
In September 2018, Justice Khanwilkar was part of the five-judge Constitution Benches in the landmark Aadhaar and Sabarimala cases. While the Court upheld the constitutional validity of Aadhaar, in the Sabarimala case, by 4:1 majority, it expanded the right to equality, allowing girls and women of all ages to visit the Sabarimala temple in Kerala.

In 2020, Justice Khanwilkar authored the decision to uphold the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment Act, 2020. The amended Act had a drastic effect on the functioning of NGOs and other organisations by placing stringent restrictions on how foreign funds could be utilised.Advertisement
In 2021, he authored the three-judge Bench judgment establishing the protocol that state governments must follow before reserving seats in local bodies. As per the conditions, governments must first set up a committee to study the backwardness of different communities, specify the proportion of reservation, and ensure that the total reservation does not exceed 50%.
In June 2022, Khanwilkar was part of the bench that upheld the SIT clean chit to Modi and others in the 2002 riots case, which had been challenged by Zakia Jafri. The Supreme Court held that Jafri, whose husband Ahsan Jafri was killed in the riots, had pursued the proceedings to “keep the pot boiling, obviously, for ulterior design” and said “all those involved in such abuse of process, need to be in the dock”. The next day, the Gujarat Police had arrested activist Teesta Setalvad and former IPS officer on charges of fabricating evidence linked to the riots.
A month later, on July 27, 2022, two days before his retirement, Justice Khanwilkar delivered the judgment upholding the constitutionality of the PMLA, 2002, granting wide investigative powers to the Enforcement Directorate, doing away with the “presumption of innocence” for accused persons, and providing restrictive conditions for anyone seeking bail under this Act.
As a judge of the Supreme Court, Justice Khanwilkar wrote 226 judgments – only three judges wrote more – and was a part of 817 Benches, as per data collected by the Supreme Court Observer. While he authored judgments on a range of subjects, he most frequently wrote on criminal, civil and constitutional matters.Advertisement
At the time of his retirement, then Chief Justice N V Ramana called Khanwilkar a “hard-working and disciplined judge” and “a strong proponent for the use of technology” in the judiciary.
Before he became a judge, Khanwilkar worked as a lawyer, enrolling as an advocate in 1982 and practising exclusively in the Supreme Court from 1984 onwards. He represented the State of Maharashtra, his home state, first as a Standing Counsel and then as an Additional Government Advocate. He also served as the Standing Counsel for the Election Commission of India.
During his 18 years as an advocate, he assisted the apex court in a variety of matters. In the landmark M C Mehta v Union of India (1996) case, in which the court tackled the pollution of the Ganga river due to effluents from surrounding tanneries, Khanwilkar was appointed as amicus curiae to assist the court on environmental issues
The Lokpal, which possesses the powers to investigate, prosecute and occasionally constitute benches to hear cases of corruption against public officials connected with the Central government, was established following the enactment of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013.

"Decode Politics: How Punjab came to be among first states to sub-categorise SCs, and has been fighting to retain it","A seven-judge Bench of the Supreme Court Wednesday reserved its judgment on the permissibility of sub-classification within SC/ST reservations. The Court is examining whether its judgment in E V Chinnaiah vs State of Andhra Pradesh & Others (2004) — where it ruled that Scheduled Castes (SCs) form a homogenous class and that there cannot be any subdivision among them — needs a relook.
The hearing has thrown a spotlight on Punjab, which has also moved the top court to reconsider its 2004 judgment. Punjab, which has the largest proportion of Dalits in its population, was among the first states in the country to make provisions for sub-categorisation within the SC community and also passed a Bill for the same.
Must Read  | How the legal debate over sub-categorisation among SCs has evolved over the years
A look at the context that led to the SC sub-categorisation in Punjab, and where the state currently stands on the issue:
The first moveAdvertisement
In 1975, when the Congress was in power in the state under Giani Zail Singh, the Punjab government issued a circular which reserved 50% jobs within the 25% quota for SCs for members of the Valmiki and Mazhabi Sikh communities. It was reasoned that some SC communities were cornering the benefits of reservation, while backward communities such as the Valmikis and Mazhabi Sikhs had been left behind.
A Bill is brought in
This circular continued to function until 2006. In July that year, the Punjab and Haryana High Court struck it down in a judgment titled Dr Kishan Pal v. State of Punjab. The circular was challenged in the backdrop of the E.V. Chinnaiah v State of Andhra Pradesh case (2004), where a five-judge Supreme Court Bench struck down the Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Castes (Rationalisation of Reservations) Act, 2000, for violating the right to equality. The Andhra law contained an expansive list of SC communities identified in the state and the quota provided to each of them.
Even as the case regarding the notification was being heard in the Punjab and Haryana High Court, Mazhabis and Valmikis protested, alleging that another SC community, the Ravidassias, were influencing the case. The allegation was specifically directed at then Punjab minister Chaudhary Jagjit Singh, a Ravidassia.

Subsequently, in September 2006, then Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, heading a Congress government, brought a Bill in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha to “protect and safeguard the reservation rights of the Valmikis and Mazhabi Sikhs”. This was called ‘The Punjab Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes (Reservation in Services) Act, 2006’. It was passed unanimously, though a few members of the Opposition alleged that Singh’s move was aimed at appeasing voters.Advertisement
Singh argued that the Bill would safeguard the rights of the Mazhbis and Valmikis who “fall at the bottom of the reservation pyramid and mostly remain left out from the benefit due to their extreme educational and economic backwardness”.
The provisions of the Act
It set aside 50% of the jobs reserved in the SC quota for Valmikis and Mazhabi Sikhs, “as first preference from amongst the Scheduled Castes”. The other 37 SC communities in the state were given the rest of the reservation pie.
One reason for the protest by the other Dalit communities, such as Ravidassias, Adharmi, Bazigar, Mochi, Megh and others, was that the Valmikis and Mazhabis were getting the chunk of the benefits despite comprising only 12.61% of the SC population.
What happened to the Act?
In 2010, the Act was challenged by the Chamar Mahasabha in the High Court, and its Section 4(5), providing 50% reservation to the Valmikis and Mazhabi Sikhs, struck down by a Division Bench on March 29 that year.Advertisement
After this, the Valmikis organised statewide protests, seeking restoration of their quota in jobs and educational institutions.
In July 2010, a delegation under the banner of the Valmiki and Mazhabi Sikh Arakshan Bachao Morcha, and other organizations, met then CM Parkash Singh Badal of the Akali Dal on the matter, and was assured that the government would move the Supreme Court and take up the issue with the Prime Minister.
The state went to the Supreme Court the same year and got a stay on the High Court order. In 2014, the Punjab government again moved the Supreme Court, now against the High Court ruling, arguing that the Supreme Court had in 2004 incorrectly concluded that SCs could not be sub-classified.
The case thus came to be referred to Constitution Benches. In 2020, a Constitution Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra held that the Supreme Court’s 2004 decision in E V Chinnaiah required reconsideration.
What has Punjab argued before the SC?Advertisement
Punjab’s Advocate General Gurminder Singh has argued that “reservation was a tool the State could use to reduce inequality”, that “it was not an act of charity or benevolence” and that “inequality had another layer”. “It is no longer only about the advantaged and the disadvantaged but also about the disadvantaged and the more disadvantaged,” he has said.
Punjab is also arguing that the President identified SCs in an Order in 1950, and that Parliament had the power to include and exclude certain categories from this list. States, on the other hand, he argued, had the right and obligation to further demarcate communities within this group based on “relative backwardness”.",politics
"Bharat Ratna for P V Narasimha Rao: Congress’s Achilles heel, the PM it ‘forgot’","Speaking in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a pointed attack on the Congress. He said the party never considered B R Ambedkar worthy of the Bharat Ratna and kept giving the honour to their “own family members”. He said the Congress, which named parks, streets, and squares after its “family members”, is now giving the BJP advice and lessons on social justice.
The government’s surprise decision to award Bharat Ratna to former PM P V Narasimha Rao of the Congress and earlier to former President Pranab Mukherjee, another Congress leader, fits well into the BJP’s larger political narrative. That the grand old party has always ignored its stalwarts outside the Gandhi family and played down their contributions to the country.
Must Read  | In Bharat Ratna for Advani, PM Modi pulls another ace
And Rao has always been an Achilles heel for the Congress, given the fraught relations Sonia Gandhi shared with him when the former was Prime Minister. The demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992 under his watch as PM was another sore point. The decision to honour him with Bharat Ratna comes, interestingly, weeks after the opening of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.Advertisement
The Congress shunned Rao after he demitted office in 1996 after an eventful tenure that not just saw the Babri demolition but also the unshackling of the Indian economy and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) bribery scandal. For years, the Congress refused to acknowledge Rao’s role in opening up the Indian economy, the biggest reforms India has seen since independence.
The Congress in recent years, however, made a conscious attempt to include Rao in the pantheon of Congress icons. It surprised many when Sonia lavished praise on the former PM in 2020, recounting his leadership skills and asserting that the party takes pride in his many accomplishments and contributions. Responding to Modi’s announcement, Sonia on Friday said, “I welcome it. Why not?”

The praise in 2020 was a refreshing break from the past, personally for her and politically for the party. By awarding Bharat Ratna to Rao, days after it honoured L K Advani with the highest civilian award, Modi hopes to sharpen his political messaging and the narrative that the BJP has not forgotten its stalwarts even when they have walked into the twilight of their political lives and has honoured a former Congress PM who his own forgot.
While Advani was at the centre of the Ram Temple movement, fingers were often pointed at Rao for the Babri Masjid demolition.Advertisement
What went wrong between Sonia and Rao?
Sonia’s relations with Rao were frosty. And awarding the Bharat Ratna to him will result in refreshing memories and retelling of history. All this just months ahead of Lok Sabha elections, a topic the Congress will not want to be revisited.

The reasons for the UPA chairperson’s ties with Rao turning sour are a mix of many — personal, political, and perhaps ideological. Rao is the first PM outside the Nehru-Gandhi family to last a full term in office. And, ironically, he continues to be the only one from the Congress who does not have a memorial in the national capital. His body was not even allowed inside the 24, Akbar Road headquarters of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) when he died in December 2004, with his cortege parked on the pavement outside the main gate.
The Congress had pinned the blame for its defeat in the 1996 Lok Sabha election on Rao. And he was soon marginalised and forgotten. Rather, the party under the leadership of the Gandhis chose to forget Rao as well as his contributions.
Must Read  | Vinay Sitapati writes: Bharat Ratna for Advani shows why BJP wins — and Congress loses
Some of the reasons cited for Sonia’s disenchantment with Rao are real, some are hearsay, and some are intelligent conjectures. Whatever they may be, the bitterness was real.Advertisement
Rao was a senior minister in the Rajiv Gandhi government and had no plans to stay in Delhi after the 1991 Lok Sabha elections. He virtually decided to retire from active politics and move back to Hyderabad as soon as the elections were over. But Rajiv’s assassination upended all those plans.
With the likes of N D Tiwari, Arjun Singh, and Sharad Pawar throwing the hat in the ring, the selection of the next PM was turning out to be a difficult task for the Congress. Sonia had earlier declined the party’s proposal to take over as Congress president after Rajiv’s assassination. She was not interested in the PM’s post either.

It is said those close to the Gandhi family — the likes of M L Fotedar and R K Dhawan — were against Tiwari, Singh, and Pawar. They favoured the “harmless” Rao. Singh too withdrew from the race later and favoured Rao to checkmate Pawar. But Rao was not Sonia’s first choice. She preferred the then vice president Shankar Dayal Sharma. However she did not object to Rao’s elevation and endorsed the proposal.
A Congress leader who was a minister in the Manmohan Singh government was witness to Rao’s meeting with Sonia after it was decided he would be the next Prime Minister. The leader, who happened to be there to meet V George at 10, Janpath, recalls that “when the door was opened for Rao to go in and meet Mrs Gandhi, Rao lay down prostrate on the floor”. It was his way of telling Sonia that he would remain loyal to her.
But the equations soon changed.Advertisement
“The first break happened soon sometime in 1992. S Bangarappa was the Chief Minister of Karnataka. He wanted George, who was the private secretary of Rajiv Gandhi, to be given a Rajya Sabha ticket because George was instrumental in making him the CM. But Rao had other ideas. He wanted the ticket to be given to another leader. He skilfully tossed it into Gandhi’s court saying if she says I will give it to George. Gandhi was in a different state of mind. She never said yes and she never said no and the ticket went to the person who Rao wanted.”
It is said that the arrest of George’s brother-in-law in a TADA case was another pinprick. But the serious differences soon followed.

The demolition of the Babri Masjid became the rallying point for the likes of Arjun Singh and Tiwari to openly take on Rao. It is said that those close to Sonia at that time tacitly backed Singh and Tiwari. It was seen as backing by 10, Janpath. Singh and Tiwari used to meet Sonia to complain about the PM, which upset Rao. It is said that Singh and Tiwari had the blessings of 10, Janpath when they led an abortive political coup against Rao.
But things came to a head in 1995. Sonia was upset over the slow progress in the investigation into Rajiv’s assassination case.Advertisement
“Gandhi had a meeting with the then Sri Lankan president Chandrika Kumaratunga. They shared a strong emotional bond. Talking about her husband’s assassination and the involvement of some LTTE elements who were now wandering freely around in Sri Lanka, Chandrika had mentioned in passing that India had not even sought their extradition … I think at that point she felt very disturbed,” a senior leader said.
In August of 1995, Gandhi openly accused the Rao government of going slow on the investigation into her husband’s assassination. “She felt he did not want the inquiry to proceed,” said a senior leader. So, Sonia shared an uneasy relationship with Rao even before she entered active politics, the leader added.
The rest is history. Rao was replaced by Sitaram Kesri as the Congress president after the party’s defeat in 1996. Two years later, he was denied a ticket in the 1998 Lok Sabha elections. Kesri declared the party would not give him a ticket because of his failure to protect the Babri Masjid.
And when Sonia took over as Congress president in 1998, she and those close to her ensured that Rao didn’t get a pride of place. It became natural for the party not to include his photograph at AICC plenary sessions alongside the pictures of other former Congress PMs. And the bitterness continued till his death and after.Advertisement
Vinay Sitapati in his book Half Lion: How P.V. Narasimha Rao Transformed India writes that Rao’s family wanted him to be cremated in Delhi. He quotes Rao’s son Prabhakara as saying, “Soniaji did not want … him to be seen as an all-India leader.”
Campaigning during the Telangana Assembly polls last November, Modi said in Karimnagar that the region knows how “talent” had been insulted by “family arrogance”. He said, “This land gave the country a prime minister in the form of P V Narasimha Rao. But the Congress’s royal family didn’t like it and insulted him every stop of the way. That is not all. Even after Rao’s death, the Congress’s royal family did not leave a single opportunity to insult Rao.”",politics
Bharat Ratna for Chaudhary Charan Singh: Former PM who championed farmers’ causes,"The Centre on Friday announced it would award the Bharat Ratna posthumously to former Prime Minister and farmer leader Chaudhary Charan Singh.
“It is an honour of our government that former Prime Minister of the country Chaudhary Charan Singh is being honoured with Bharat Ratna. This honour is dedicated to his incomparable contribution to the country,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote on X, announcing the award for Singh.
Modi said Singh dedicated his entire life to farmers’ rights and welfare. “Be it the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh or the Home Minister of the country and even as an MLA, he always gave impetus to nation building. He also stood firmly against the Emergency. His dedication to our farmer brothers and sisters and his commitment to democracy during the Emergency is inspiring to the entire nation,” said the PM.Advertisement
The PM also announced Bharat Ratna for former PM P V Narasimha Rao and agriculture scientist Dr MS Swaminathan. “This exemplifies the Modi government’s commitment to the agricultural sector, as reflected by the selection of two out of three awardees, Chaudhary Charan Singh and Dr M S Swaminathan, who have significantly championed the cause of agriculture,” said a source.

The source added, “Two of the awardees, Narasimha Rao and Chaudhary Charan Singh, come from non-BJP backgrounds, indicating Prime Minister Modi’s belief in conferring national honours in a very party-agnostic manner.”
The Bharat Ratna for Chaudhary Charan Singh comes at a time when there are talks of Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) headed by Singh’s grandson Jayant Chaudhary joining the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. Though the RLD does not have a single Lok Sabha MP, the party has its base among farmers and the Jat community in west Uttar Pradesh. Responding to the PM’s announcement, Jayant Chaudhary posted on X, “Dil jeet liya (Won my heart).”
Rise in UP politics
Chaudhary Charan Singh was born in a family of farmers in the village of Noorpur in Uttar Pradesh’s Meerut district in 1902. He was first elected to the UP Assembly in 1937 from Chhaprauli. In June 1951, he became a state Cabinet minister — a stepping stone to his rise to the highest political office in the country.Advertisement
At the time, he was one of the Congress’s main leaders in UP. But dissatisfied with the direction of the party, Singh left the Congress to form the first non-Congress government in UP. He also formed the Bharatiya Kranti Dal (BKD). Singh served as UP Chief Minister twice — first, from April 3, 1967, to February 25, 1968; and second from February 18, 1970, to October 1, 1970. After that, he became more involved in national politics.

In 1974, he merged his party with the Samyukta (United) Socialist Party to form the Bharatiya Lok Dal (BLD). At the time, Indira Gandhi was the prime minister and an almost invincible political force. When Gandhi declared Emergency the following year, Singh, like other prominent Opposition leaders, was imprisoned for a year.
Following the revocation of Emergency, the BLD emerged as a crucial component of the Morarji Desai-led Janata Party government that came to power in 1977. The Janata Party was formed that January year but merged with four Opposition parties — the Congress (Organisation), the BLD, the Jana Sangh, and the Socialist Party — after the elections in March. In the polls, the BLD got a majority, winning 295 of the 405 seats it contested. The Congress was routed, registering its worst performance since Independence as it won only 154 seats of the 492 it contested.
Singh became the Union Home Minister, holding the portfolio from March 24, 1977, to July 1, 1978. With discord in the party increasing, Desai appointed Singh the Deputy PM and Minister of Finance on January 24, 1979. He remained in the post till July 16.
170 days as PMAdvertisement
With internal fights showing no signs of abating, Desai stepped down as PM. The Janata Party split and the Janata Party (Secular) was formed. This was the beginning of the end of the Janata experiment. Singh staked his claim to form the government with the Congress’s support and was sworn in as PM on July 28, 1979.

Soon after assuming office, he addressed the nation and spelt out the challenges and priorities of his government. “I am speaking to you tonight as your first public servant … Poverty has to be eliminated and the basic necessities of life made available to every single citizen. Political leadership of the country must remember that nothing mocks our values and dreams more than the desperate struggles of our people for existence … Nothing could, therefore, be a more patriotic objective for our political leaders than to ensure that no child will go to bed hungry …”
He added, “Unemployment is on the increase. There cannot be a greater misery than those young men fully qualified and wanting gainful employment, find themselves idle.”
Singh could never prove his government’s majority on the floor of Parliament. Though the five-year term of the sixth Lok Sabha was to end in March 1981, President Neelam Sanjiva Reddy dissolved the House on August 22, 1979. Singh continued functioning as a caretaker PM till January 14, 1980. In all, he spent 170 days in office.Advertisement
In the 1980 elections, Singh contested on a Janata Party (Secular) ticket from Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh and was re-elected to Parliament. Though his party won 41 seats and ended up as the second-largest group in Parliament, the Indira Gandhi-led Congress won the election in a landslide.
Though Charan Singh was re-elected from Baghpat in the 1984 general elections held in the aftermath of Gandhi’s assassination — he defeated the Congress’s Mahesh Chand — his party, the Lok Dal, faced a crushing defeat. It won only three of the 171 seats it contested. The Rajiv Gandhi-led Congress swept to power by winning 404 seats.",politics
"‘Maun-Mohan’, Night Watchman to ‘shining example’: PM Modi on Manmohan Singh over the years","Amid proceedings in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi surprised several people in both the Treasury benches and the Opposition when he thanked outgoing Rajya Sabha MP Manmohan Singh, his predecessor, for “guiding the House” and the country. Calling Singh a “shining example” of what an MP should be, Modi said the former PM even came to the Upper House in “a wheelchair to help strengthen democracy”.
However, over the years, Modi and Singh have often taken on each other over issues of policy and political ideology, making highly critical remarks about each other.
Narendra Modi on Manmohan Singh
Modi consistently hit out at Singh in the lead-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections when he was pitching himself as a prime ministerial candidate.Advertisement
At a rally in October 2012, when he was the Gujarat CM, Modi called Singh“Maun (silent)” Mohan Singh. Referring to a speech the then PM made in Una, Modi said: “Aaaj ki sabse badhi khabar hai ki Maun Mohan Singh ne apana maun tod diya (Today’s biggest news is that ‘Maun-Mohan’ Singh broke his silence).”
Almost a year later, in March 2013, while speaking at the BJP National Council meeting in New Delhi, Modi called Singh a “night watchman”. He told his BJP colleagues, “They appointed a night watchman by naming Manmohan Singh as PM. The PM is nothing but a puppet of the Gandhi family.”
The following month, addressing BJP workers in Kolkata, Modi said Singh was not accepted as a leader in the Congress. “If you ask 100 Congress workers as to who their leader is, no one will name Manmohan Singhji, irrespective of him being the Prime Minister…How can such a prime minister lead a nation?” he asked.
Remarks of such nature continued over the years.
In February 2017, speaking in the Rajya Sabha, Modi took another dig at Singh. Expressing surprise at the “clean record of Dr Singh” even as his government faced various corruption allegations, PM Modi said: “Not a single corruption charge against Manmohan Singh that too during the most corrupt government. The art of taking a bath while wearing a raincoat in the bathroom can be learnt from Manmohan Singh.”Advertisement
The remark infuriated the Congress and led to Opposition walkouts.
In May 2019, Modi referred to Singh as “an acting PM imposed on the country” by the Congress. At a rally in Madhya Pradesh’s Sagar, Modi said, “Whether it is running a remote-control government or playing video games, these people (Congress) cannot think above acting. This is why they imposed an acting Prime Minister at the helm of the country and waited till the Prime Minister-in-making became wise.”
Launching the Chhattisgarh Assembly election campaign in Ambikapur on September 8 last year, Modi compared his predecessor to then Chhattisgarh CM Raman Singh. He hit out at the former PM, who is a renowned economist and was the architect of the 1991 liberalisation policy during his tenure as finance minister, for his decisions on the Indian economy.
“While the doctor of people (Raman Singh) was doing excellent (work) for their well-being, the doctor of rupee (Manmohan Singh) was not able to heal the wounds of the Indian currency at all. He said the rupee was battling for life in a hospital,” said the PM.
Manmohan Singh on Narendra ModiAdvertisement
On January 4, 2014, ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, Singh said at a press conference: “Without discussing the merits of Narendra Modi, I sincerely believe that it will be disastrous for the country to have Shri Narendra Modi as the Prime Minister.”
After four years, addressing another conference in Indore in November 2018 ahead of the Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections, Singh was asked about his 2014 comment.
“I did say Modi will be a disaster as the PM. Now I recognise I used a harsh word I should not have used. I don’t want to repeat it. But time is not far off when the public at large will have the chance to pronounce on the efficacy or otherwise of public policy which has been put in place by Modiji,” he said.
Singh has also been critical of his successor’s economic policies. In November 2016, during a debate on demonetisation, he said that the way “the scheme had been implemented was a monumental management failure”, and called it “a case of organised loot, legalised plunder of the common people”.Advertisement
A year later, in November 2017 Singh said at a gathering in Ahmedabad that demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) were a “twin blow to the economy”.
On December 10, 2017, Modi alleged that at a meeting held at former MP Mani Shankar Aiyar’s residence in which Singh and a former Army chief were present, the Congress colluded with Pakistan to interfere with the Gujarat polls.
In response, Singh said in a statement, “I am deeply pained and anguished by the falsehood and canards being spread to score political points in a lost cause by none less than Prime Minister … Fearing imminent defeat in Gujarat, the desperation of the Prime Minister to hurl every abuse and latch on to every straw is palpable. Sadly & regrettably, Sh Modi is setting a dangerous precedent by his insatiable desire to tarnish every constitutional office, including that of a Former Prime Minister and Army Chief.”
The former PM, in an interview to The Indian Express in April 2018, criticised Modi over his “silence” on the rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in Kathua and the alleged rape of a teenager by a BJP MLA in Unnao. Modi “should follow his own advice to me” and “speak more often”, he said.Advertisement
Asked about the BJP taunting him with the ‘Maun-Mohan Singh” comment, the former PM said he “had lived with comments like these his whole life”.
In May 2019, in an interview to PTI, Singh had called the NDA regime up till that point “a sad story of governance and accountability failure”. He had remarked that Modi’s rule was the most “traumatic” and “devastating for India’s youth, farmers, traders and every democratic institution”.
Singh also took on Modi over policy on Pakistan. “Modi’s slipshod policy on Pakistan was marred by a series of flip-flops — from going to Pakistan uninvited to inviting rogue ISI to Pathankot,” he said.",politics
"‘By fencing Myanmar border, govt will only create another Berlin Wall… For centuries, same people have inhabited both sides’: Manipur tribal forum leader","Ginza Vualzong, spokesperson for the Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum, has been at the forefront of articulating the anxieties, problems and demands of the Kuki-Zo community in Manipur, since the onset of violence in the state in May 2023. As a representative of an influential civil society organisation of tribal people in Manipur, Vualzong has been part of multiple rounds of talks between the Centre and Kuki-Zo delegations from the state. On Wednesday, under the aegis of Zo United, his delegation had a detailed discussion with the Centre’s pointsperson for the Northeast, A K Mishra. He spoke to The Indian Express on the situation in Manipur.
Excerpts:
The Union Home Minister has announced withdrawal of the Free Movement Regime (FMR) from the Indo-Myanmar border, and the fencing of all of Manipur’s border with Myanmar.
The Centre’s cancellation of FMR will hurt the sentiments of many people in Manipur, Nagaland and Mizoram. For centuries, the same people with the same tradition and culture have inhabited both sides of the boundary. We were only divided by an international boundary drawn by the British. The people and lands remain the same. Unfortunately, without our consent, our people have been split up into three countries — Bangladesh, India and Myanmar.Advertisement
By fencing the border, the government will only create another Berlin Wall. We request the government to reconsider its decision on FMR. Even the governments and NGOs of Mizoram and Nagaland are with us on this. Also, to abolish the FMR will be against the principles of the Look East and Act East policies of the Centre.
The violence in Manipur is refusing to ebb. Why?
If the government wanted to resolve the issue, it could have defused the crisis. When they know law and order has collapsed in Manipur, they could have introduced President’s Rule, but they let Biren (Chief Minister N Biren Singh) run the show. When 37 MLAs and two MPs submitted to the armed radical Meitei group Arambai Tenggol, there was no reaction from the Central government. No disqualification order was issued against them. None of the Arambai Tenggol members, who openly displayed arms and took over the government, was arrested.
On the other hand, Manipur state forces are involved in the atrocities on the Kuki-Zo people. So to sum up, the government is letting the conflict go on.
What issues did your delegation discuss in the meeting with A K Mishra on Wednesday. What are your demands? Wwere any assurances given by the MHA?Advertisement
The main topic was the capitulation of the state government before Arambai Tenggol. It was a gross violation of the Constitution. We can’t be under a government that submits itself to armed militia. That’s why we need to be separated from this government. We need a separate Union Territory administration with a Legislature.
MHA officials noted our grievances and said they will escalate them with ‘higher authorities’.
Has the MHA assured you of a separate administration?
On our political demand, the Centre has said it will take some time as it not only involves us but also the Nagas and the Meiteis. They asked us to give them some time and space.
What hope do you have of a resolution of the ongoing conflict?Advertisement
What we observe from the numerous talks we have had with the Centre is that the current government is not politically committed to finding a solution for us. But we haven’t lost faith in it and hope and pray that the government finds a befitting solution for us.
Moreh has seen a spurt in violence in recent weeks. The state government has alleged that Kuki militants have attacked security forces.
We have made many requests to the Central government to remove Meitei commandos from Moreh. Their presence only incites violence. The Meitei state forces or commandos are supposed to protect citizens, but they were involved in burning of Kuki-Zo civilian houses, schools and loot of properties. As there are Central forces in Moreh, there is no need for Meitei state forces.
Moreh is a key border town and business hub. It is strategically and commercially important for the state and the country. Because of the exchange of population due to the violence, Kuki-Zo tribals remained in the area, while the Meiteis fled. In all other parts of the state, tribal policemen are stationed in tribal-majority areas, and vice-versa. But in Moreh, the CM deployed Meitei commandos to patrol the area, knowing fully that tensions would arise.Advertisement
CM Biren Singh has said he is setting up a panel to reconsider the ST status of Kukis.
One of the factors behind the current conflict was the demand of ST status for Meiteis. If Biren is going to delist Kukis of their ST status, it will only further aggravate the situation.
What is the current situation in the Kuki-dominated hills?
Today (Thursday), we got a report that Meitei militants attacked a Kuki-Zo area. So the situation is far from normal. Power lines to Churachandpur and Pherzawl were damaged by Meitei miscreants. It’s been seven days now that our districts are in complete darkness. The repair persons were not allowed to work. Now, with the intervention of Central forces, some repairs have been carried out.
Because of the ethnic conflict, tribal students are now at the mercy of Meitei officials. The state education board, medical directorate and head offices of all technical institutes are based in Imphal, and are controlled by Meitei individuals. For any office-related work, tribals can no longer go to Imphal. The careers of thousands of students now depend on the whims of officials in Imphal.Advertisement
Kuki-Zo tribals no longer have access to the Manipur High Court, as they can’t travel to Imphal. No remote facilities are available to tribal lawyers to be in touch with the High Court. For instance, all bail petitions have to be moved through the court, but Kuki-Zo lawyers are unable to take up cases as they cannot travel to the capital",politics
"Threats of ‘poaching’, Speaker yet to resign: Bihar political intrigues continue ahead of trust vote","With days to go for the Bihar trust vote on February 12, the NDA government led by Nitish Kumar and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are engaged in mind games. Speaker Awadh Bihari Choudhary has yet to step down from his position, with the RJD saying that the Nitish government is “precariously placed” and hinting at more changes in political equations in the state. The BJP, meanwhile, has warned of “stern action” if horse-trading is attempted.
An RJD leader told The Indian Express, “It is always safe to have our Speaker in a situation when the Nitish government is precariously placed. The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), which has been supporting the government, looks non-committal. Some JD(U) MLAs also look upset with Nitish changing sides.”

The Mahagathbandhan has 114 MLAs in the 243-member Assembly, eight short of a simple majority. Even if Jitan Ram Manjhi’s Hindustani Awam Morcha backs it, the Opposition alliance will be four short of the majority mark. The NDA has the support of 128 MLAs, including Manjhi’s party and one Independent MLA.Advertisement
The other scenario in which the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government can fall is if legislators in the ruling alliance break ranks. Deputy CM Samrat Choudhary of the BJP on Thursday said, “The NDA government will comfortably win the trust vote. It is the Opposition that needs to worry about keeping its flock together.”
On Tuesday, Samrat Choudhary had warned the RJD of any “stern action”, saying, “Lalu Prasad should know I am well aware of his party’s vulnerability to a split, though the BJP does not believe in such tactics.”
About the Speaker, he said, “It is only a matter of time before the Speaker, against whom all NDA MLAs have moved a no-confidence motion, is replaced. Either he will resign or face the ignominy of being voted out in the House where a majority of members do not have faith in him.”
Deputy Assembly Speaker and senior JD (U) leader Maheshwar Hazari on Thursday said, “The Speaker should have resigned on moral grounds as he is facing a no-confidence motion. He should let the House choose its new Speaker.”Advertisement

But defending his decision, the Speaker, who is said to be sticking around as directed by his party bosses, said, “As I am facing a no-confidence motion, I am under a 14-day notice period and am very much the Speaker till the period is over. There is no question of my resigning. I am going only by set procedures.”
BJP leader Vijay Kumar Sinha, now a Deputy CM along with Samrat Choudhary, was the Speaker when Nitish ditched the NDA in August 2022 and joined the Mahagathbandhan. Facing a no-confidence motion, he too resigned before voting on a trust motion. Sources close to Awadh Bihari Choudhary said he too might do the same.
Who is Awadh Bihari Choudhary?
The 76-year-old is a six-time MLA from Siwan. His political career got off to a flying start after he won as a Janta Party candidate in the 1985 Assembly polls. Choudhary retained his seat as Janata Dal candidate in the 1990 and 1995 Assembly polls and as an RJD candidate in 2000 and the February 2005 polls.
But he lost the elections to the NDA’s Vyasdeo Prasad in the state elections held in October 2005. Prasad retained Siwan in the next two Assembly polls. Choudhary joined the JD(U) after the 2010 Assembly polls but could not carve out a space for himself. After the 2015 Assembly polls, he returned to the RJD. Choudhary was seen as the RJD’s Yadav face in Siwan, more so during the years when former Siwan MP Mohammed Shahabuddin dominated politics in the region.",politics
"Today in Politics: Will BJP pick a side in Andhra Pradesh? As Jagan arrives in Delhi, speculation swirls","A day after Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president N Chandrababu Naidu met Union Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP chief J P Nadda in Delhi, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy arrived in the national Capital on Thursday night. This has sparked buzz that the southern state with 25 Lok Sabha seats is set to undergo a political reconfiguration.
Jagan is likely to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other senior BJP leaders on Friday. This comes days after the Andhra CM said he hopes no party returns to power at the Centre with an absolute majority as that will leave the state with no leverage. The signals emanating from Jagan’s meetings in Delhi will be closely tracked, with the Andhra CM’s Delhi sojourn likely to be among the top political stories of the day.

In context: The visit is being officially viewed as one where Jagan will discuss special category status for Andhra Pradesh, one of the long-pending demands of the state and something over which Naidu broke ties with the BJP in 2019. As Sreenivas Janyala explains, during his 2017 statewide yatra the YSRCP leader constantly targeted the TDP over its inability to get the Centre to concede the special status. This ultimately forced Naidu’s hands and he quit the NDA. It also created the momentum that propelled Jagan to power in 2019.Advertisement
But now the Andhra CM finds himself in the same boat that his chief rival and predecessor found himself in five years ago. The TDP wants the BJP to join hands with it and Pawan Kalyan’s Jana Sena Party to take on Jagan. Earlier, Sreenivas and Liz Mathew reported that while some leaders in BJP and TDP remain opposed to a tie-up, the top leadership of both parties is keen on an alliance.

For the BJP, expanding its footprint in the South, where it has lost two big states in two years, remains the larger goal. With the YSRCP not showing any signs of coming on board the NDA, one calculation in the party is that it can win a few Lok Sabha seats in Andhra on its own as part of the tripartite alliance. Since last year, the BJP has been weighing its options as Jagan, with whom its central leadership has cordial ties, is seen as the pre-eminent political force in the state. But in recent months there have been a few signs of anti-incumbency that have forced the Andhra CM to effect an organisational restructure. This has led to a few MPs quitting the YSRCP in protest. All this will likely shape the BJP’s final assessment.
What is the INDIA bloc’s future?
For the past few days, there has also been speculation about a major shift in Uttar Pradesh politics. The Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) led by Jayant Chaudhary is reported to be in talks with the BJP. There is a possibility of it ditching the Samajwadi Party (SP), its ally since 2019, and the INDIA alliance to join the NDA. Here is Asad Rehman with all the details.

There is just a matter of a few seats that remain to be sorted out, Asad reports. A deal, an RLD leader tells him, may be reached in a “day or two”. That means we may be looking at the second major exit from the INDIA alliance after Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) as early as Friday or over the weekend. That will raise questions about the future of the Opposition bloc that seems beleaguered, unable to close seat-sharing deals in states such as UP and Maharashtra. It also seems increasingly unlikely for the alliance’s constituents to reach an agreement in states such as Punjab and West Bengal.Advertisement
Congress in BJP’s sights
While the Opposition totters along, the BJP is setting up its poll chessboard ahead of the big battle. The party has stepped up voter outreach and its National Council is likely to meet days after the PM returns from the UAE, which he is scheduled to visit from February 13-14.

The BJP, focussing its attacks only on the Congress, is also set to begin a nationwide campaign using the contents of the White Paper in which the Modi government has detailed how the Congress-led UPA allegedly mismanaged the economy. The government has scheduled a discussion on the document in the Lok Sabha on Friday. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to reply to the debate for which four hours have been allocated. The Rajya Sabha will take up the discussion after clearing the legislative business listed for the day.

"White Paper in hand, BJP lays out its gameplan: Nationwide campaign against Congress, economy to be major poll plank","The White Paper on the Indian economy, which slammed the Congress-led UPA government for “its policy misadventures” and explained how the Narendra Modi government has “straightened” it, will be one of the major poll planks of the ruling BJP with its state units being directed to launch a nationwide campaign around it.
To build the narrative around the 59-page document, tabled in Parliament on Thursday, the government has also scheduled a discussion in the Lok Sabha on Friday and the Rajya Sabha on Saturday.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to reply to the debate for which four hours have been allocated in the Lok Sabha on Friday. The Rajya Sabha will take up the discussion on the White Paper after clearing the legislative business listed for Friday.Advertisement
Sources said BJP state units across the country will highlight the details of the “White Paper of the Economy” – the first time in Independent India – underscoring “what went wrong in the economy during the 10 years of UPA and the efforts taken by the Modi government to put it back on track”.
Political Pulse | White Paper in Parliament, why BJP is keeping guns trained on Cong: ‘Regional allies not permanent foes’
Sources in the BJP said the discourse on the White Paper would certainly reinforce the message of the “strong and able leadership” of Modi and the “good governance record of his government that takes the country to be a major economic force in the world.”
A senior BJP leader said: “Every BJP state unit will take this up. The leaders will describe how difficult it was for our government to overcome the crisis created by the UPA government’s mismanagement of economics. Despite the poor state of affairs and the hardships, the Centre had not reduced any tax share for the states. We kept the government on the reform path which led to an increase in revenue.”
The leader said the White Paper would give a reply to the charges of the non-NDA state governments about inadequate tax devolution.Advertisement
The BJP would also campaign the “differences between the Commonwealth Games in 2010 and the G20 summit in 2023” held under the UPA and the BJP government.
“While one led to the country losing its face, the other enhanced its prestige. While the CWG was centred in the national capital where works were done shabbily and involved corruption, the Prime Minister ensured that every state was involved (for the G20), which gave local economies a fillip,” said a BJP leader.
The Congress government in Karnataka and the Left Democratic Front government in Kerala protested in New Delhi against the alleged “financial atrocities” carried out against non-BJP-ruled states.

Sources in the government said Prime Minister Modi “felt bad and outrageous” at the state of the economy when he took charge in 2014.Advertisement
“But he took a conscious call not to come out with a White Paper then because the government did not want investors as well as people to lose confidence in the Indian economy. Now, that the government has worked for 10 years systematically to correct the wrongs and improve the situation, it’s time to tell the people,” said the leader, adding, “He (Modi) personally took initiative in correcting the mistakes. For every sector, corrective measures were taken and he personally followed it up.”
“Economic crisis, fiscal management crisis, industrial policy crisis, banking crisis – all were outcomes of the mismanagement – and they pushed the country to the fragile-five-economy status,” said the leader.
The White Paper tore into the Congress-led UPA rule, stating that it had turned the Indian economy into a non-performing one through indiscriminate revenue expenditure, off-budget borrowings and piles of bad debts at banks.
Political Pulse | Decode Politics: Modi govt’s last move for this House is a white paper on ‘economy under it vs UPA’. So what are white papers?
For example, said a source in the government, the UPA government had announced the loan-waiver scheme, but the changes required in the banking laws to ensure that the farmers who got the one-timer waiver would have no difficulty in availing loans in future were not made.Advertisement
The White Paper also said: “The special bonds in lieu of cash subsidy issued to the oil marketing companies, fertiliser companies and Food Corporation of India by the UPA government totalled a little over Rs 1.9 lakh crore in five years from FY06 to FY10. Their inclusion in the subsidy bill for each year would have swelled the fiscal deficits and revenue deficits.”",politics
RLD deal ‘almost finalised’: What BJP has offered as Jayant Chaudhary inches closer to quitting INDIA bloc,"With consensus yet to be reached with the Samajwadi Party (SP) on details of seat-sharing in Uttar Pradesh, the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) is moving closer to joining the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the coming days, sources within the party told The Indian Express on Thursday. The BJP, party insiders said, was offering it four Lok Sabha constituencies, a Union ministry, and two state ministries.
If the RLD jumps ship, it will be a major blow to the Opposition INDIA alliance in UP at a time when the Congress and the Samajwadi Party (SP) are also attempting to resolve differences over seat-sharing. A senior RLD leader said, “Things have been almost finalised between us and the BJP. The formal announcement may happen soon, perhaps in a day or two.”

An RLD leader also provided details of the seat-sharing arrangement. “The BJP is giving us four seats for the Lok Sabha polls, one Union ministry, and two state ministers in UP. There are some issues on some seats but they will be worked out. One of the seats they are refusing to give us is Muzaffarnagar. That, too, will be worked out,” the leader said. Union Minister Sanjeev Balyan has been representing Muzaffarnagar in the Lok Sabha since 2014.Advertisement
Sources in the BJP also confirmed progress in the talks between the two parties. A senior BJP leader in Delhi said, “Our party is offering them Baghpat, Mathura, Hathras, and Amroha. The party leadership has refused to give them Muzaffarnagar and Kairana. We are even offering Bijnor and Saharanpur.”
If the RLD quits the INDIA alliance, it will further weaken the beleaguered alliance in UP. Last month, SP president Akhilesh Yadav announced that the RLD would be allotted seven constituencies as part of a seat-sharing arrangement but the lack of clarity about which constituencies the party would get had created a sense of uncertainty in party ranks.

SP insiders had earlier said that the RLD would get Baghpat, Kairana, Mathura, Hathras, and Fatehpur Sikri while discussions were on for Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Bijnor, and Amroha. RLD leaders said there had been issues over the SP wanting its leaders to contest some of these seven seats on their symbol. Among these seats was Kairana, where the SP wanted to field Iqra Hasan, the sister of SP MLA Nahid Hasan.
Akhilesh on Thursday, while speaking to reporters in Varanasi, did not provide a clear answer on the future of the SP-RLD partnership. “The BJP knows how to break parties and when to take whom. The BJP also knows how to cheat. You have seen how cheating happened in the recent Chandigarh mayoral elections. The BJP knows how to buy parties. It is not by coincidence that the BJP has become the biggest party. They know where to send ED, CBI, and the IT department,” he said.Advertisement
For the last couple of days, there have been reports of RLD leaders meeting the BJP leadership. Amid this, RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary, who was elected Rajya Sabha MP from Uttar Pradesh in 2022 with the SP’s support, maintained silence.

On Wednesday, Akhilesh appeared to dissuade the RLD from joining the NDA. “Jayant Chaudhary is an educated person and he understands politics well. I am hopeful that he will not let the fight for farmers and prosperity of UP be weakened,” he told reporters in Lucknow. SP MP Dimple Yadav, Akhilesh’s wife, who is in Delhi to participate in the Parliament session said Wednesday she does not believe that Chaudhary would join hands with the BJP, which has “an anti-farmer record”. “I don’t think he will take any decision that would hurt the interests of farmers,” she said.
The RLD and the SP have been allies in UP since the 2019 Lok Sabha polls when the Jayant-led party contested three constituencies as part of a “Mahagathbandhan” that also included the Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). The RLD lost all three seats while the SP won five of the 37 it contested. In the 2022 Assembly polls, the SP won 111 seats out of the 347 it contested while the RLD won nine of the 33 constituencies where it was in the fray.",politics
"‘Tired of waiting’ for seat-sharing with allies, AAP announces 3 candidates for Lok Sabha polls in Assam","Saying it is “tired of talking” about seat-sharing with alliance partners, the Aam Aadmi Party’s central leadership on Thursday announced candidates for three out of Assam’s 14 Lok Sabha seats. At the same time, the party insisted that it is “strongly” with the Opposition INDIA bloc.
AAP has not yet announced any candidates from either Delhi or Punjab, states where the party is in power.
The party, which has previously not contested any parliamentary or Assembly elections in Assam, is part of the INDIA bloc nationally and is also one of 15 parties in the United Opposition Forum alliance in Assam.Advertisement
The United Opposition Forum had been stitched together even before the INDIA bloc was launched, and it had announced that it would field consensus candidates to all 14 Lok Sabha seats in the state. None of the other parties in the alliance – Congress, TMC, RJD, CPI(M), CPI, and regional parties like Akhil Gogoi’s Raijor Dal and Lurinjyoti Gogoi’s Assam Jatiya Parishad – have announced candidates in the state.
Of the 14 current MPs from Assam, nine are from the BJP, three are from Congress, one is from the All India United Democratic Front, and one is an Independent.
On Thursday, AAP’s national general secretary (organisation) Sandeep Pathak made an official announcement declaring its state president Bhaben Choudhury as its Guwahati candidate, state vice-president Manoj Dhanowar as its Dibrugarh candidate, and state organising secretary Rishiraj Kaundinya as Sonitpur candidate. Having claimed these three seats through its announcement, the party sought to appear to leave the ball in its alliance partners’ court, saying that it hoped the INDIA alliance would give these seats to AAP.
“We have quite little time left for Lok Sabha elections… That’s why AAP is announcing three candidates from Assam for the Lok Sabha elections… We will start our work and preparations in full strength from these three seats now and I have full faith that the INDIA alliance will give these three seats to AAP,” Pathak said.Advertisement
Suggesting that the seat-sharing talks within the alliance have stretched on for too long, he said a greater sense of urgency is called for as the elections draw closer.
“There have been conversations with the INDIA alliance for many days now. It has been months of talking. Now we are tired of talking. We have to fight elections, win elections… It is very clear that when you come to a gathbandhan (alliance), and you want to win an election, if your target is to win, time and strategy become very important. We are getting tired of talking… We are strongly with the alliance, but the first duty is winning elections. Everything should be expedited. The more it is expedited, the better are the chances to win,” he said.
Back in Assam, the party’s vice-president said AAP is willing to support any candidate put up by the alliance in any of the other 11 seats from the state. “It is not like we are going against the INDIA alliance. We are choosing to contest in just three seats… We will support the other parties’ candidates in all the other 11 seats,” he said.
In the meantime, Assam Congress president Bhupen Bora, who has led the effort to bring together the United Opposition Forum in the state, said he continued to hope that all the seats in Assam are contested through an understanding between the alliance partners in the state.Advertisement
“In the Opposition alliance that we started in Assam, there was a resolution to fight against the BJP in Lok Sabha and next Assembly elections together… As national parties, we are dependent on our national leadership. Our conversations have been going on with Bhaben Choudhury, but the national leadership (of AAP) has announced three candidates for Assam from their side – that is their party’s decision. I can’t say much about it, but within Assam’s boundaries, until the final moment of nomination withdrawal, we will try to contest the election with an understanding. So, I will not abandon hope,” he said.",politics
Decode Politics: Rahul Gandhi says Modi ‘not born OBC’; BJP claims Telis notified thus under Cong Gujarat govt,"Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Thursday found himself in another row during his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra’s Odisha leg by claiming Prime Minister Narendra Modi was “not born an OBC“, prompting a sharp retort from the Centre.
“He was born a Teli, which was in the general category, and it was the BJP which included them in the OBC category in 2000,” the Wayanad MP said, later revising it to say Modi was a “Modh Ghanchi” in Chhattisgarh.
“Modi ji was not born OBC. Modi is from Modh Ghachi caste in Gujarat and the state government gave it OBC status in 2000. Your Prime Minister (Modi) was not of OBC caste. He was from general caste. For 24 hours, he says he is OBC but Modiji you are not OBC, you are from general caste,” Rahul said.Advertisement
Accusing Modi of “fooling the people”, he said this was why his government was not in favour of a nationwide caste census as it was essentially meant to determine the real proportion of different castes and groups.
Who are the Telis in Gujarat?
According to the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC), members of the Teli community in Gujarat are oil millers by occupation and are involved in the traditional craft of “tel ghani (oil extraction)”.
On July 25, 1994, Gujarat government led by Congress’s Chief Minister Chhabildas Mehta had issued a resolution while adding the Ghanchi community among the list of Socially and Economically Backward Classes (SEBCs).
Another resolution of the Gujarat government – dated June 20, 1995 and seen by The Indian Express, places the Teli and Modh Ghanchi communities at number 25A in the list while the Ghanchi (Muslims) are placed at number 25.Advertisement
“From now on , as per the SEBC list, caste certificates should be issued as per entry 25 – Ghanchi (Muslim) or as per entry 25A – Teli and Modh Ghanchi (Hindu),” the 1995 government resolution states.

Do Modh Ghanchis find a place in the Central OBC list?
A public hearing of the Gujarat Bench of the NCBC was held in Ahmedabad in August 1997 to include Telis as well as 16 other sub-castes, including the Modh Ghanchis in the Central list of OBCs.
The Teli community, represented by general secretary of the Gujarat State Tailik Sahu Mahasabha, N S Chaudhari, submitted that the Telis and Modh Ghanchis were not included in the Central list on the basis of the “principle of commonality”, as they found a place in the Mandal list, but the Ghanchi (Muslims) featured in both.
“Those present at the public hearing not only did not object to the inclusion of Teli and Modh Ghanchi as synonyms of Ghanchi (Muslim) in the Central list of OBCs but also supported it,” the NCBC noted and recommended the inclusion of the Teli community in the list with retrospective effect from the date when the reservation for backward classes came into effect – September 8, 1993.Advertisement
Following the recommendations of the NCBC, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment amended the Central list and added the Telis and Modh Ghanchis to it in October 1999, around the time the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government led by the BJP came to power. The following year, the list was further amended to include the Teli Sahus, Teli Rathods and Teli Rathores.

Currently, the Central list of OBCs features 104 communities from Gujarat.
What has been BJP’s response to Rahul’s claims?
The Central government issued a short note titled “facts regarding Rahul Gandhi’s statement on PM’s caste”, in which it said the Modh Ghanchi caste was included in Gujarat’s list of socially and economically backward classes and OBCs. The note added that the notification to include the sub-group in the list of OBCs was issued on July 25, 1994 — when the state was helmed by the Congress.
“The same sub-group was included (in) OBC (list) as per a Government of India notification dated April 4, 2000. When both notifications were released, Shri Narendra Modi was not in power, and was not holding an executive office at the time,” the Centre’s response said.Advertisement
Modi assumed charge as the CM of Gujarat in 2001, a post which he held till 2014 when he became the Prime Minister.
On Thursday evening, demanding an apology from Rahul, BJP leader Narhari Amin posted on X: “I was serving as the Deputy Chief Minister of Gujarat in the Congress Government when GoG (Government of Gujarat) notified Modh-Ghanchi as OBC on 25th July 1994. This is the same caste our respected Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi belongs to. Mr. @RahulGandhi is insulting the OBC communities by cooking up mindless lies on this issue. This decision, and the subsequent GoI notification came when Shri @narendramodi was not even MP/MLA, forget being CM.”",politics
‘We can’t let Indian democracy which was envisaged as a ‘Union of States’ be crippled into a ‘Union over States’: Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan,"In Delhi with his entire Cabinet and LDF MLAs and MPs to protest against the Centre over its fiscal policy towards states, Kerala Chief Minister and CPI(M) Politburo member talks about why his government was forced to take this step and why he sees no contradictions in the Left’s alliance with the Congress in INDIA. Excerpts from an email interview:
* The Left has always been on the warpath against the Union government and BJP. But this time the state’s entire ruling apparatus led by you was in Delhi to protest. You have also moved the Supreme Court against ‘discrimination’ by the Centre.
We are not on any warpath, we have cooperated effectively on various developmental projects and welfare schemes. At the same time, we have some serious concerns about the discrimination and injustice being meted out to Kerala, especially with regard to our finances.Advertisement
It is not just Kerala, all Opposition-ruled states are facing such trouble. Ours is probably the severest. We have raised them (the issues) through various means, but they have fallen on deaf ears. That is why we had to approach the Supreme Court and why the state’s entire Cabinet, along with MPs and MLAs, had to protest in Delhi. That’s a first in the history of the Indian Republic…
We are discriminated against during disasters, in budgets, in transfer of funds, in the administration of projects and schemes, with regard to railway development… in calculating public debt and so on.
* There is a criticism that your protest was political and the real intention was to divert the attention of the people from the mishandling of the state economy by your government?
If that was the case, why did the government of Karnataka also protest? Why is it that several states have approached the Supreme Court on issues related to their finances and administration?Advertisement
We have come out in protest after trying everything else. We wrote to the Union… the FM was briefed in person. The PM was notified officially. Despite trying for more than a year… the Union has not responded favourably.
… Despite the Union strangling us, we have achieved remarkable growth. Kerala’s total expenditure has risen from Rs 1,31,884 crore in 2020-21 to Rs 1,58,738 crore in 2022-23. By the end of this year, it is poised to rise to Rs 1,68,407 crore. Our own revenue has grown from Rs 58,341 crore in 2021-22 to Rs 71,968 crore in 2022-23 and, by this year end, it will increase to Rs 78,000 crore. Does this look like mishandling?

* Though the LDF and UDF are both part of the INDIA alliance at the national level, the Congress did not participate in your government’s protest.
The state leadership of the Congress should answer this question, as to why they are not standing with the people of Kerala on such an important issue… In a similar situation in the past… when the UDF was in office, the Leader of the Opposition from the LDF… accompanied the then Chief Minister to meet the Prime Minister (of the BJP)… to demand that the state get what is rightfully ours…Advertisement
However, the present Opposition in Kerala is not interested in standing for the state… They are whitewashing the policies of the Union (government). Maybe because they too have a history of eating into states’ constitutional rights and financial shares.
* Do you think the people will accept your proposition of fighting the Congress in Kerala and aligning with them elsewhere, especially in West Bengal?
During UPA I, we had provided outside support to the government on the basis of a Common Minimum Programme. We have always stood for the interest of the country. In the all-India scenario, the Sangh Parivar and its political wing BJP are furthering their communal agenda without addressing the issues of people’s lives and livelihoods. They are anti-Constitution, in the sense that they are trying to weaken all its values, especially secularism and federalism, and thereby ultimately our democracy. So, they have to be defeated. Accordingly democratic and secular parties have to come together… The people are well aware of this situation.
* Federalism is one common concern of Opposition parties. Given your long administrative experience, how do you view the Centre-state relations under Narendra Modi?Advertisement
Those who wax eloquent about cooperative federalism (the BJP) have tried to undercut the devolution of funds to states by influencing the Finance Commission (FC). The Terms of Reference of FCs are determined by the Union government. States’ opinions and suggestions are not taken into account.
At the same time, we are seeing the Union government amassing funds by hiking cess and surcharge which are not shared with the states as they do not fall in the divisible pool. Yet, the Union government’s allocation for its own schemes is coming down year after year, with states forced to shell out more from their cash-strapped pockets. Even in the interim budget that was presented a few days back, the states were further squeezed as loans given for capital expenditure were reduced.
The Union government has made laws that encroach upon states’ powers and duties in several sectors, even on law and order, which falls in the States’ List… Multinational agreements are being entered into, on issues that affect states, without seeking their opinion.
During Congress governments too, states’ rights were trampled upon. However, today, it has reached unprecedented proportions. Essentially we should have a strong Union and empowered states. Kerala is doing its fair share in making the Union strong by contributing massively by way of bringing in much-needed foreign exchange… The NRKs (Non-Resident Keralites) too fetch foreign exchange. Despite our contributions… we are being discriminated against.Advertisement
* BJP leaders always speak about the rampant use of Article 356, including against the first Left government in Kerala, led by E M S Namboodiripad. Compared to that, do you see the Modi regime as more considerate?
Subsequent to the Supreme Court’s verdict in the S R Bommai vs Union of India, it is not that easy to invoke Article 356. However, the current ruling dispensation does not have to use Article 356. They are able to topple elected state governments through horse-trading… Is altering the people’s verdict by hook or crook the definition of being considerate?
They abrogated Article 370. They make governors dance to their tune in Opposition-ruled states. Today, governors are even questioning the autonomy of the Legislature by indefinitely delaying assent to Bills.
* However, some of your rivals allege an understanding between you and the Centre, as it is not coming down on your government and leaders, unlike in other states?Advertisement
We are one of the most vocal state governments against the Union government’s discrimination, injustice and communal politics. Would (this) be possible if there was any understanding with them? They are using central agencies to destabilise our developmental and welfare initiatives… Our leaders are being hounded as well. Still, they are not able to get anything on us.

* Your daughter is facing serious charges, and the Union government’s agencies have started looking into them. The PM himself accused your office of corruption.
All through, there have been a slew of allegations against leaders of the Left. Not a single one has come true, because we in the Left are incorruptible… The PM has all the central agencies at his beck and call. Despite the veiled insinuations, his agencies are not able to find anything concrete.
* Many see 2024 as a foregone conclusion given the Opposition’s failure to match the BJP in coherence and direction.Advertisement
The issues of people’s lives and livelihoods are still to be addressed. As long as that is the case, we will continue the fight and the people will rally behind (us). I already mentioned the threat the BJP is causing to our country and its constitutional values… Even in the elections in which the BJP has come to power, the majority of the votes have been against the BJP. The important issue is to consolidate them.
* How do you see the Left nationally, given the way it is shrinking? Besides, unlike your predecessors, you remain focused on state politics. Should the Left project you as a national choice?
Even though our representation in Parliament has dwindled, the Left is active on the streets. On the CAA, farm laws and so on, we have been in the lead… The issues are not personal, they are political; so the solutions will also have to be political. It is not a matter of promoting any particular person.
* Earlier, the Kerala CPI(M) was seen as opposed to relations with the Congress, compared to its Bengal leaders. Have you reached a stage where it is no longer a contentious issue?Advertisement
Such an allegation is baseless. The party has a clear stand on this, it is based on a unanimous decision. As I already mentioned, the real objective is to defeat the Sangh Parivar and BJP.
* The BJP, led by PM Modi himself, is trying to breach the Kerala fort. They feel that the Ayodhya Ram Temple consecration as well as a rethink towards it by the Christian masses will help it reach its goal.
They are yet to fully understand the people and society of Kerala and our unwavering commitment to secularism. The people are well aware of their ultimate game plan. That is why they defeated the lone MLA that the BJP was able to elect in previous elections.
* How do you see your government’s relations with Governor Arif Mohammed Khan? Have they reached a point of no return?
The issue is not isolated to Kerala. It is a larger issue that affects the whole country, especially its federal character. We cannot allow the Indian democracy which was envisaged as a ‘Union of States’ to be crippled into an undemocratic ‘Union over States’.",politics
"White Paper in Parliament, why BJP is keeping guns trained on Cong: ‘Regional allies not permanent foes’","From attacking the INDIA bloc as “ghamandia (arrogant)” and calling it “INDI” alliance, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has trained his guns exclusively on the Congress in his recent speeches in Parliament. And on Thursday, the BJP government released a “White Paper” that was yet another scathing criticism of the Congress-led UPA government’s handling of the economy during its tenure from 2004 to 2014.
In scathing criticism of the UPA government’s management of the economy, the document said the UPA government failed miserably to facilitate economic activities. “Instead the UPA Government created hurdles that held back the economy. It basked in the afterglory of the lagged effects of the reforms of the Vajpayee-led NDA government and benign global conditions and proceeded to exploit the resultant fast economic growth for narrow political purposes without much concern for long-term economic consequences. The result was a mountain of bad loans, a high fiscal deficit despite much of it being hidden, a high current account deficit, double-digit inflation for five years which hit the pockets of many Indians and membership of the club of “Fragile Five” in 2013,” it said.
Decode Politics | Modi govt’s last move for this House is a white paper on ‘economy under it vs UPA’. So what are white papers?
The document went on to say, “They (UPA) not only failed to impart dynamism into the economy but also robbed the economy of it such that our industrialists went on record stating that they would rather invest abroad than in India. To drive investors away is easy but to win them back is hard. The UPA government also demonstrated that it is easier to hurt the economy than it is to help it. They inherited a healthy economy and bequeathed an enfeebled one to us. We have restored its vitality.”Advertisement
While the document focused on the economy, Modi in his speeches in the two Houses of Parliament attacked the Congress on all possible grounds — as “anti-Dalit, anti-Adivasi and anti-OBC”, as being influenced by colonial thinking, and as being a vehicle of “misgovernance” for decades after independence — and started the attacks right from the time of Jawaharlal Nehru to the present leadership of Rahul Gandhi.
Explaining the PM’s “attack only Congress” policy, a BJP insider told The Indian Express, “If you notice, the party was attacking the Opposition as ghamandia and as INDI, rather than what it was calling itself, till months ago, as there was some possibility of the Opposition parties rallying together to take on the BJP. But with the exit of Nitish Kumar from the INDI alliance, and with Mamata Banerjee and AAP deciding to go it alone in Bengal and Punjab, respectively, the INDI alliance is basically just the Congress now, which explains why the attack should be focused on it.”

A BJP leader said that “one should choose one’s friends and foes wisely”, adding that with the exit of Nitish, and with multiple news reports saying the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) may cross over to the BJP-led NDA, the regional parties were not necessarily the BJP’s chief rivals in the coming elections. “Some may become our overt allies and some others, in badmouthing the Congress and spoiling its chances, will inadvertently act like covert allies. Why should we attack them?” asked the party functionary.
A BJP insider added another perspective. If regional parties in states where the BJP has a significant presence are routinely passing statements or acting in ways that embarrass the Congress, it suits the BJP to project the election as a national contest between the BJP and a beleaguered Congress.Advertisement
“If Modi ji starts attacking Mamata Banerjee from Delhi, will it not raise her stock in Bengal? So, when she is attacking Rahul Gandhi, why not focus on the Congress so that voters there feel that this is a national election and that the BJP is going to win the Lok Sabha with a huge margin against a directionless Congress? When no regional party without a serious tie-up with Congress can damage the BJP at the all-India level, it makes sense to now focus our attacks on the Congress rather than disperse them. However, our regional leaders will keep attacking these parties, as is a common practice in state politics,” said the leader.
Congress leaders also believe that the Prime Minister wants to project their party as his main challenger although the ruling party is up against regional parties in some states. One leader said Modi seems keen to reinforce the Congress-BJP and UPA-NDA binaries. “It is clear that he wants to frame the election as a contest between the Congress and the BJP … he has defeated us twice in parliamentary elections and several state polls since 2014. He may also want to project the election as a BJP and the Congress to edge out regional parties … ,” said a Congress leader.",politics
"Why Baba Siddique exit deals a blow to  Mumbai Congress, boosts Ajit Pawar NCP","In a setback to the Mumbai Congress ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, its high-profile face from the upscale Bandra belt, Baba Siddique, resigned from the party on Thursday.
The former minister and three-time MLA, Siddique, 66, is likely to join the NCP faction led by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar.
Must Read  | Sharad Pawar back to drawing board after losing NCP to Ajit, braces for toughest battle at 83
Announcing his resignation on X, Siddique said: “I joined the Indian National Congress party as a young teenager and it has been a significant journey lasting 48 years. Today I resign from the primary membership of the Indian National Congress Party with immediate effect. There’s a lot I would have liked to express but as they say some things are better left unsaid. I thank everyone who has been a part of this journey.”Advertisement
There had been speculation about Siddique’s move for some time. His son Zeeshan Siddique is currently the Congress MLA from Bandra East as well as the chief of the Youth Congress’s Mumbai unit. He is yet to announce his decision, although he may also follow his father’s footsteps.
Siddique’s rise
Siddique started his political innings with the Congress from the ranks and soon became one of close aides of former party veteran and actor late Sunil Dutt. Siddique established close ties with the Dutt family, particularly with his son Sanjay Dutt. He is still close to them, including ex-MP Priya Dutt.
Siddique was elected as a corporator of the Mumbai civic body on the Congress’s ticket for two terms, in 1992 and 1997. In 1999, he won from the Bandra West Assembly constituency as the Congress candidate, going on to retain the seat in the 2004 and 2009 polls.

Siddiqui had been the chairman of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA)’s Mumbai Board during 2000-2004. He also served as the minister of state for food and civil supplies in the then Congress-NCP government from 2004 to 2008.Advertisement
He, however, lost his seat to the BJP’s candidate in the 2014 polls. And, in the 2019 polls, the party fielded his son Zeeshan from the Bandra East constituency.
Siddique’s Bollywood connect
Siddique is also known for his influence in the Bollywood, with his annual iftar parties attended by leading film stars ranging from Shahrukh Khan and Salman Khan to Sanjay Dutt.
Siddique was however often criticised by his political opponents for allegedly giving free hand to criminals in his constituency. In 2017, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) raided the premises linked to him in Bandra in connection with a money laundering case over a land deal related to a slum rehabilitation project. He has since taken a back seat in public life, projecting Zeeshan as his political heir.
Congress sources claimed that Siddique, who hails from Bihar, had reached out to RJD leader Tejaswi Yadav for a Rajya Sabha seat in the past, but to no avail.Advertisement
Given his support base being confined to Bandra, the Congress refrained from projecting Siddique as its Muslim face in Mumbai. Last week, he said he was with the Congress but would not comment about his future.
Jolt to Congress
Mumbai Congress chief Varsha Gaikwad described Siddique’s decision to quit the party as “disappointing and self-serving”.
“Baba Siddique’s decision to move on after years of service to the Congress and the trust placed in him is deeply disappointing and most regrettable. That he has chosen to do this at a time when our country is at a critical juncture and the entire Congress Parivar is engaged in fighting against the systemic murder of democracy by the BJP is quite telling,” Gaikwad said.
“However, the Congress remains steadfast in its commitment to serving our city and country with integrity and dedication. We won’t let self-serving actions derail us from our mission towards achieving Nyay (justice) for all,” she said.
The Ajit NCP is looking to capitalise on Siddique’s influence in the minority community in Mumbai to expand its base in the city. Currently, Sameer Bhujbal, nephew of senior minister Chhagan Bhujbal, is the party’s Mumbai unit chief. The Ajit NCP may however prefer a Mumbai face to lead its city unity, sources said. It is also hoping to take Zeeshan on board to stake claim on the Bandra East constituency in the upcoming polls, given that the Bandra West seat is with its ally BJP being represented by Mumbai BJP chief Ashish Shelar.",politics
"Special Category Status for Andhra: 5 years later, Jagan in Chandrababu Naidu’s shoes","Since the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh in 2014, the state’s politics has been revolving around the Special Category Status (SCS) for it, even as the two major parties – Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and the ruling YSRCP of Jagan Mohan Reddy – have been unable to coax the Centre in granting the demand.
Like the issue haunted then CM Chandrababu Naidu ahead of the 2019 simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly polls in the state, Jagan faces the same predicament now and is likely to be in Delhi on Thursday to seek clarity from the BJP, as pressure from the Opposition TDP and Congress mounts back at home.
Must Read  | Jagan hopes for a govt at Centre ‘that will rely on us for support’, not have absolute majority
The SCS for Andhra Pradesh is one of the provisions of the AP Reorganisation Act, which led to the formation of Telangana in June 2014.Advertisement
Riding on the SCS issue, Jagan had swept the 2019 elections, with his party winning 151 of the 175 seats and 23 of the 25 Lok Sabha seats in the state. Jagan constantly raised the issue during his Praja Sankalpa Yatra, which began in Idupulapaya of Kadapa district in November 2017, and slammed Naidu for not being able to get SCS for the state. He also accused the TDP chief of going soft on the BJP despite it going back on its promise of granting SCS to Andhra Pradesh.
His attacks on the TDP over the SCS had also led to the Naidu-led party breaking ties with the BJP-led NDA government in March 2018 while accusing the Narendra Modi government of ignoring pleas for SCS. In protest, Naidu had also asked two Union ministers – Ashok Gajapathi Raju and Y Satyanarayana Chowdhary – to resign from the NDA Cabinet. The TDP chief then went on to launch an anti-Modi campaign ahead of the 2019 elections, a move which eventually backfired.
The TDP chief was also ridiculed by YSRCP MLAs, including Jagan, in the Assembly when he said he had visited Delhi 29 times over the years to meet NDA ministers on the SCS issue.
Five years later, Jagan seems to be in Naidu’s shoes. The CM on Tuesday said in the Assembly that no party should get majority at the Centre in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. “I wish any party that comes to power will have to rely on the YSRCP for support. If there is a government that is favourable to us, we can bargain for SCS for Andhra Pradesh,” he said during the discussion on the Motion of Thanks to the Governor’s address.Advertisement

Apart from the TDP, Jagan has been facing flak from a new rival – his sister and Andhra Congress chief, Y S Sharmila – who has been demanding a discussion on the issue in the Assembly and urged Jagan to pass a resolution in the Assembly. Sharmila also held a protest at AP Bhavan in New Delhi on February 2 while blaming the CM for not doing enough to get SCS for the state.
Though the Congress has no representation in the Assembly, the issue is likely to snowball and provide adequate ammunition to the TDP ahead of the polls.
A YSRCP leader admitted that the SCS issue has gained precedence despite the state government implementing various other schemes. “The government implemented DBT welfare schemes worth Rs 2.55 lakh crore and non-DBT schemes worth Rs 1.07 lakh crore yet the SCS issue has gained prominence. The CM’s statement in the Assembly says a lot,” he said.",politics
"BJP-JD(S) talks in Karnataka in final lap, Kumaraswamy may get Chikkaballapur, no clarity on other Gowdas","As the BJP and Janata Dal (Secular) enter the final stages of seat-sharing talks for the Lok Sabha elections, the speculation in the JD(S) is that party leader and former Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy will be asked to contest from Chikkaballapur, a seat currently held by the BJP. However, there is no unanimity on the candidature of two other members of the JD(S) first family.
Of the 28 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state, the JD(S) is likely to get 3-4, according to party sources. While the JD(S) wants Hassan and Mandya, the other likely seats for the party will be Tumkur, Chikkaballapur, or Kolar. BJP leader and former minister K Sudhakar, incidentally, is interested in contesting from Chikkaballapur as well.
Must Read  | D K Suresh’s ‘separate country’ remark an echo of Cong’s pro-Kannada pitch to counter BJP’s Hindutva
Another seat Kumaraswamy is being considered from is Mandya. The former CM, after meeting Union Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP president J P Nadda in Delhi on January 17, said there were requests for him from several constituencies to contest the Lok Sabha polls.Advertisement
JD(S) founder and former prime minister H D Deve Gowda earlier hinted at Kumaraswamy contesting the elections, saying he could be fielded “if Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah want him to contest”. With Deve Gowda having retired from electoral politics, Kumaraswamy is the party’s most high-profile face right now and gives the party a good chance to be represented in Parliament. At present, JD(S) has one Lol Sabha MP.
A one-term MP elected from Bengaluru Rural in 2009, Kumaraswamy lost to the Congress’s Veerappa Moily in 2014 from Chikkaballapur. He is currently an MLA from Channapatna in Bengaluru Rural. The JD(S) won 19 Assembly seats in the elections last year, as a Congress surge decimi
The speculation in the party is that three candidates from the Gowda family could be in the fray this time. “According to our assessment, we could win Chikkaballapur if Kumaraswamy contests and Mandya if someone from the Gowda family is fielded. We have a winning candidate in Hassan too. But, there are some reservations about the candidate,” a JD(S) insider said.
While Kumaraswamy’s son Nikhil is a probable candidate from Mandya, Deve Gowda’s other grandson Prajwal Revanna, the son of former minister H D Revanna, who won from Hassan in 2019 is likely to be the party’s choice again from its stronghold.Advertisement
But both the choices have not been locked down. If Kumaraswamy contests from Chikkaballapur, former minister C S Puttaraju of the JD(S) and former JD(S) MLA Suresh Gowda who is now in the BJP will be among the front-runners for Mandya. Nikhil does not have a strong electoral record and lost both the 2019 parliamentary election from Mandya and the Assembly election last year from Ramanagara in Bengaluru Rural. After the Ramanagara defeat, Nikhil resigned as JD(S) youth wing president and Kumaraswamy said he had advised him to “stay away from politics” for at least five years and concentrate on his movie career.

Some in the BJP are also not keen on Prajwal Revanna’s candidature from Hassan, which is considered to be the bastion of the Gowda family. The former PM won the seat five times before vacating it to his grandson in 2019. Last year, a single-judge Bench of the Karnataka High Court declared his election null and void over alleged electoral malpractices but refused to declare one of the candidates who filed the complaint the winner, saying he was also involved in “corrupt practices”. The Supreme Court subsequently stayed the High Court order.
Among those in the BJP not keen on Prajwal’s candidature are state BJP general secretary and former Hassan MLA Preetham Gowda, who does not see eye to eye with the Revanna family, and former minister C T Ravi. JD(S) insiders said Deve Gowda was campaigning frequently in Hassan to ensure that the family retains the seat.",politics
SP MP who spoke on Gyanvapi: ‘Current politics against Muslims … Silsila of making claims on religious places should stop’,"A first-time MP from Moradabad of the Samajwadi Party and a practising surgeon, Dr S T Hasan, 65, went further than his party has gone on the Gyanvapi mosque issue in his speech in Parliament on February 5, when he said: “The Supreme Court gave a verdict and the Ram Temple issue was resolved. It was a verdict and not justice, but it was resolved. Now the issue of another mosque has come up… Gyanvapi… then there will be Mathura… then Taj Mahal, Qutub Minar and Delhi’s Jama Masjid. When people make claims on 3,000 mosques, we have to think about what we are giving to our next generations, love or hate.” Hasan speaks to The Indian Express about claims on Muslim religious places, problems in the INDIA coalition for the Lok Sabha polls, and other issues.
Excerpts:
You have called the Supreme Court decision on Ayodhya a verdict, and not justice. Why do you say so?
The Supreme Court accepted that whatever happened on December 6, 1992, was a crime. It also accepted that no evidence of a temple was found under the (Babri) mosque. It then went on to resolve the matter between the two communities by awarding the disputed land to the Hindus, even when no proof of a temple was found and a crime was seen to have been committed there.
There was tension between the two communities for hundreds of years because of the issue. We all respect the Supreme Court. Everyone had assured beforehand that they would accept whatever decision it took. Hence, that matter got resolved so easily. That’s why I said that it was a verdict, but that justice was not done.Advertisement

The Indian Union Muslim League Kerala chief recently called the Ram Temple and the mosque proposed nearby to resolve the dispute as ‘symbols of secularism’, and said there was no need to protest against the temple.
The Ram Temple is now built. Muslims too respect Ramchandraji. I also do. But using Ramchandra ji for petty benefits is against decorum. The politics of using religion to achieve certain goals is not good for the nation and future generations.
Recently, puja began in the cellar of the Gyanvapi mosque, while petitions are pending seeking an ASI survey of the disputed Shahi Idgah in Mathura. How do you view these?
There is the Places of Worship Act, 1991. Its provision to ensure status quo in religious places (barring Babri dispute) was a big relief. We are hopeful that the court will follow the law. Certainly, the court makes the decision based on laws. But kattarpanthis (hardliners) are making claims on Gyanvapi, after that Mathura, then (they could move on to) Taj Mahal, Delhi’s Jama Masjid, Qutub Minar and 3,000 other mosques. That is an endless agenda. Is it sending a good message for the country? We can guess where the country is headed. We are hopeful that courts will take decisions that maintain communal harmony.
I believe senior BJP leaders like Modiji (Prime Minister Narendra Modi), Rajnath Singh (Defence Minister), Nitin Gadkari (Road, Transport and Highways Minister), etc, are also concerned about communal harmony. But they have got trapped in a political bhanvar (whirlwind) and are unable to come out of that. Leaders across parties in the country are well-wishers of the country… But people are using easy methods of communalising politics, taking support of religious sentiments to move ahead.

If social harmony is disturbed by making claims on 3,000 mosques, will that be in the interest of the country or of communal harmony? Till when shall one community musalsal (continuously) tolerate? I believe, this silsila (affair) of making claims on religious places should stop. We should be allowed to live with love and harmony.Advertisement
I am a surgeon. Even in this prevailing atmosphere, I see Hindus donating blood to save the lives of Muslims and vice-versa. Our harmony has not been disturbed as of now and we trust each other. But doubts have entered minds and the distance is increasing.
You also said in your speech that many things about the Narendra Modi government are appreciable.
The G20 summit increased the glory of the country. Our athletes won 100 medals for the first time in the Asian Games. Khelo India was a good scheme. We know positive politics. Chandrayaan’s success is our glory. Which is good, that is appreciable.
Uttarakhand has just passed a Uniform Civil Code law. Do you see it as precursor to a nationwide UCC?
These are political stunts. What is the need for a UCC? Muslims, Hindus, tribals are governed by their own laws. The country has been running smoothly for the past 76 years. There is no personal law of Muslims that causes problems to others. For the past 1,450 years, we (Muslims) have given women their right to ancestral property. We cannot avoid the Quran. If I ask Hindu brothers to bury their dead instead of burning them, will they accept? No one has any problem with the rituals of others… If, with the consent of the first wife, in a situation that she has serious illness or she is unable to give birth, we get into a second marriage, why should others have problems with that? If the wife is corrupt and we divorce her to marry another woman, why is there any objection? Also, the actual percentage of second marriages in Muslims is low.

You have legalised live-in relationships. So, a person can live with two, four or six partners, that is legal. You only object if somebody is getting married a second time.Advertisement
If the BJP government legislates UCC in UP, what will you do as an SP MP?
I am against it. The SP will protest. Jaise Hindu bandhe hue hain apne kanoonon se, hum bhi apne kanoon se bandhe hue hain (Just like Hindus are bound by their laws, we too are bound by our laws). We take the Quran as the last word. We will oppose every law that is against the Quran. The instant triple talaq law was accepted… but it is also being misused.
Opposition parties are largely choosing silent on the issues of minorities now. Why?
The current politics is against Muslims. The target are Muslims. In the BJP, one can become a tall party leader according to how he tortures Muslims… Communalism is at its peak. In this situation, if they (the Opposition) speak about rights and justice, they fear non-Muslim voters will get upset.
You are an MP from western UP, where the SP has left seven seats for the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD). Now, there is speculation that the RLD is going to go with the NDA. Is there any disturbance within the alliance?
The RLD is ready to contest on seven seats, but there are rumours that the BJP is wooing the party by assuring four seats. It is well-known that the BJP woos others this way. As far as the Congress is concerned, the alliance is almost finalised. Seat-sharing will also be finalised soon. Top leaders of both parties are in favour of the alliance. All is well in the alliance.",politics
"‘370 seats’: The numbers behind Modi’s target, BJP’s maths, Opposition’s challenge","In his final speech in the Lok Sabha on Monday, while replying to the Motion of Thanks on President Droupadi Murmu’s address, Prime Minister Narendra Modi set a target of 370 seats for the ruling BJP in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections and 400 seats for the NDA.
Modi spent a considerable portion of his speech targeting the Congress, the leader of the Opposition INDIA bloc, projecting the party as the BJP’s main challenger. “They cobbled together a coalition a few days ago, but now are walking alone. The Congress people have learnt the job of a motor mechanic. So, they must have learnt about alignment. But I am seeing that the alignment of the alliance has deteriorated,” Modi said, in what seemed to be a reference to Rahul Gandhi’s visit to a bike mechanic shop in Delhi last year.
Exemplifying the party’s confidence heading into the Lok Sabha polls, Modi said that the “third tenure” of the BJP would lay a strong foundation for “progress in the next 1,000 years”.Advertisement
Political Pulse | Framing LS poll battle, why PM Modi gave Congress undivided attention in House speech
While the BJP has struggled against some regional parties in recent state polls, in bipolar Assembly contests against the Congress, it has largely won. In the Lok Sabha elections, on the other hand, the BJP has increased its seat tally and vote share in consecutive elections, since its defeat in 2009. After winning a majority with 282 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP further extended its lead by 21 seats to 303 in the 2019 polls. To hit Modi’s target of 370 seats this time, the BJP will need to win 67 more seats.
Here’s how the BJP fared in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and the state elections since then.
Lok Sabha
The BJP’s 303 seats in 2019 were spread across the country, including all the constituencies in nine states and UTs, and a near sweep in another five.
 BJP seats won in 2019 LS polls
While the BJP had contested 428 seats in 2014 and won 282, it improved its strike rate in 2019 by a significant margin despite contesting in just 8 more seats, winning 303 of the 436 seats in which it fought.Advertisement
From 2014 to 2019, the BJP gained 44 seats in 10 states and lost 23 in 10 states and UTs, for a net gain of 21 seats. Its biggest gains were in West Bengal (16 seats) followed by Karnataka (8), Odisha (7), Haryana and Telangana (3 each). But the party won fewer seats in UP (9), Bihar (5) and Andhra Pradesh (2).
As part of its preparation for the 2024 polls, the BJP is paying special attention to the 133 seats it contested and lost in 2019.
 BJP position in lost seats
In these seats, it finished as the runner-up in 72 seats, of which 22 were in Bengal, 16 in UP, 11 in Odisha and 5 in Tamil Nadu. In 56 of these 72 seats, the BJP was pipped by non-Congress regional parties, including in 21 by the Trinamool Congress (TMC), 11 by the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) and 10 by the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). The Congress bested the BJP in 15 of these seats.
In another 31 seats, including 14 in Kerala and 9 in Telangana, the BJP was placed third. In 7 seats, 4 of them in Andhra Pradesh, the BJP was placed fourth. In 23 seats, 20 of them in Andhra, the BJP finished fifth, sixth or seventh.Advertisement
Nearly half of these 133 seats – 59 – fell in southern states, where the BJP has historically had little presence. This explains the BJP’s special focus in the area in the run-up to these elections.

In terms of its vote shares in the states, between 2014 and 2019, the BJP saw a rise in 22 states and UTs, and fall in 12.
Overall, the party’s vote share rose from 31.3% in 2014 to 37.7% in 2019. In 2019, it won more than 50% of the votes in 14 states and UTs, compared to 7 in 2014.

A comparison of vote shares in 2014 and 2019 shows that the BJP saw the biggest gains in Tripura (43.8%-point increase in vote share), followed by West Bengal (23.6%-points), Haryana (23.4%-points) and Manipur (22.4%-points). The increase in vote share was more than 20%-points in four states, and more than 10%-points in seven states and the UT of Delhi.Advertisement
Among the states and UTs where its vote share fell were Arunachal Pradesh (15.5%-point decline), Daman and Diu (10.9%-points), and Dadra and Nagar Haveli (8.2%-points). The BJP’s vote share fell in Bihar, too, likely because it fought in an alliance with the JD(U). Besides a dip of 7.2%-points in Himachal Pradesh, its vote share losses were largely restricted to states with very few seats and those where it has a limited presence, including Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.
Assembly polls
Since the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, there have been Assembly elections in 30 states and UTs. Over the course of the state elections in the past five years, the BJP has lost power in 4 Assemblies, gained 3 and held 12, including some with coalition governments.
Despite losing out in several states, including Maharashtra and Bihar, in the polls, the party has managed to return to power after the sitting governments collapsed. As things stand, with the return of the JD(U) into the NDA fold last month, the BJP and its allies rule 18 states and UTs going into the general elections.
In terms of vote shares at the state level, the BJP has a considerable presence across the country. In the polls held since 2019, the BJP has secured at least 20% of the vote share in 19 states and UTs and more than 40% in 9.Advertisement
 BJP vote shares in Assembly polls
Compared to the state elections held prior to 2019, the BJP saw its vote share increase in 20 states and UTs and decrease in 10. The biggest increase was recorded in Bengal, where its vote share rose from 10.3% in 2016 to 38% in 2021 – a fact that the ruling TMC is very well aware of. The biggest decline was in Himachal Pradesh, from 49.2% in 2017 when it won the polls to 43% in 2022, when the state became one of the few the BJP lost to the Congress.",politics
"Sharad Pawar back to drawing board after losing NCP to Ajit, braces for toughest battle at 83","At 83, Sharad Pawar is facing a new challenge in his political career spanning over six decades to rebuild his party again. However, unlike the past when he fought many a battle against his political rivals, this time the gauntlet has been thrown by his nephew and ex-protege Ajit Pawar, the Deputy Chief Minister in the NDA-led Maharashtra government.
On Tuesday, the Election Commission (EC) declared Ajit-led NCP group as the “real” NCP, handing it both the party’s original name and its symbol “clock”.
Must Read  | Sharad Pawar faction gets new name day after Ajit camp declared ‘real’ NCP
While giving its ruling, the EC asked Pawar-led NCP faction to suggest a list of three preferences for its name for the upcoming Rajya Sabha elections in Maharashtra. On Wednesday, accepting the faction’s first preference, the EC allotted it the name, “Nationalist Congress Party-Sharadchandra Pawar”.Advertisement
It is another matter that Pawar is the founder of the NCP, with Ajit rebelling against him to cross over to the NDA in July 2023 along with his group of party leaders and legislators.
The question doing the rounds in the state political circles is, will Pawar succeed in reconstituting and revamping his party again.
With his political skills and unrelenting work, Pawar has continued to remain a key figure at the centre-stage of Maharashtra politics for decades. Even his detractors acknowledge his “never say die attitude” and are not willing to write him off. As they track his next moves, a common refrain among them is, “Pawar may be down, but not out yet”.
Read  | What next for Sharad Pawar? Choosing a new party name and symbol immediate task
Pawar is gearing up for one of the toughest battles of his career now. With the Lok Sabha polls round the corner, he has barely a couple of months to reinvent his party. He will also have to mount an aggressive statewide outreach to secure public approval for his party’s new identity.Advertisement
On the EC’s ruling, state NCP chief Jayant Patil said, “Yes, it is a setback. But then we will fight back with greater zeal. We have Sharad Pawar with us. The name Sharad Pawar itself is our identity and party.”
NCP working president Supriya Sule, Pawar’s daughter, said they will challenge the EC’s order in the Supreme Court. The party has started consultations with constitutional and legal experts.
Notwithstanding the legal fight, the immediate task for Pawar is to make his organisation battle-ready for the Lok Sabha polls.
An NCP strategist from the Pawar faction said, “The EC’s order divesting Sharad Pawar-led NCP of title and symbol may generate sympathy among public. This sympathy factor in Pawar’s favour could work to our advantage. And we would bank on it to see that our organisation and electoral base remain intact in Maharashtra.”Advertisement
In October 2019, Pawar had held a rally at Satara for the Lok Sabha bypoll, during which he got drenched in the rain. The image of a soaked Pawar delivering his speech while defying the rain, which went viral, evoked sympathy for the Maratha stalwart, with NCP candidate Shriniwas Patil winning the election by defeating the BJP’s Udayan Raje Bhosale.
The Satara bypoll was held along with the elections to the 288-member state Assembly. Pawar’s rain speech was believed to have even boosted the NCP’s prospects in the Assembly polls, which won 54 seats, with its ally Congress winning 44. The BJP won 105 seats while its ally Shiv Sena got 56, with their numbers dipping from their previous figures.
Subsequently, the Uddhav-led Sena cut its ties with the BJP and formed the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government along with the NCP and the Congress. Pawar was said to have been a key architect of the MVA alliance, which had stumped the BJP.
NCP insiders point out how Pawar has faced multiple challenges, both political and personal, over the decades.Advertisement

Today in Politics: Vijayan Cabinet to hold protest against Modi govt at Jantar Mantar; BJP vs Cong on economy rages,"A day after Karnataka Chief Minister and Congress leader Siddaramaiah along with his entire Cabinet staged a protest at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar against the BJP-ruled Centre’s alleged injustice to the state in devolution of taxes and release of funds, Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan and his CPM-led LDF Cabinet will hold a similar protest on the issue at the same venue Thursday.
The Vijayan government’s protest will be supported by the DMK MPs. Tamil Nadu CM and DMK supremo M K Stalin has already extended his backing to Vijayan over his Delhi protest. AAP leader and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and his counterpart in Punjab, Bhagwant Mann, too, will be joining the protest.
On the eve of his protest, as reported by Liz Mathew, Vijayan told a press conference, “Social welfare and development expenditure in the state has been hampered due to financial constraints created by the unconstitutional approach of the Central government. This agitation is intended to safeguard the constitutional rights of all states, not merely Kerala.”Advertisement
Vijayan clarified that the coming together of the non-BJP parties or a so-called southern alliance should not be seen as a north-south divide. “It’s about the states getting their rights and what is due for them. It’s an issue concerning the entire country,” he said.
Several southern states have criticised the Narendra Modi government in recent years over its tax devolution policies and losing out on tax revenue. As they hit the streets of Delhi in protest, there is also talk about the southern states forming an alliance to seek their “rightful share” in taxes devolved by the Centre and protest against alleged disparities in allocation of Central funds, as reported by Akram M and Shaju Philip.
Already, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu have banded together, while Andhra Pradesh CM Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy also spoke about the “reduction in devolution of Central funds and reduced tax revenues” in the state Assembly on Wednesday, as reported by Sreenivas Janyala.
CM Siddaramaiah’s economic adviser Basavaraj Rayareddy had talked of the southern states floating an alliance that will serve as a forum from which they can articulate their position before the 16th Finance Commission.Advertisement
In Parliament, however, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday that the devolution of taxes was based on the recommendations of the Finance Commission and that she had no discretionary powers. Sitharaman said 100% of state GST was transferred automatically to the states and roughly 50% of the integrated GST was shared with the states and periodically readjusted to actuals.
While Karnataka is demanding Rs 1.87 lakh crore from the Centre in losses allegedly incurred by the state under the 15th Finance Commission, Kerala claims it has lost Rs 1.08 lakh crores between 2016 and 2023.
BJP vs Cong on economic management
With the Modi government extending the ongoing Budget Session of Parliament by a day to February 10 to bring in a white paper on the state of the economy before and after 2014, when the BJP came to power after defeating the Congress-led UPA, the face-off between the BJP and the Congress on the issue is escalating.
During his reply in both Houses of Parliament to the motion of thanks on President’s address, PM Modi slammed the UPA government’s alleged mishandling of the economy and its corruption and policy paralysis.Advertisement
Hitting back, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said Wednesday, “Modiji, in your speeches in both the Houses, you only cursed the Congress. Despite being in power for 10 years, instead of talking about himself, he only criticises the Congress party. Even today, he did not talk about price rise, unemployment and economic inequality.”
On Thursday morning, Kharge will hold a press conference, which is likely to focus on economic issues. It will also follow his row with Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar over his expunged remarks from his February 2 speech in the Rajya Sabha, where taking a dig at the BJP, Kharge said the party’s tally would go “400 paar (beyond 400 seats)” in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.
On Wednesday too, Kharge urged Dhankhar to restore expunged parts of his speech, saying that two pages from it were removed and thus the intent of his speech was distorted. He said he said “400 paar”, but the words after that were removed, changing the meaning. Dhankar, however, refused to restore to expunged remarks, saying Kharge had “sufficient time to revisit his thoughts” in the remainder of his speech.
PM to honour spiritual guru
PM Modi is set to address an event Thursday to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of spiritual guru Srila Prabhupada at the Bharat Mandapam convention centre in the national capital.

Budget Session of Assemblies
Apart from Parliament, several state Assemblies are in the midst of their own Budget Sessions.
In Arunachal Pradesh and Telangana, the Budget Session is set to commence on Thursday. In Telangana, the Congress government led by CM Revanth Reddy will announce the implementation of two more of its pre-poll guarantees. The Congress dispensation had earlier initiated the implementation of two promises – free travel in state-run RTC buses for women and a health scheme of Rs 10 lakh.
In West Bengal and Goa, the Budget is set to be tabled in the respective Assemblies on Thursday. In Odisha, where the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls will be held simultaneously, the government will present an interim Budget on Thursday.

"Upset with Congress for skipping Ayodhya event, Jabalpur Mayor, Digvijaya aide cross over to BJP","In a setback to the Congress in Madhya Pradesh just a couple of months before the Lok Sabha elections, Jabalpur Mayor Jagat Singh Annu quit the party to join the ruling BJP Wednesday, saying he was upset with the Congress since it declined the invitation for the Ram Mandir consecration ceremony in Ayodhya last month.
Annu took membership of the BJP at the party headquarters in Bhopal in the presence of Chief Minister Mohan Yadav, state BJP chief V D Sharma, former state home minister Narottam Mishra, among other senior leaders, which highlighted the importance of the event as Annu was the first Congress Mayor in Jabalpur in 18 years. He was also considered close to former CM Kamal Nath and another senior Congress leader Vivek Tankha.
Jabalpur is the nerve centre of the Mahakaushal region where the Congress has been reduced to nine Assembly seats, most of which are in Chhindwara, Kamal Nath’s home turf.Advertisement
Annu said he was “hurt since the day Congress rejected the invitation to go to the Pran Pratishtha (consecration) of Lord Ram Mandir”.
Explained | Congress and Ram Mandir: Brief history of the party’s flip-flops on Ayodhya temple
He said, “I will develop Jabalpur as a metropolis with the development policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the double engine government.”
Meanwhile, in Guna, Congress leader Sumer Singh, a known loyalist of former CM Digvijaya Singh, also switched to the BJP, citing the same reason as Annu.
Sumer told The Indian Express, “I have always been with the Congress. I left the party as I was angry over the way it dealt with the Ram Mandir event. He is our God and we express our love to him. I can’t be with a party which disrespects Ram. We can’t accept it.”Advertisement
Sumer, who was elected as the Guna district panchayat president as the Congress nominee during 2010-15, joined the BJP Wednesday in the presence of Union Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, who had walked out of the Congress with his loyalists in early 2020.
Along with Annu, several other Congress leaders – including Dindori’s district panchayat president Rudesh Paraste and vice-president Anju Jitendra Beohar, Singrauli’s district panchayat vice-president Archana Singh – joined the BJP. Their induction into the BJP is being seen as the pary’s bid to further weaken the Congress and bolster its prospects in the Lok Sabha elections.
Political Pulse | Staying away from Ram temple on January 22 is Congress’s cold comfort zone
A few days ago, Congress leader Ekta Thakur, its candidate from the Mahakaushal region’s Sihora seat in the November Assembly elections, joined the BJP. On January 19, former Congress MLA from Morena and a Scindia loyalist, Rakesh Mavai, switched to the BJP.
The Jabalpur Mayor had been complaining about the “difficulty” in getting work done in the city with some Congress leaders close to him alleging that he was “pressured” by the BJP to join the party.Advertisement
Following the Congress’s rout in the Assembly polls, Annu was said to be warming up to senior BJP leaders, including CM Yadav, in public, as seen during Union Minister Nitin Gadkari’s visit to Jabalpur last month.
“Ahead of the Ram Mandir event, Annu went on an overdrive to ensure that Jabalpur was decked up for the celebrations, even as he promised to take all the councillors to Ayodhya,” sources close to him said.
The state Congress was stunned by Annu’s move, with its spokesperson K K Mishra declining to make any comment. A Congress leader however said his exit has jolted the party workers ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. “This is another win for the BJP which is aiming to eventually make its way to Chhindwara and also win that lone seat (out of 29 seats) it did not win in 2019 Lok Sabha polls,” he said.
At the Bhopal event, welcoming Annu and other Congress leaders into the BJP fold, CM Yadav said, “BJP family is growing and there is a waiting list of leaders to join the party.”Advertisement
He said, “Those who took the BJP membership today were upset with the Congress because in the Congress the family (Nehru-Gandhi family) progresses, while in the BJP due to collective leadership even a small worker like me gets respect. All these leaders now want to follow PM Modi’s leadership and develop their respective areas.”
V D Sharma said, “Mahakoshal is becoming Congress-free and now even Congress has Modi in their mind.”
He also said, “Today, leaders from Jabalpur to Dindori have joined the party. I assure that everyone will get an opportunity to work with respect…We will win all 29 Lok Sabha seats in the state.”",politics
"As Lok Sabha passes Bill giving J-K groups ST status, Pir Panjal on guard, Omar Abdullah says ‘stopped’ from visit","Amid apprehensions of protests over the Lok Sabha clearing a Bill extending Scheduled Tribe status to several communities in Jammu and Kashmir, the Union Territory administration on Wednesday resorted to precautionary measures, including suspension of mobile Internet in the Pir Panjal region covering Rajouri and Poonch districts.
While the situation remained peaceful, a political row erupted over National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah being stopped from visiting the border Rajouri district.
The former chief minister claimed that the police initially locked him up inside his house in Jammu, and later, escorted him to his office in Sher-i-Kashmir Bhawan “like a criminal”, stopping him from going to Sunderbani town in Rajouri for a party function. “The Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO) accompanied me… It is the first time the SDPO accompanied me from my house to the office to personally see to it that my vehicle does not take any other turn,” he said.Advertisement
The NC said there was no official order on the basis of which the former CM was stopped.

While the police denied any curbs on Omar’s movement, on Wednesday, the Jammu district administration issued a general direction prohibiting individuals and social media news platforms from sharing any post / message that could disturb harmony or peace. Jammu District Magistrate Sachin Kumar Vaishya issued the order, referring to inputs regarding posting of social media posts which could lead to “serious breach of peace and order… might cause grave danger to human lives and properties”.
Sources in the UT administration said there was apprehension that “vested interests” may try to take advantage of misgivings among the Gujjars and Bakerwals over the extension of the ST status. Paharis, Padari Tribes, Koli and Gadda Brahmins in J&K are to be classified as STs as per the Constitution (Jammu and Kashmir) Scheduled Tribes Order (Amendment) Bill, 2024, passed by the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.
The area is on high alert both due to the coming Lok Sabha elections as well as the ongoing anti-militancy operations in Rajouri and Poonch districts following a series of incidents.Advertisement
Union Home Minister Amit Shah first promised the Paharis ST status at his first-ever public rally in Rajouri, in 2022, while assuring the Gujjars and Bakerwals that it would not impact the reservation available to them.
Also in J&K | Srinagar militant attack leaves Amritsar resident dead, another critical
However, the Gujjars and Bakerwals remain wary particularly as, after the abrogation of Article 370 and delimitation, for the first time constituencies have been reserved for STs in J&K. Of the 9 ST-reserved Assembly seats, 6 fall in the Jammu province (5 of them in Rajouri and Poonch; 1 in Reasi), and 3 in Kashmir (1 each in Anantnag, Ganderbal and Bandipora districts). Plus, the Anantnag Lok Sabha seat now includes almost the entire Rajouri and Poonch districts.
With a population of nearly 18 lakh in J&K, the Gujjars and Bakerwals, who are predominantly Muslim, outnumber the other groups now under ST, whose combined strength is less than 2 lakh.
The Gujjars and Bakerwals, along with Shinas (Shin and Dard), Gaddi and Sippis, were qualified as STs in 1991. This entitles them to 10% quota in government jobs and admissions to educational institutions (including professional colleges).Advertisement
The government’s assurance of a separate reservation quota for those now set to be included as STs, and the Gujjars and Bakerwals, has failed to soothe the latter as they believe this can be ensured only at the level of the UT, and not for national-level government jobs or seats in educational institutions.
Political Pulse | Five takeaways from Modi’s last speech in 17th LS: eyeing hat-trick to flagging Cong’s free fall
The Gujjars and Bakerwals are opposed to essentially the inclusion of Paharis, a generic term used for people of Pir Panjal, saying they are a combination of different religions and communities and not “one ethnic group” – unlike the Padari tribes, Kolis and Gadda Brahmins, who also stand to become STs.
The Paharis, who make up a substantial 40% of the population in Pir Panjal, have been demanding ST status on the ground that they too face similar challenges due to the area’s tough geography and the absence of educational and health facilities.
The BJP has been trying to woo the Gujjars and Bakerwals since it came to power for the first time in J&K in coalition with the PDP after the 2014 Assembly polls. It hopes to retain that support, apart from getting the backing of Paharis now. Potentially, this can help it win Anantnag, thus planting the BJP flag in Kashmir region.Advertisement
The BJP’s calculation is that while the move to increase the ST basket may alienate some Gujjars and Bakerwals, not all will turn away from the party as they don’t vote en bloc. In the wake of recent militant strikes in the Pir Panjal region, and consequent Army action leading to civilian deaths, the UT administration had acted quickly to stem public anger.
BJP national general secretary and J&K in-charge Tarun Chugh Wednesday said the grant of ST status to Paharis was a “watershed moment” for J&K, and criticised Opposition parties for “politicising the matter” for their vested interests.
On Omar not being allowed to visit Rajouri, J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina said he may have been stopped due to “security threats”, referring to the recent militancy incidents in Rajouri and Poonch.
Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha also welcomed the Bill, and appealed to community elders to “discharge their responsibilities well and counter any misinformation” regarding level of reservation to communities. “I reiterate that the inclusion of new communities… will not impact the current level of reservations available to the existing Scheduled Tribe communities such as Gujjars and Bakarwals,” Sinha said.",politics
RLD’s silence on meetings with BJP sets off speculation; spooks SP,"The silence of the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), amidst reports of its meetings with leaders of the BJP-led NDA, signals the continuing unease between the INDIA bloc partners in Uttar Pradesh and opens up questions on the future of the partnership.
The Congress and the Samajwadi Party (SP) are currently attempting to fend off issues and settle on seat-sharing numbers. The RLD, the third partner in the alliance which shares a relationship with the SP, was allotted seven seats by SP chief Akhilesh Yadav in January. However, RLD leaders are said to be unhappy about the lack of clarity on which seats it will be contesting.

Sources told The Indian Express that other RLD leaders have also been told to avoid media queries about these speculations.
In another sign that all is not well between the SP and RLD, Akhilesh on Wednesday seemed to be attempting to dissuade the RLD from joining the NDA.
Speaking to reporters in Lucknow, he said: “Jayant Chaudhary is an educated person and he understands politics well. I am hopeful that he will not let the fight for farmers and prosperity of UP be weakened.”Advertisement

Sources said the RLD was given to understand that it would be getting Baghpat, Kairana, Mathura, Hathras, and Fatehpur Sikri seats in its alliance with the SP, with discussions said to be ongoing regarding Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Bijnor and Amroha.

"Chandrababu Naidu in Delhi amid talk of TDP-BJP tie-up, top leaders count the gains","With speculation rife that his party may return to the NDA fold ahead of the simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh, Telugu Desam Party chief N Chandrababu Naidu arrived in New Delhi on Wednesday. He was expected to meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP president J P Nadda either later on Wednesday or Thursday.
Sources said the TDP chief will seek clarity on an alliance, with the BJP so far choosing to be equidistant to both the TDP and its main rival in Andhra, the YSRCP. A close aide of a TDP leader accompanying Naidu to Delhi said the talks between the TDP-Jana Sena party (JSP) combine and the BJP have been on for some time. “The BJP has been demanding 8-10 Lok Sabha seats but the TDP is ready to give only 4-5,” he said.
Also read | BJP-TDP thaw? Chandrababu Naidu’s son feels the warmth as he gets a meeting with Amit Shah
Sources said while some leaders remain opposed to a tie-up, the top leadership of both parties is keen. In case of the TDP, while the JSP may be more profitable electorally, its leadership sees safety (read against probe by central agencies) in friendly ties with the BJP.Advertisement
The TDP’s top leadership is also looking at “the larger picture”, and believes that a formal alliance with the BJP would lift its stature and make it equal to the ruling YSRCP. “Currently, YSRCP chief Jagan Mohan Reddy is helping or supporting the BJP. Once a TDP-BJP alliance is formally announced, he will be forced to take the BJP head-on in the state,” a TDP MP said.
For the BJP, a tie-up with the TDP would mean a win for the party in at least some Lok Sabha seats. “The optics would change. For instance, if the BJP contests even five of the 25 Lok Sabha seats in alliance with the TDP, it can hope to win at least 3 with the help of the TDP,” a source said.
Other BJP sources said the party was still watching the developments in the state, where the ruling YSRCP is trying to beat anti-incumbency by dropping or replacing several legislators. “Any discussion would be taken only after we make a firm assessment of the situation,” a BJP leader said.

Expanding the party’s footprint is crucial to the BJP’s goal of winning more seats than in 2019, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi declaring in Parliament that the party would win 370 seats (63 more than last time). Since the party is virtually saturated in the North in terms of Lok Sabha seats, such big addition to its 2019 tally requires a good performance in the south.Advertisement
The BJP was earlier seen as keen on an alliance with the YSRCP as well, but the party has shown no signs of joining the NDA for fear of it hurting its prospects among minorities.
Buzz around the TDP’s re-entry into the NDA has been around since July last year after the latter replaced its state chief Somu Veeraju with Daggubati Purandareswari, the daughter of former Andhra Pradesh CM N T Rama Rao, and Naidu’s sister-in-law. Veeraju along with other party leaders was opposed to an alliance with the TDP, seeing Naidu as “unreliable and opportunistic”.

"5 takeaways from PM Modi’s RS speech: Social justice, to state protests, cites Congress record","Setting the tone for the upcoming general elections and picking up from where he left off in the Lok Sabha, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday continued his attacks on the Congress – challenging the Opposition party on all issues that it has made the centre of its Lok Sabha campaign.
Replying to the debate on the President’s address in the Rajya Sabha, after he had done so in the Lok Sabha on Monday, Modi was again silent on other Opposition parties and singled out the Congress.
The main talking points of the Congress which Modi made a point of taking down included its criticism of his government on representation to OBCs, SCs and STs; handling of national and internal security; “injustice” to southern states; attack on federal principles; and assault on constitutional institutions.Advertisement

Targeting Rahul Gandhi, who is on his second Bharat Jodo Yatra, without naming him, Modi said the Congress had set up a “start-up” for its “prince” which, however, remains a “non-starter”. “Na toh woh lift ho raha hai, na launch ho raha hai (Neither is it getting a lift, nor seeing a launch),” he said.
The PM also exuded confidence about getting a third term in office, framing the objectives and goals of a “Modi 3.0”. Referring to Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee’s remarks that the Congress may not win even 40 seats this time, he said, “Main prarthana karta hun aap 40 bacha payen (I pray that you manage to retain 40).”
The important takeaways from his address in the Rajya Sabha:
Social justice counter: Raises Nehru letter to Sitaram Kesri ouster
The Congress, especially Rahul Gandhi, has been demanding holding of a caste census and talking about abysmal representation of OBCs, SCs and STs at every level. It has also promised to remove the 50% ceiling on reservations through legislation.Advertisement
In his speech, Modi said the Congress neither gave full reservation to OBCs nor to the poor among the general category, and did not find it even fit to bestow Bharat Ratna to Babasaheb Ambedkar. “And this Congress is giving us sermons on social justice!” he said.

“The Congress has always been against Dalits, backwards and tribals. Sometimes I think, had Babasaheb not been there… perhaps SC/STs would not have got reservation,” he said, going on to quote excerpts from a letter written by then PM Jawaharlal Nehru to chief ministers. “I am reading out its translation… ‘I dislike any kind of reservation, more particularly in jobs. I am strongly against anything which leads to inefficiency and second rate standards’… That is why I say that they (the Congress) are against it (reservation) by birth,” Modi said.

On Rahul’s repeated assertion that only three of the 90 bureaucrats at the top level are OBCs, Modi said: “Those who reel out figures today… it is because they had stopped recruitment at that. Had they recruited them in the government and promoted them from time to time, they (the backwards) would have been here today.”
He pointed out that the Congress had fielded a candidate against Droupadi Murmu when the NDA fielded her for the post of President. “It was not an ideological fight… You fielded a candidate (Yashwant Sinha) who had left us (the BJP)… So it was not an ideological opposition. Your opposition was to a tribal daughter. We first made a Dalit (Ram Nath Kovind) and then a tribal (Murmu) President.”Advertisement
Modi also referred to the ouster of Sitaram Kesri as Congress president in 1998. “Kesri, who was from a most backward class, was picked up and thrown on the footpath… That video is available.”
Status of institutions: ‘What about Emergency?’
Taking on the oft-repeated charge of the Congress and other Opposition parties that his government was trampling upon institutions and strangling democracy, Modi referred to the Emergency, and how the government led by Indira Gandhi had “imprisoned the dignity of the Constitution and democracy” and tried to shut down newspapers.
Referring to the dismissal of elected governments using Article 356 under the Congress, the PM said: “This Congress is giving us sermons on democracy and federalism!”
It was the Congress that had left no stone unturned to divide the country on caste, community and religious lines, Modi said.Advertisement

The PM also quoted excerpts from a January 2013 speech by former Congress PM Manmohan Singh to counter the party. He said Singh had said there was anger in the country about the misuse of public offices. “I did not say it… It was the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh,” Modi said, adding that the entire country was then on the streets over the issue of corruption.
National security: ‘Separatism, terrorism, Naxalism… all under Cong’
The Congress has accused the BJP government of failing on both national security and internal security fronts, raising the continuing Manipur crisis and the border dispute with China.
Modi said that it was the Congress whose governments had let separatism and terrorism flourish “to secure its interests”. He accused the party of letting the Northeast descend into violence, separatism and backwardness, letting Naxalism become a challenge, and letting “enemies snatch precious Indian territory”. The PM said the Congress had not allowed modernisation of armed forces either. “And they are giving us sermons on national security and internal security!”
North-South ‘divide’: ‘See nation as a whole, not in parts’
Speaking on the day the entire Karnataka Cabinet staged a protest in Delhi, alleging injustice to the state in devolution of taxes and release of funds, and ahead of a similar protest by the Kerala government, Modi accused the Congress of creating a “North-South divide”.Advertisement
He said the party was, in fact, creating “a new narrative” for dividing the country. “Itna toda kam nahin hai… Uttar-Dakshin koh todne ke liye bayaan diya ja raha hai (What they have divided isn’t enough… statements are being made to divide North and South),” he said.
“I am pained by one thing. The nation is not just land for us, but an inspirational unit. When a thorn pricks one’s foot, it’s the hand that reaches out to extract it. It does not say that it does not care about the foot. The eye also swells with tears. If one part of the body does not work, the whole body is considered disabled. If one part of the country is backward, the nation suffers. The nation has to be seen as a whole, not in parts,” Modi added.
“A national party is thinking of such things? What language is being used today? ‘Our tax, our money’? Stop searching for new narratives to break the nation. We have to take the whole nation forward,” the PM said. “If a Jharkhand boy gets an Olympic medal, do we think he is from Jharkhand? We say he is from our country. If we spend on that boy, it is for the country, not for Jharkhand. Will we ask in which state or city of the country a vaccine was made?” Modi said.
With the Congress slipping in North India, especially after the recent Assembly election results, and thriving largely in the South, including Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala, the PM’s remarks were an attempt to reach out to the South while at the time suggesting to people in the North that the Congress was against their interests.Advertisement
“I have been lucky that I got a chance to serve as Chief Minister for a long time. So, I understand regional aspirations. Digvijaya Singhji (Congress), Deve Gowdaji (JD-S) also understand it. For 10 years, the UPA government tried its level best to do injustice to Gujarat. I don’t cry over it… despite all those problems. I did not get appointments with ministers, who offered to talk on phone but not to meet me as CM, for fear that they may be seen with me on a video camera. There was a natural calamity (in Gujarat). I requested the then PM (Manmohan Singh) to come. He decided to come. But then a committee met (and things changed). He went to the South… He said he would do a survey from the air, but not come (to Gujarat). I understand what might have happened,” Modi said.
Economy: Compares his record to UPA’s
With the Congress repeatedly targeting the government over its handling of the economy and failure to provide enough jobs, Modi focused on his government’s economic initiatives compared to the UPA’s.
He said that during the UPA government’s 10-year period, India moved just one notch up, from the 12th largest economy to 11th, and its situation was among “the fragile five”. The Congress government was also known for policy paralysis, he added. “On the other hand, in our 10 years, India is among the top five economies of the world.”
Modi said that in his time, the PSU numbers have increased and their profits risen to Rs 2.5 lakh crore. Accusing the Opposition of spreading rumours about LIC, he said that PSUs shares today are trading at a record high price. He also accused the Congress of having virtually destroyed PSUs like MTNL, BSNL, HAL, Air India during its 10-year rule.",politics
"Jagan hopes for a govt at Centre ‘that will rely on us for support’, not have absolute majority","AMID TALK of a possible alliance between the BJP and its rival TDP ahead of the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, which are held simultaneously in Andhra Pradesh, Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has said that he wishes that no party comes to power with an absolute majority in the next Lok Sabha elections, as that left the state with little bargaining power.
“I wish any party that comes to power will rely on the YSRCP for support. If there is a government that is favourable to us, then we can bargain for special category status,’’ Jagan said, while replying to a discussion on the Motion of Thanks to the Governor’s address in the Assembly on Tuesday evening.
He also spoke about reduction in devolution of funds from the Centre, an issue on which other states in the South have been raising the heat. The Congress-led Karnataka government and LDF-led Kerala ministry are holding protests in Delhi over the issue, and Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin has extended his support to them.Advertisement
The BJP and TDP are seen inching towards an alliance which the TDP has long been keen on, with their common friend Jana Sena Party acting as the go-between. On Wednesday, TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu, who is facing four cases and is out on bail, was scheduled to meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Delhi.
The BJP has been holding out on finalising the tie-up, reportedly because it is weighing the merits and demerits of aligning with the TDP as compared to the YSRCP. Jagan has consciously maintained “friendly” relations with the Modi government through its tenure.
The YSRCP CM has been talking of a repeat landslide, and pushing party leaders and cadre as he targets all 175 Assembly seats.
Expressing frustration at Andhra not getting the special status, which was promised by the then UPA government at the time of its bifurcation to create Telangana in 2014, Jagan said in his speech in the Assembly that the state did not have the option to fight for the status legally. “The least I wish is for a favourable government at the Centre.”Advertisement
Referring to devolution of funds to states, he said: “Braving the odds of reduction in devolution of Central funds and reduced tax revenues during the last five years due to several reasons, including the Covid-19 pandemic, that resulted in a Rs 66,116 crore revenue loss, the government has excelled in fiscal discipline, debt management, planning and the implementation of a slew of welfare schemes transparently.”
Attacking Naidu, Jagan said the TDP chief’s promises to people are picked up from election manifestos of winning parties in other states. Claiming that his government has fulfilled its promises in comparison, he said the YSRCP will sweep the elections again and introduce a full-fledged Budget after three months.",politics
Decode Politics: Modi govt’s last move for this House is a white paper on ‘economy under it vs UPA’. So what are white papers?,"The government has extended the ongoing Budget Session of Parliament by a day amid speculations that it is planning to present a “white paper” on the economy. While the government has refused to specify the agenda, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to use the extra day to present a ‘white paper’ highlighting the country’s “poor economic condition” when the Congress-led UPA left power and how the Narendra Modi government, as per its claims, has turned it around.
What is a white paper?
A white paper at its essence is a bid to break down a complex issue into simple terms and to present the issuing body’s intent on the matter. Apart from governments, a white paper is often used by businesses and other agencies to showcase their products and promote them.
One of the earliest instances of a government presenting a white paper is of 1922, when then British Prime Minister Winston Churchill introduced one to detail his government’s policy on Palestine following the riots that broke out in the Jaffa region.
How often do governments table white papers?Advertisement
The Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Lok Sabha contain no specific guidelines on the issue or tabling of white papers. There are also no guidelines to govern how often a government is required to present a white paper. Similarly, there are no specific guidelines on the subject on which white papers are meant to be issued. The government can choose to issue or table white papers on any subject it deems fit, at any given point of time during its tenure.

Can the Opposition demand a white paper?
The Opposition is well within its right to demand a white paper from the government on issues which it needs clarity on, as it has done often in the recent past. On Tuesday as well, Opposition MPs in the Rajya Sabha demanded that the government table a white paper on recovery of black money, an issue on which it has been very aggressive. “The Panama and Pandora Papers revealed the names of thousands of rich Indians who had parked black money in different tax havens. I demand a white paper from the government on this issue. No more empty promises, let the people know,” Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Md Nadimul Haque said during his address on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address.
In April last year, following former Jammu and Kashmir governor Satyapal Malik’s claims regarding the Pulwama attack, the Congress had demanded a white paper on the incident. In May, it demanded one on the government’s decision to withdraw Rs 2,000 currency notes as well as on the 2016 demonetisation move.Advertisement
The following month, the Congress sought white papers on the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) – the unofficial boundary between India and China – following reports of frequent skirmishes between the troops of the two countries. “As a responsible Opposition, we demand that a white paper be issued on the truth of the developments that have happened on the LAC in the last three years,” Congress MP Manish Tewari said.
There have also been demands on white papers related to centrally sponsored schemes, agriculture, implementation of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, the 2013 Uttarakhand floods and the health of the banking sector, at various times during the NDA government’s 10-year tenure.
Has the Modi government issued white papers?
Despite the frequent demands from the Opposition, the NDA government under Modi has tabled only two white papers so far – on the Railways in August 2014 which detailed its dynamic revenue earning model, freight and fare rationalisation, and capacity augmentation.

Do state Assemblies also see white papers?Advertisement
White papers can be demanded and tabled in state Assemblies too. Most recently, the A Revanth Reddy-led Telangana government issued a white paper on the previous Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) government’s finances and claimed that the state’s debt had increased from Rs 72,600 crore to over Rs 6 lakh crore.
In July last year, the Opposition BJP in Chhattisgarh demanded a white paper on the state government’s paddy procurement from farmers.
In November 2023, the BJP demanded a white paper on the state’s finances from the Congress-led Karnataka government.
In Maharashtra, there was a demand for a white paper on castes falling under the OBC category, while in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress demanded one on the investments the state was getting.",politics
"BJP claims big gains in TN as ex-MLAs, former MP join party; but most of them seen as spent forces","An EX-DMK MP and 15 former Tamil Nadu MLAs joined the BJP in New Delhi on Wednesday, in a move that is expected to bolster the party in the state. The 15 former MLAs who crossed sides earlier belonged to the AIADMK, DMK, Congress and the Vaiko-led DMDK.
The 16 leaders joined the BJP in the presence of Union ministers Rajeev Chandrasekhar and L Murugan, and Tamil Nadu party president K Annamalai.
“Some of them have been in politics for the last 50 years; some were part of their former parties when they were founded in Tamil Nadu. Today, they have all come to the headquarters in New Delhi to join the BJP and take the blessings of party president J P Nadda. This is the first time in Tamil Nadu that 16 senior people have joined the party at the same time. Two former MLAs had also joined during the ‘En Mann En Makkal’ yatra,” Annamalai said. The yatra criss-crossing the state was led by him.Advertisement
The former AIADMK MLAs who joined the BJP on Wednesday are K Vadivel (Karur), Challenger Duraisamy (Coimbatore), P S Kandhasamy (Aravakurichi), M V Rathinam (Pollachi), R Chinnasamy (Singanallur), V R Jayaraman (Theni), S M Vasan (Vedasanthur), P S Arul (Bhuvanagiri), R Rajendran (Kaatumannarkoil), Selvi Murugesan (Kangeyam) and A Rokini (Kolathur), apart from ex-AIADMK minister Gomathi Srinivasan.
From the DMK, former Chidambaram MP V Kulandaivelu and ex-MLA S Gurunathan (Palayamkottai) also switched camps, as did former Congress MLA R Thangaraju, who got elected from Andimatam in 1991, and former DMDK MLA K Tamilagan, who got elected from Thittakudi constituency in 2011.

After receiving their party cards from Chandrasekhar, the leaders raised slogans like “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” and “Modi ji Zindabad”.
Annamalai said it was a great occasion for the Tamil Nadu BJP, as leaders who had seen the country developing under the years of the Modi government had decided to join the party.
However, back home, the leaders who joined the BJP Wednesday are seen as old-timers not holding much stakes currently. Some of them served as legislators during 1970-1984 when M G Ramachandran, the founder of the AIADMK, was the Tamil Nadu CM. The lone former MP, V Kulandaivelu of the DMK, was last elected in 1980.
In fact, the joining did not draw even a reaction from their former parties.Advertisement
Responding to a question on Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s recent statement that all options were open, and whether that meant the BJP would patch up with the AIADMK again, Annamalai said Shah had always maintained that anyone who wants to “strengthen the hands of PM Modi” was welcome, and that his remarks were not specific to the AIADMK alone.
“The shape and form of the alliance will be announced in the coming days. We are only in the first week of February, there is still time left. Anyone can join the NDA after accepting PM Modi’s leadership. We are not going to force anyone, many parties are in talks with us,” he said.",politics
PM Modi quotes Nehru’s letter to CMs to say Congress against reservations. What did Nehru write?,"In his last address to Parliament before the Lok Sabha polls, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hit out at the Congress yet again, this time sharpening his attack on the party’s stance on caste.
Replying to the debate on the Motion of Thanks in the Rajya Sabha, Modi said: “The Congress which never gave complete reservation to OBCs, never gave reservation to the poor of the general category, which did not consider Babasaheb Ambedkar worthy of Bharat Ratna, kept giving Bharat Ratna only to its family… they are now preaching and teaching us the lesson of social justice.”

He proceeded to read out a letter by Jawaharlal Nehru as PM to state CMs of the time, saying: “I am reading out its translation — ‘I dislike any kind of reservation, more particularly in services. I am strongly against anything which leads to inefficiency and second rate standards…’. That is why I say that they (the Congress) are against it (reservation) by birth… Had the government recruited at that time and promoted them from time to time, they would have been here today.”Advertisement
What was the context of Nehru’s letter, and what did he write?
Nehru started writing to the heads of provincial governments, and later chief ministers of various states, on October 15, 1947, two months after Independence. He continued the practice till December 21, 1963, four months before his death.
These letters showcased Nehru’s political ideas and covered a range of topics, from citizenship and democracy to international relations.
In a letter dated June 27, 1961, as per the compilation of Nehru’s letters to CMs edited by legal scholar Madhav Khosla, the former PM spoke of reservations.
At this time, Article 334 of the Constitution, formulated in 1950, granted reservations in the Lok Sabha and State Legislatures to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and the Anglo-Indian community for a period of 10 years. The Article was subsequently amended in 1969, 1980, 1989, 1999. As it stands now, reservations have been extended for 80 years to SC/ST communities and 70 years for the Anglo-Indian community .Advertisement
In the letter, Nehru starts off by talking about “getting out of the old habit of reservations and particular privileges being given to this caste or that group”.
Read  | PM Modi says Nehru, Indira had a low opinion of Indians: Which speeches was he referring to, what did the former PMs say?
He added that a recent meeting of the CMs had “laid down that help should be given on economic considerations and not on caste”, and proceeded to say: “It is true that we are tied up with certain rules and conventions about helping the Scheduled Castes and Tribes. They deserve help but, even so, I dislike any kind of reservation, more particularly in Services. I react strongly against anything which leads to inefficiency and second-rate standards. I want my country to be a first class country in everything. The moment we encourage the second-rate, we are lost.”
Nehru then argued that “the only real way to help a backward group is to give opportunities of good education” , especially “technical education”, and said, “everything else is provision of some kind of crutches, which do not add to the strength or health of the body”.
Nehru said the Congress government had made two decisions in that regard: universal free elementary education, and scholarships. “I lay stress on the bright and able boys and girls because it is only they who will raise our standards. I have no doubt that there is a vast reservoir of potential talent in this country, if only we can give it opportunity. But if we go in for reservations on communal and caste basis, we swamp the bright and able people and remain second-rate or third-rate,” he said.Advertisement
“ I am grieved to learn of how far this business of reservation has gone based on communal considerations. It has amazed me to learn that even promotions are based sometimes on communal or caste considerations. This way lies not only folly, but disaster. Let us help the backward groups by all means, but never at the cost of efficiency,” he concluded.",politics
"Court notice to Kejriwal now in tussle with ED, here is the length and breadth of net around AAP","A Delhi court on Wednesday asked Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to appear before it on February 17, on a complaint filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against the Aam Aadmi Party supremo for missing five consecutive summons in relation to the liquor excise policy case.
A day earlier, premises linked to several Aam Aadmi Party leaders, including one of the closest and oldest aides of Arvind Kejriwal, were raided in a further expansion of the ambit of investigations against the embattled party.
Tuesday’s raids by the CBI, which the AAP has claimed lasted “23 hours”, were carried out in connection with alleged illegal monetary gains to a private company for the supply, installation, testing and commissioning of water meters by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB).Advertisement
The raids were conducted the same day as the ED threatened legal action against AAP leader and minister Atishi for claiming lacunae in the ED’s investigation into the liquor policy case, which has seen the arrest of several senior leaders, including former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia.
The tightening net around the AAP incidentally seems to hew close to a BJP timeline, as reported by The Indian Express, of a “400-day plan” by the party – leading up to the Lok Sabha elections and continuing till the 2025 Delhi Assembly polls – against the AAP, centred around “10 specific allegations of corruption in government departments”. These included the liquor policy case, DJB allegations, charges regarding maintenance of public buses, and alleged corruption in the construction of classrooms.
Probes are now on in all the above cases, with a majority of them starting out as police complaints or inquiries by bodies such as the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Branch (which come under the Lieutenant Governor and hence the Centre’s purview), before landing on the desks of central investigation agencies.
A line-up of the cases against the party and its leaders:Advertisement
The excise policy case and Kejriwal
The biggest albatross around the AAP’s neck is the liquor case, in which the ED has issued five summons against its supremo and Delhi CM. Kejriwal has appeared in none – mainly on the ground that he wanted to know whether he was being summoned as an accused or a witness.
The AAP has frequently claimed that the ED’s main purpose is to arrest Kejriwal – the belief further strengthened following the arrest of JMM leader Hemant Soren in Jharkhand – and declared that he would run the government from behind bars if held.
The investigation into the case began in July 2022. Two months later, the AAP government withdrew its new excise policy, but the case continued.
This is the only case so far in which Kejriwal has been questioned by the CBI and sought by the ED, though there are a slew of complaints related to various government departments and bodies naming him and demanding action against him.Advertisement
Delhi Jal Board (DJB)
The CBI is investigating whether illegal monetary gains amounting to almost Rs 40 crore were made by officials of the DJB (a department that falls under the Delhi government) in the installation of meters meant to regulate the flow of water.
The case was lodged by the CBI in 2022. Last week, the ED, which is looking into the money laundering angle of the investigation, arrested retired DJB chief engineer Jagdish Kumar Arora and others in connection with the alleged scam.
On Tuesday, the AAP leaders raided in the case included its Treasurer and Rajya Sabha MP N D Gupta and Kejriwal’s personal secretary and confidant Bibhav Kumar.
Case against Atishi
If the ED pursues the legal route against her over the charges she has made against the agency, Atishi, who now holds the maximum portfolios in the Kejriwal government – like Sisodia once did – will become the fourth person from the seven-member AAP Delhi government to have legal proceedings launched against her by a central agency.Advertisement
Earlier, Satyendar Jain and Sisodia stepped down as ministers following their arrest.
The legal notice to Atishi followed her claims that the ED has failed to recover any allegedly laundered money in its many raids and detained individuals without evidence. She also questioned the witness statements submitted by the ED to courts in the liquor policy case.
Earlier, a legal notice was served by the Delhi Police to Atishi, as well as Kejriwal, over their allegations that the BJP was trying to poach AAP leaders.
Of the serving ministers, in addition to Kejriwal, Kailash Gahlot and Raaj Kumar Anand are facing inquiries by central agencies.Advertisement
Several other AAP leaders too are facing investigation by central agencies, while its Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is behind bars.
AAP’s arrested leaders
Then the Delhi Power Minister, Satyendar Jain has been under ED arrest since May 2022, in an alleged money laundering case based on a 2017 CBI FIR against him. He is accused of having laundered money through four companies allegedly linked to him.
Sisodia, then the Delhi Deputy CM and the Excise Minister when the new liquor policy was implemented, has been in jail since February 2023. He was arrested by the CBI and then by the ED, and accused of extra-procedural interference in framing the new policy, tweaking it for the benefit of select liquor entities, and causing loss of several hundred crores to the state exchequer in excise revenue.
Besides, Sisodia is being prosecuted by the CBI in an alleged corruption case related to a short-lived ‘Feed Back Unit’ dating back to 2015 – described by a Delhi Vigilance Department report as an “extra-constitutional, extra-judicial Intelligence Agency” manned by retired intelligence, police and paramilitary officials to gather “actionable feedback” on the goings-on in government departments and “trap” them.Advertisement
In September 2022, AAP communications in-charge Vijay Nair was arrested by the CBI, and later by the ED, for his alleged role as a middleman between the ‘South Group’ – which allegedly gave Rs 100 crore as kickbacks to enter the liquor retail segment in the Capital – and the AAP. He is also accused of laundering money received as kickbacks for the AAP’s Goa Assembly poll campaign.
Sanjay Singh, accused of being “a key conspirator” in the liquor policy case and having “exploited and gained illegal money / kickbacks” from liquor groups, was arrested by the ED in October 2023.
Ongoing inquiries
The CBI is investigating a complaint of alleged irregularities in the tendering and bidding process for 1,000 buses procured by the Delhi government, as well as their maintenance, against Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot.
In November last year, Delhi Social Welfare and Labour Minister Raaj Kumar Anand’s residence was raided by the ED in relation to alleged money laundering. This was after the filing of a chargesheet by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence on charges of false declarations in imports from China leading to Customs evasion of more than Rs 7 crore, besides international hawala transactions.",politics
"Uttarakhand set to pass UCC, numbers show a BJP on rise in the state but Congress holding on","On Tuesday, the Uttarakhand government tabled the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill in the state Assembly during a special four-day session, nearly two years after a committee was formed to draft the Bill. With the Bill set to be passed by the state Assembly, Uttarakhand will become the first state since Independence to institute a UCC (Goa has had one since it was a Portuguese territory).
The UCC, which seeks to bring uniformity in laws governing marriage, divorce, and inheritance, among other things, across religions, however, has faced criticism from Opposition parties and the Muslim community.
The committee that drafted the Bill claims to have held 72 meetings, interacted with around 10,000 people and received 2.3 lakh suggestions from the public, including meetings in areas with large Muslim populations such as Kaliyar Sharif, Manglaur, Ramnagar, Haldwani, Kashipur and Vikas Nagar.Advertisement
Though Hindus make up an overwhelming majority of Uttarakhand’s population at 82.97% of the population, Muslims account for a substantial 13.95% as well, as per the 2011 Census. The districts with the highest proportion of Muslims are Haridwar (34.28%), Udham Singh Nagar (22.58%), Nainital (12.65%) and Dehradun (11.91%).
In the state’s remaining nine districts, the Muslim population ranges from 0.55% to 3.35%.
The four districts with the largest Muslim populations together have 36 Assembly seats, and are primarily represented in the Lok Sabha seats of Hardwar, Nainital-Udham Singh Nagar and Tehri Garhwal. The BJP has won all the five Lok Sabha in Uttarakhand in the last two elections. However, in terms of vote share, the Congress is not too far behind in the state’s bipolar politics.
Explained | Hits and misses of Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code: What the Bill does, and does not do
In the 2022 Assembly elections, which the BJP won to return to power, its sitting CM Pushkar Singh Dhami had promised a UCC on the last day of campaigning. Incidentally, Dhami himself lost, though his success in piloting the UCC Bill now firmly entrenches its position. A UCC is one of the oldest agendas of the Sangh – long before Ram Temple – and has featured in the BJP election manifesto since 1989.Advertisement
So, with the Lok Sabha elections months away, could the UCC change the poll equations? A look at the numbers:
Lok Sabha
Since Uttarakhand was carved out of Uttar Pradesh in 2002, the state has seen four Lok Sabha elections, of which only the first one saw the 5 seats divided among parties (3 to the BJP, and 1 each to the Congress and Samajwadi Party). In 2009, the Congress swept all the five seats, while in 2014 and 2019 (the two Modi wave elections), it was the BJP that bagged all.
In terms of vote share too, the BJP has consistently been on the rise since 2009. While the Congress’s share has declined, in the largely bipolar contest, it still gets 30-plus percentage votes. Similarly, though parties like the BSP, Aam Aadmi Party and SP have had limited success, the BSP has held on to a base vote of around 5%.
 Vote shares in Lok Sabha polls
The BJP has also done well in the recent past in the three seats that have sizeable Muslim populations – Hardwar, Nainital-Udham Singh Nagar and Tehri Garhwal. Its candidates secured more than 60% of the vote share in two seats and more than 50% in the other seat in the 2019 polls. In the 2014 polls, the BJP won more than 50% of the vote share in each of these seats.Advertisement
In 2009, when it won all the 5 seats, the Congress won these 3 with just over 40% of the votes.

In 2004, the SP had won Hardwar with 32.3% of the votes, with the BSP and BJP close behind. The Congress had won Nainital comfortably, but had lost out to the BJP in Tehri Garhwal by just over 17,000 votes.
Assembly polls
The BJP has dominated the state polls in Uttarakhand, forming the government after three of the five elections held since the state was created. The polls have primarily been bipolar contests, with the BSP a third contender.
The last two Assembly polls, in 2017 and 2022, saw the BJP win comfortably, with more than 40% of the votes and a clear lead ahead of the majority mark of 36 in the 70-member House.Advertisement
However, the state’s first three elections were more competitive, with the BJP and Congress ending in a near tie in 2012.
 Seats won in Assembly polls
While the BJP won 47 seats and 44.33% of the votes in 2022, it recorded the state’s highest seat tally and vote share in 2017, at 56 and 46.51%, respectively.
In 2012 and 2007, no party won an outright majority, with a narrow vote share margin separating the BJP and the Congress. In 2012, the Congress, with 32 seats, won just one more seat than the BJP and secured a vote share of 33.79%, which was just 0.66%-points higher than the BJP’s. That year the Congress ended up forming the government with a post-poll alliance with the BSP, Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (UKD) and Independents.
 Vote share in Assembly polls
In 2007, the BJP fell short of the majority mark by just one seat. The Congress was far behind the BJP in terms of sets with 21, but its 29.59% vote share was just 2.31%-points behind the BJP’s 31.9%. The BJP went on to form the government with the UKD and Independents.Advertisement
The 2002 poll, the state’s first, was the Congress’s only win with an outright majority. The party won 36 seats and 26.91% of the vote. While the BJP won 19 seats, its vote share at 25.45% was just 1.46%-points behind the Congress.
In the 36 Assembly seats that fall in the districts with sizeable Muslim populations, the BJP won 21 seats, Congress 12, BSP 2 and Independents 1 in the 2022 Assembly polls. In 2017, the BJP had won 29 of these seats, with the Congress winning just 6. In 2012, it was a narrower contest – the BJP had won 19 seats and the Congress 14 with the BSP taking 3.",politics
"The latest Opposition leader under ED watch, Harak Rawat, is a frequent side shifter, was last in BJP","Uttarakhand Congress leader Harak Singh Rawat, who was with the BJP till January 2022 and served as a minister in the previous government of the party, is the latest Opposition leader to come under the Enforcement Directorate’s radar.
On Wednesday, the central agency conducted raids at several locations in Delhi, Uttarakhand and Chandigarh in connection with a forest scam allegedly linked to Rawat.
The ED claims that under Rawat’s watch as Uttarakhand forest minister, thousands of trees were felled in the state. It alleges financial irregularities in his dealings, and illegal construction in the Pakhro Tiger Reserve range of the Corbett National Park in 2019.  Advertisement
Rawat’s career of over 30 years started off with the BJP. His first Assembly election was in 1991 from the Pauri seat. He also went on to become a minister in the Kalyan Singh government of then undivided Uttar Pradesh and was among the youngest ministers in the government of the time. 
In 1998, he joined the Bahujan Samaj Party. He made another switch in 2022, to the Congress, when the BSP denied him a ticket. He won the Lansdowne seat in the Assembly polls that year. He served as the Leader of the Opposition between 2007-12 when the BJP’s B C Khanduri was CM.
In 2012, Rawat lost to Vijay Bahuguna in the race to the CM post but was inducted in the Cabinet.
Four years later, Rawat, miffed with not being allotted crucial departments such as Power and Public Works, was among the nine Congress legislators who in 2016 joined hands with the BJP to dislodge then Chief Minister Harish Rawat’s government.Advertisement
In January 2022 though, the Uttarakhand BJP removed Rawat from the party for six years, citing indiscipline. The action came a month after Rawat, who was the Minister for Forests and Environment, Labour, Employment and Skill Development, threatened to resign from the post during a Cabinet meeting chaired by then and current CM Pushkar Singh Dhami.
Five days after being removed from the BJP, Rawat joined the Congress along with his daughter-in-law Anukriti Gusain. The Congress party put up a united front and ensured the presence of its entire Uttarakhand line-up in Delhi to welcome Rawat.
While the senior leader hoped to start afresh in the Congress, his removal from the BJP is said to have significantly reduced his bargaining power. As a result, Harak had to choose between himself and his daughter-in-law for a ticket in the 2022 Assembly polls. Anukriti contested from the Lansdowne seat but lost to the BJP’s Daleep Singh Rawat.
Harak was later accommodated by the All-India Congress Committee (AICC) as the coordinator for the 2023 Rajasthan Assembly Elections.",politics
Ram temple resolution and invite put SP MLAs in a spot as cracks appear,"A resolution passed by the Uttar Pradesh Assembly thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for the Ram Temple consecration ceremony in Ayodhya last month seems to have exposed the divide within the opposition Samajwadi Party (SP).
While a section of SP leaders questioned the ruling BJP’s decision to bring in the resolution, others vocally came out in support of it.
Adding to it, Assembly Speaker Satish Mahana’s invite to all the legislators on Tuesday to visit Ayodhya on February 11 for a “darshan” of Ram Temple, has put the Opposition members, especially the SP MLAs in a spot.Advertisement
Opinion | Why I should be allowed to not celebrate the Ram temple consecration in Ayodhya
On Monday evening, when the resolution thanking PM Modi and CM Adityanath was passed by in the House by a voice-vote, most of the Opposition MLAs nodded their heads approvingly. According to the Speaker, only 14 MLAs voted against the resolution.
There were more than three dozen SP MLAs in the House at the time of the vote, sources said. Notably, the SP, which is the largest Opposition party in the Assembly has over 100 MLAs.
The SP leadership had also not issued any whip or statement to its legislators on the resolution.
On Tuesday, when the House met again, SP MLA Swami Omvesh told the House that he did not oppose the resolution. Speaking on the floor of the House during Question Hour, Omvesh urged the Speaker to rectify the records if it was mentioned that he had opposed the resolution. “Prabhu Shri Ram ke charano mein naman karta hun. Kal maine samarthan mein hath uthaya tha… Mere saath jyati hui hai… Main rojana Shri Ram ka nara lagata hun (Every day, I chant Lord Shri Ram’s name and chant the slogan… I had raised my hand yesterday in support of the resolution… I have been wronged),” the SP MLA said.Advertisement
A section of SP legislators, however, said the Ram Temple in Ayodhya has been constructed on the orders of the Supreme Court and therefore the UP Assembly should not have passed the resolution thanking PM Modi and CM Adityanath for the consecration ceremony.

Later in the day, after Speaker Mahana announced in the House that all the members were invited to visit “Ayodhya Dham”, SP MLA from Sambhal, Iqbal Mahmood, said that if the Speaker was taking all the members to Ayodhya for Ram Temple visit, then all the legislators should also be taken to the place where a mosque is to be built on the orders of the Supreme Court in the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi verdict.
“Supreme Court ne hi masjid ke liye bhi jagah di hai. Sadhbhavna ki baat hai. Saath saath masjid ki jagah bhi visit ho jaaye (The Supreme Court had allotted land for the construction of the mosque in Ayodhya. For communal harmony, legislators can also be taken to the place where the mosque is to be built),” MLA Mahmood said.
While inviting all the members to Ayodhya, Mahana said that he had read senior SP leader Shivpal Singh Yadav’s remark that if the Speaker would take MLAs to Ram Temple, he would join them.Advertisement
“Jo bhi Ayodhya Dham ke darshan karna chahte hain, sabhi ek saath.. Ek message jayega… Kisi ke liye koi forcible nahi hai (Whoever wants to visit Ayodhya Dham with everyone… a message will go to people…. But no one is forced to join),” said Mahana.
SP president Akhilesh Yadav, who last month had received the invite to attend the January 22 Ram temple opening ceremony, had then said that he would visit the temple with his family after the consecration ceremony. “I will definitely come after the ceremony with my family as worshippers,” he had tweeted.",politics
"Decode Politics: Why there is talk of a southern alliance amid Karnataka, Kerala govts’ Delhi protests","Opposition-ruled states, especially those from the south, have over the years complained about the Union government’s tax devolution policies and losing out on tax revenue. Now, they are set to hit the streets of Delhi in protest on Wednesday and there is talk about the southern states forming an alliance to seek their “rightful share” in taxes devolved by the Centre and protest against alleged disparities in allocation of Central funds.
The Karnataka government will protest in Delhi on Wednesday, followed by a Kerala Cabinet protest in the national Capital on Thursday.
What is the southern alliance?
Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s economic advisor Basavaraj Rayareddy has talked of the southern states floating an alliance that will serve as a forum from which they can articulate their position before the 16th Finance Commission. Karnataka is looking to mount pressure on the Commission to address the issue of the “significant reduction” in its revenue under the 15th Commission. Starting Sunday, Siddaramaiah and several Karnataka Congress leaders have taken to social media posting several posts on X with the hashtag #SouthTaxMovement.Advertisement
Rayareddy told The Indian Express that the alliance would materialise only after the Lok Sabha elections. “The chief minister says it will be discussed at the party forum before going further. So, we will have to talk with the local Congress unit in Kerala. There will not be any problem in Tamil Nadu,” he said, adding they were yet to figure out how to rope in Andhra Pradesh where the YSR Congress Party of Jagan Mohan Reddy is in power.
Rayareddy said the 16th Finance Commission would submit its recommendations on October 31, 2025. “There is a lot of time still (for the alliance),” he added.
On Tuesday, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin wrote to Pinarayi Vijayan backing the Kerala government’s efforts to uphold the principles of fiscal federalism and appreciating it for moving the Supreme Court against the Centre. Central to his argument and that of Kerala is the allegation that the Centre has been exploiting its powers under Article 293 of the Constitution to severely limit the borrowing capacity of states.
Why is Karnataka protesting?
After the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission came into force, Karnataka saw its share of taxes from the central pool drop from 4.71% to 3.64%. The state government has claimed that the reduction is a “punishment” for ensuring better standards of living in comparison to states in the north.Advertisement
The Karnataka government is also protesting against the disparity in allocating funds to the state by the Centre. Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar, other ministers, and party legislators are also scheduled to participate in the sit-in at Jantar Mantar.
Siddaramaiah has also written to all Union Ministers and MPs from the state seeking their support and participation in the protest. This includes Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, her Cabinet colleagues Pralhad Joshi and A Narayanaswamy, and the Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge.
What is the shortage of funds in Karnataka?
Siddaramaiah told reporters in Bengaluru on Monday that allocations from the Centre had dwindled and estimated that Karnataka would lose out on almost Rs 1.87 lakh crore because of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the implementation of the 15th Finance Commission’s recommendations.
The government arrived at the figure of Rs 1.87 lakh crore by adding up the revenue shortage of Rs 59,274 crore due to GST implementation, the reduction in the state’s share of taxes as per the 15th Finance Commission that is cumulatively projected to be Rs 62,098 crore between 2020-’21 and 2025-’26, the alleged denial of the state’s share in cesses and surcharges imposed by the Centre and others amounting to Rs 55,000 crore between 2017 and 2024, and another Rs 11,495 crore recommended by the Finance Commission but rejected by the Centre. Apart from this, another Rs 5,300 crore promised in the 2022-’23 Union Budget for the Upper Bhadra lift irrigation project has also remained on paper, according to Siddaramaiah.Advertisement
Why is Kerala going to protest?
The Kerala Cabinet led by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will protest against the “neglect of the Union Government towards the state”. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) government in the state has been highly critical of the Union government for curtailing its right to borrow money for developmental activities at a time when the state is facing a financial crisis.
On February 2, the Kerala Assembly unanimously passed a resolution asking the Centre to “desist from the move to slash down the state’s borrowing limit and withhold various grants to the state”. The Pinarayi Vijayan government has moved the Supreme Court alleging that the Centre is violating fiscal federalism and will prevent it from fulfilling commitments made in its annual budgets.
What is Kerala’s financial situation?
Kerala says the Centre has curtailed Rs 57,400 crore in state receipts and there is a shortfall of Rs 12,000 crore due to the cessation of GST compensation and a Rs 8,400 crore shortfall in this year’s Revenue Deficit Grant. The state’s revenue from the central pool has fallen by Rs 18,000 crore because of a reduction in its share from 3.87% to 1.92% between the tenures of the 10th and 15th finance panels. As per the Centre’s guidelines, Kerala’s borrowing limit is Rs 39,626 crore. The state Budget was prepared using that figure but the state gpverm,emt has been allowed to borrow only Rs 28,830 crore till now. The borrowing limit was cut short mid-fiscal without any prior notice, according to the state government.
What is the Centre’s position?
Nirmala Sitharaman told the Lok Sabha on Monday that the devolution of taxes was based on the recommendations of the Finance Commission and that she had no discretionary powers. The Union Finance Minister said 100% of state GST was transferred automatically to the states and roughly 50% of the integrated GST was shared with the states and periodically readjusted to actuals.Advertisement
In a note to the Supreme Court in the case filed by the Kerala government, the Union government blamed the state’s financial woes on its “poor public financial management”. The Centre told the court that Kerala had been allotted substantial resources from central taxes and duties, the highest share of post-devolution Revenue Deficit Grant, financial support over and above the Finance Commission’s proposals, and substantial transfer of resources under centrally sponsored schemes.

"Decode Politics: How BJP has gone slowly, steadily about a UCC, one of Sangh’s first core agendas","With Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami tabling the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill in the state Assembly Tuesday, the BJP has taken a step towards fulfilling its third and last core ideological agenda, which has been central to its belief system since its Jana Sangh days.
In fact, the UCC and the abrogation of Article 370 – which the party implemented immediately after it returned to power with a higher seat tally after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls – precede every other agenda of the party. These were endorsed as the party’s guiding principles and core policies on October 21, 1951, when around 200 delegates assembled in the forecourt of the Arya Kanya Vidyalaya in New Delhi, where the Bharatiya Jan Sangh (BJS), the predecessor of the BJP, was born. The Ram temple, on the other hand, entered the BJP’s agenda book only at the 1989 Palampur National Executive meeting.
Once the UCC becomes a reality in Uttarakhand, two other BJP-ruled states, Gujarat and Assam, will follow suit – both the state governments are expected to introduce more or less the same Bill.Advertisement
In Uttarakhand, Dhami had unveiled the introduction of the UCC as a poll promise right on the eve of the February 2022 Assembly elections, saying the “security” of the state’s cultural and religious heritage as well as its borders was important for the country.

The party had returned to power with a thumping majority – 47 of 70 seats.
How is the BJP framing the UCC issue?
The ideologues in the party argue that the UCC is not a populist measure, but rather “a modern approach to civil rights”. Says R Balashankar, former editor of RSS affiliate The Organiser: “For the BJP, it has been part of its core agenda from the Jana Sangh days. This is not for catching votes, nor is it a populist measure, but it is with the idea of integrating the country as one nation with one law, in civil matters like inheritance, marriage, women rights and sharing of family property… It’s a modern approach to civil rights.”
Suggestions for a UCC have earlier drawn protests from a section of not just Muslims, Sikhs and other minorities but also Hindus, who fear interference in their customs. Some argue that a UCC violates the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution, including Article 25 (freedom to profess and practise one’s religion) and Article 29 (right to have a distinct culture) as well as the concept of unity in diversity. Minority groups term it as a flexing of majoritarianism and argue that it would affect minorities adversely as they would not be able to protect their identity, customs and practices.Advertisement

But when he made the first public push of his government for the UCC last June in Bhopal, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also centred his argument around “constitutional equality” and “gender justice” – the same way that he had projected his government’s move to declare instant triple talaq a criminal offence in 2019. “How can a country function with such a dual system? We must remember that the Indian Constitution also speaks of equal rights for citizens,” he had said.
However, the escalating noise around the UCC would certainly appeal to the BJP’s core constituency ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, already on a high after the Ayodhya Ram Temple consecration and the PM’s bold prediction of 370-plus seats for the party and 400-plus for the NDA. Party spin masters admit that the promise of expansion of UCC would “further consolidate” the party’s core voter base and please its hardcore supporters.
How has the BJP approached implementing the UCC?
Even with a brute majority in the Lok Sabha and its dominance in larger, more-populated states, the BJP has been careful in its approach to the UCC. The party, which faced widespread protests over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, has chosen not to take it up at the central level, instead asking party-ruled states to move towards it.
State governments in Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra also have announced that they would implement a UCC. A version of UCC has existed in BJP-ruled Goa since it was a Portuguese colony.
How often has a UCC featured in BJP manifestos?Advertisement
In its 1957 election manifesto, the Jana Sangh promised to repeal the Hindu Marriage Act and Hindu Succession Act, but was silent on the UCC. It was not part of the BJS manifesto in 1962 either.
It was ahead of the 1967 Lok Sabha polls that the BJS promised in its manifesto a “uniform law for marriage, succession and adoption for all citizens”. This was promised in 1971 too, but was missing in 1977 (when the Jana Sangh fought as part of the Janata Party coalition) and 1980 (by which time the BJP had been formed).

It was the 1985 Shah Bano case that reinvigorated the UCC demand for the BJP. After the Rajiv Gandhi government brought in a law to overturn a Supreme Court order that had given Shah Bano maintenance from the husband who had divorced her, under pressure from some Muslim groups, the BJP added UCC to its manifesto in the 1989 elections.
The demand for the UCC’s implementation would find mention in the BJP’s subsequent poll manifestos, in 1991, 1998, 2004 and 2019.Advertisement
What was the BJP view on a UCC under A B Vajpayee?
When the BJP came to power under Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1996, a government that lasted only 13 days, the party had to keep aside all the three issues of its core but contentious agenda after intense discussions in the party and its ideological parent RSS.
In his book ‘My Country, My Life’, BJP veteran L K Advani wrote that some within the party held the view that Vajpayee should have mentioned the three core issues in the emotional speech he made just before resigning after the party failed to muster enough support in the Lok Sabha. Advani, though, did not agree with this, and felt Vajpayee’s speech had enhanced the BJP’s popularity and prestige.

When a BJP-led NDA government was formed after the 1998 elections, the party had to again keep all the three commitments out of its National Agenda of Governance (NAG) to accommodate its alliance partners.Advertisement
Later, justifying the party’s decision on the NAG, Advani had said: “The BJP did not have a majority on its own, it was natural for the constituent parties to agree to keep only consensual issues in the NAG. But where does this leave the three mentioned issues that have been part of our ideological identity? Have we acted in an opportunistic and unprincipled manner?… I set out to answer them by making two points. One, a large area of governance does not have much to do with ideology – any ideology – except the overriding principle of national interests. Indeed, good governance in most spheres of national life becomes possible only when it is de-politicised. Thus if any issue, in spite of inherent validity, acquires a strong ideological character – in fact, so strong an ideological character as to make coalition governance, and hence stable governance, difficult – it is only proper to leave it out.”
Why does Uttarakhand’s UCC exclude tribal groups?
The proposed Uttarakhand UCC Bill – meant to create uniform laws applicable to all communities, on issues of marriage, inheritance, divorce, among other things – is not applicable to tribal communities.

It was the RSS that called for this concession for indigenous communities and their practices. The Sangh, which has been working in tribal areas intensely, had sensed the vehement opposition from tribal communities against a UCC. Tribal-dominated Mizoram and Nagaland have already passed unanimous resolutions in their Assemblies against any move to implement a UCC.
At a time when the BJP is working hard to keep its tribal votes intact – which is crucial for the party in a number of Hindi heartland states, and also Gujarat – it does not want to upset the community.",politics
What next for Sharad Pawar? Choosing a new party name and symbol immediate task,"Minutes after the Election Commission (EC) on Tuesday announced that the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) name and its clock symbol would go to the Ajit Pawar-led group, the Sharad Pawar faction said the veteran leader would announce his outfit’s name and symbol on Wednesday. The group also said it would also approach the Supreme Court against the poll panel’s decision.
Sources in Pawar’s party said the new name was likely to retain the words “Nationalist” and “Congress”. The “rising sun”, “wheel”, and “tractor” were among the options for the party’s new symbol. The EC in its order asked the Pawar group to “claim a new name” and “provide three preferences” by Wednesday 4 pm since Rajya Sabha elections to six seats from Maharashtra are scheduled for February 27.
“The EC has asked us to decide a new name and the party for the coming Rajya Sabha elections. We will do it tomorrow (Wednesday),” said Lok Sabha MP from Baramati Supriya Sule, who is Sharad Pawar’s daughter.Advertisement
Political Pulse | Ajit Pawar is hard-hearted, selfish and ungrateful, says Sanjay Raut after ‘last poll’ jibe at Sharad Pawar
In his six-decade political career, Pawar has contested elections on at least four different election symbols: a pair of bulls, charkha (spinning wheel), cow and calf, and hand and clock. Before founding the NCP, he was in parties such as the Congress, Congress (R), Congress (U), Congress (Socialist), and Congress (I).
As the Pawar group tries to get a new name and symbol, a battle in front of Assembly Speaker Rahul Narvekar awaits as the verdict has not yet been passed in the disqualification pleas against MLAs of both NCP groups. The hearing in the case concluded on January 31 and the judgment is expected by February 15.
“It is the victory of the invisible power. The man who founded the party has been facing defeat. But I do not find it strange. We are getting the order that was against the Shiv Sena. The same conspiracy was hatched against the Thackeray family. This is a conspiracy against Maharashtra. The decision is not at all shocking to us. Sharad Pawar raised this party from zero, we will raise it again,” Sule said, adding that the question of who the party belongs to would be settled in the Supreme Court.

Echoing Sule, the Sharad Pawar group’s state president Jayant Patil said, “The EC’s decision is shocking. We will be approaching the Supreme Court against the decision. The order proves that all constitutional organisations have lost their autonomy and the order prima facie is by merely simply putting forward some technical issues.

"Today in Politics: Chandrababu Naidu likely to visit Delhi, are talks with BJP on the cards?","With the Lok Sabha elections a handful of months away, Wednesday is set to be a busy day on the streets and in the back rooms of power in the national Capital.
First, the Karnataka government will hold a protest at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar — expected to continue from 10.30 am to 1 pm — against the Centre’s fiscal policies that it alleges discriminate against the state. Deputy CM D K Shivakumar has said the protest is a “non-partisan struggle for the benefit of Kannadigas and Karnataka” and will see Congress MLAs and MLCs also participate. However, It is not just Karnataka in protest mode. On Thursday, it will be the turn of the Pinarayi Vijayan-led Kerala government to hold a sit-in against the Union government at Jantar Mantar.
At a time when the BJP is exuding confidence about the NDA crossing the 400-seat mark in the coming parliamentary elections and the INDIA alliance has yet to wrap up seat-sharing talks — it is also struggling to hold on to its constituents — these protests will be a shot in the arm for the Opposition.Advertisement
Not surprisingly, the latest pushback against the BJP-led Centre has come from two states from South India that, except for Karnataka, the ruling party has not been able to crack yet. There is also talk emanating from Karnataka about the possibility of a southern alliance being formed so that the southern states can collectively bargain on a stronger footing before the 16th Finance Commission.
Asked about a southern alliance, Karnataka Minister Priyank Kharge told Manoj CG ahead of the protest, “Everybody is fighting for it separately, but sooner or later, it will evolve. Telangana is on a par with us because we are the same party (the Congress is also in power in the state). In Tamil Nadu, we are part of the coalition government. In Kerala, even though we are in the Opposition, we support these anti-federalism moves …”
But these two programmes and Kharge’s answer also raise questions about the Opposition’s strategy. Why are Congress-ruled Karnataka and Left-ruled Kerala — both parties are members of the INDIA bloc — holding separate protests when their broad grievances are the same? Was the Trinamool Congress (TMC) invited to the protests given that West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee too recently held a dharna in Kolkata against the Centre for allegedly withholding funds owed to the state? As election strategist-turned-activist Prashant Kishor said at last week’s Express Adda event in New Delhi, for the Opposition it is not simply a matter of parties holding the 62% anti-BJP votes coming together. “You also have to bring synergy among them in terms of narrative, grassroots effort and campaign on the ground,” Kishor said.
Will two former allies meet?
Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader Chandrababu Naidu is likely to visit Delhi on Wednesday. The buzz is that the former Andhra Pradesh CM, whose party quit the NDA ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections over the state not being given special category status, may hold talks with the top BJP leadership about returning to the NDA fold and joining hands against the YSRCP in the state.Advertisement
In context: Speculation about the TDP’s re-entry into the BJP-led alliance first started doing the rounds last June when Naidu held a late-evening meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP president J P Nadda. Following its loss in the Karnataka state elections, the BJP was said to have reopened communication channels with JD(S), TDP, and Akali Dal, former allies who had quit the alliance. Of these parties, the JD(S) is now back with the BJP. But, not sure about whether it should alienate Andhra CM Jagan Mohan Reddy whose YSCRP appears to be a stronger electoral force and had maintained cordial relations with it, the BJP in August was reported to be weighing its options.
A couple of months later, when Naidu was in prison after being arrested in a case of alleged scam, senior TDP leader and the former CM’s son Nara Lokesh met Amit Shah in Delhi. At the time too, party insiders said the BJP leadership was holding its cards close to its chest.
Decision time for Sharad Pawar
The Sharad Pawar camp of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) will announce its new name and symbol on Wednesday. This comes a day after the Election Commission (EC) ruled that the Ajit Pawar-led group had the right to call itself the NCP and use the clock symbol.
Sources told Alok Deshpande that Pawar was likely to retain the words words “Nationalist” and “Congress” in his party’s name. The “rising sun”, “wheel”, and “tractor” are among the options for its new symbol. The Pawar group has to claim a new name and “provide three preferences” by Wednesday 4 pm, as per the EC order, since Rajya Sabha elections to six seats from Maharashtra are scheduled for February 27.Advertisement
But this is just the beginning of the tussle between the two groups and will now end up in the courts. After the order was issued, the state president of Pawar’s NCP faction, Jayant Patil, said, “We will be approaching the Supreme Court against the decision. The order proves that all constitutional organisations have lost their autonomy and the order prima facie is by merely simply putting forward some technical issues. We believe that the Supreme Court will do justice.”",politics
"‘Everybody is fighting separately, but sooner or later, it (a South alliance) will evolve… We are all seeing how governors, raids being used’: Priyank KhargePremium Story","The Karnataka Minister for Rural Development, Panchayati Raj and Information Technology, Priyank Kharge speaks to The Indian Express on the state government-led protest being held in Delhi on Wednesday, and why it was forced to take the step. Excerpts:
Q) What has prompted the Delhi protest led by Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and including the entire state Cabinet?
It is nothing new what we are saying. We said this even during our previous tenure – that the Central government has been unfair to Karnataka in spite of the state being the economic powerhouse of the country, whether it is GST collection, revenues or IT (Information Technology) that we deliver. We are always in the Top 3 bracket and, yet, somehow, we get short-changed when it comes to devolution of funds and taxes, even reimbursement for that matter. We are just asking for a fair devolution and redressal of our concerns.Advertisement
Also Read | Karnataka, Kerala bring campaign against ‘financial atrocities’ of Centre to Delhi
Q) Does the state have other concerns?
See, in a federal structure, you cannot treat a state in an unfair manner only because you are not in power there. We are facing a severe drought situation. We asked for Rs 36,000 crore, out of which Rs 18,000 crore can come from the NDRF (National Disaster Response Force), and the rest we will manage… But there is zero. The Revenue Minister, Agriculture Minister and myself visited Delhi on more than three occasions seeking an appointment, but we don’t even get any appointments. I have written to the Panchayati Raj (Ministry) four-five times… there has been no response.
So we’re just asking, why this kind of treatment? And what does the drought manual say? The drought manual says that if it’s a drought-declared state, the MNREGS kicks in for 150 days instead of 100. How long do we have to beg the Central government to do that? The wages of people who have worked in the MNREGS… these have not been compensated till now. Every three months, there is a huge gap of close to around Rs 600 crore that we have to keep meeting. So if we start filling (the gap), then what is the Central government supposed to do?

Q) The state has been complaining about the devolution of funds.Advertisement
Under the 14th Finance Commission, we would get around 4.71% of the taxes. This has fallen to 3.64% in the 15th Finance Commission. So, we have incurred a loss of close to around Rs 1.87 lakh crore. And when the 15th Finance Commission has itself recommended that you deserve something… because of the loss involved in the share of devolution of taxes, the Finance Minister who is from Karnataka rejects it!
It has become a mockery. Irrigation projects… they are national projects… you have taken up the Upper Bhadra… you have not done anything. You have not given us permission for the Mekedatu project, then the Kalaburagi Railway division that Mr (Mallikarjun) Kharge envisioned, it is an economically viable project, you have not allowed it to even take off. You have kept Rs 1,000 for it. Is it not a mockery? Rs 1,000 for a railway division… We are not a BIMARU state, we are an economic powerhouse. Imagine how we feel when for every Rs 100 that we pay, Rs 13 comes back to us and Uttar Pradesh gets Rs 333.
Q) But the formula for devolution of taxes is devised by the Finance Commission.
So how is it that Madhya Pradesh is getting Rs 279, UP is getting Rs 333…Advertisement

Q) So you want a new formula to be devised?
We have already written to the government about what the 16th Finance Commission needs to do… We contribute so much and we get only Rs 44,485 crore, whereas UP gets Rs 2.18 lakh crore, MP Rs 95,000 crore.
Q) Your protest is happening just before the Lok Sabha elections.
When they (the BJP) inaugurated an incomplete Ram Mandir, which the Shankaracharyas were against… nobody asked such questions. But if we fight for our rights, people have a problem with it. Now is the time. The financial year is ending. We are presenting a budget. The Centre has presented a Budget (interim budget). The 16th Finance Commission is being looked at.Advertisement
Q) At the same time, Congress leaders are saying there is no point in electing BJP MPs as they won’t take on the Central government. So isn’t it all electoral?
We have been saying that they (the BJP MPs) are spineless. We said that during previous elections as well. It is not that we are going to do a flash protest. We have been writing to the government, without a response. We have been coming to Delhi and knocking at their doors, but no response. What else do you expect us to do when the diplomatic channels have failed? When I am not able to talk to my own minister in the Central government… or the Central government ministers do not have time for us?

Q) Congress Lok Sabha MP D K Suresh said the South might have to seek a separate country (the party later criticised the statement). On Thursday, the Kerala government is holding a similar protest as yours. Do you see a South alliance taking shape?
It is not just us. Every state following good governance is being punished, instead of being rewarded… In a federal structure… we have no problems sharing. That is what we need to do, but you cannot overfeed somebody and underfeed somebody to the tune that progress just drops off and you become malnourished while trying to nourish somebody else. What policies are you evolving to ensure that we stay nourished?Advertisement
Q) So do you see a South alliance taking shape?
Everybody is fighting for it separately, but sooner or later, it will evolve. Telangana is on a par with us because we are the same party (the Congress is also in power in the state). In Tamil Nadu, we are part of the coalition government. In Kerala, even though we are in the Opposition, we support these anti-federalism moves – how governors are being used as tools in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and partially in Karnataka; how come you never hear anything from Odisha and Andhra Pradesh; why there are no IT raids, no ED raids, no CBI, nothing (there).
Q) What is your realistic assessment of the Congress’s chances in Karnataka in the Lok Sabha elections?
We should pull it off. There is no excuse for not pulling it off. We will reach anywhere between 18 and 20.Advertisement
Q) The BJP has tied up with the JD(S) in Karnataka. The perception is that there could be a Vokkaliga-Lingayat consolidation behind the coalition.
The JD(S) is a politically dead horse. The BJP is trying to flog it to run. Nothing is going to happen. They (the JD-S) do not have people either. It is extremely limited to the brothers (H D Deve Gowda’s sons). As we get closer to elections, you will see it disintegrate even more.",politics
"To avoid OBC anger fallout, a Shinde Sena MP endorses nationwide caste census demand","In what is seemingly a bid to placate the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) who have been unhappy with the Maharashtra government’s decision to provide reservation to Marathas under the OBC quota, an MP from the Shiv Sena led by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde on Tuesday backed the demand for a nationwide caste census.
Buldhana MP Prataprao Jadhav, in a debate on the Bill to grant reservations to OBCs in Jammu and Kashmir, said the percentage of OBCs in Maharashtra was on the rise. “Following the movement for Maratha reservation (led by activist Manoj Jarange-Patil), around 57 lakh people are being given Kunbi certificates. There has been a demand for a caste census in Parliament too. If a caste census is done along with the general census in 2026-’27, reservation for OBCs can be increased in states where their population is found to be higher. Similarly, quota can be reduced wherever it is found that their population has decreased,” he said.
This is the first time that a Sena leader has voiced his support for the nationwide census, a demand that is the Opposition’s key poll plank. The Shinde-led government, comprising BJP and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) led by Ajit Pawar, has so far only spoken in favour of a caste survey in Maharashtra.Advertisement
“In Maharashtra, Kolis, Dhangars, and Lingayats, among others, have been agitating for reservation. I request the government that a census of these communities be conducted and appropriate reservation is granted to them. The Centre must give proper instructions to the state governments,” Jadhav said.

The parliamentarian’s comments come close on the heels of the Maharashtra government giving in to the pressure of the agitation led by Jarange-Patil. With the activist applying pressure, the government last month issued a draft notification that said Marathas and their “sage soyre (blood relatives)” would be issued Kunbi certificates, thus enabling them to avail reservation under the OBC quota.
The Sena-BJP-NCP Mahayuti government was red-faced after state Cabinet Minister Chhagan Bhujbal of the NCP opposed the move. Bhujbal, seen as one of the tallest OBC leaders in the state, has been vocal against Marathas being accommodated in the OBC category and, in the past, has urged them to respond to Maratha quota agitators “in the same vein”. He was also critical of their inclusion during a mega OBC rally held last December as a counter to Jarange-Patil’s agitation.
Against this backdrop, Jadhav’s comments are being perceived as the Maharashtra government’s move to placate OBCs who have been up in arms against the draft notification as they are wary of Maratha reservation eating into their quota. While his deputies have spoken in favour of a caste survey in the state, Shinde has so far avoided making a clear statement. “An appropriate decision will be taken on the issue after seeking the opinion of all sections of society,” he said in December. That statement came a day after senior RSS functionary Shridhar Gadge said there was no need for a caste census and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi reiterated his party would conduct a caste census if voted to power in the Lok Sabha polls and also remove the 50% cap on quotas.Advertisement
Jadhav, however, criticised the Congress and said it saw benefit in keeping the poor and the backward as they are. “They opposed the Mandal Commission report tooth and nail. It is under the Narendra Modi government that OBCs will get reservation in Jammu and Kashmir after 75 years,” he said.
Baramati MP Supriya Sule, who is NCP leader Sharad Pawar’s daughter, also raised the issue and said the government was doing nothing despite demands for reservation from many communities in Maharashtra. “Can they please specify what is their stand on SC/ST and OBC reservations? They should bring a nationwide policy on reservations. They have a triple-engine government in Maharashtra but no elections are happening in local bodies in the state,” she said.",politics
"Mixing farm outreach with Hindutva, Nadda set to flag off BJP’s rural yatra from Muzaffarnagar","BJP national president J P Nadda is set to launch the party’s farm yatra on February 12 from Muzaffarnagar in western Uttar Pradesh ahead of the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. The region was one of the key hubs of the farmers’ movement against the now-repealed three central farm laws, which had led to UP-Delhi border at Ghazipur being blocked for over a year in 2020-21.
The BJP plans to reach about two lakh villages – about a third of India’s total number of villages – through this nationwide yatra. At the flag-off event, where UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will also be present, Nadda will address a “kisan-mazdoor” (farmers and workers) rally.
The yatra will seek suggestions from farmers regarding their demands and expectations. The BJP Kisan Morcha’s national chief Rajkumar Chahar, the Fatehpur Sikri Lok Sabha MP, is organising it.Advertisement
“We had made plans for a Gram Parikrama Yatra some time back. We will go across each village we visit, worship local village deities, worship a cow and a tractor, and have a farmers’ chaupal. We will also give its farmers details of the work done by the Modi government. We will ask them about their suggestions. We will visit 4,500 villages in one day. We plan to do it for a month and will stop once elections are announced,” Chahar told The Indian Express.

“We will appeal to farmers to take to organic farming so as to preserve the soil and the health of people. We will also appeal to farmers to grow millets. They are healthy, require less water and also fetch a good price. We will filter the suggestions coming state-wise and submit them to Nadda ji to be incorporated (in the poll manifesto),” he said.
Combining the party’s farm message with its Hindutva pitch, Nadda will kick off the yatra from Shukra Taal – associated in legend with Veda Vyas, who is considered as the author of the epic Mahabharat – in Muzaffarnagar after ceremonial worship of a cow, tractor and a plough. It would be live-streamed across all zilla headquarters of the party across the country, where 300 prominent local farmers would be invited to watch it.
Nadda would also felicitate farmers’ leaders and ex-soldiers in a region that is known both for sugarcane farming and sending large numbers of soldiers to the Indian armed forces.Advertisement
There seem to be two key reasons for the BJP to roll out this yatra besides its optics. One, farmers constitute a significant chunk of India’s population. And, two, the Narendra Modi government had faced organised protests for months from farmers of Punjab, Haryana and western UP against its three farm laws that it was later forced to roll back. These protests had led to the blocking of some key roads on Delhi’s borders with Haryana and UP.

The launch of the yatra from Muzaffarnagar is also remarkable as the belt has a significant population of the Jat community, which was at the forefront of the farm agitation. Large sections of Jats are either into farming or armed forces. The most vocal face of the farm agitation was Rakesh Tikait, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader and son of the BKU stalwart late Mahendra Singh Tikait, who hails from Sisauli village of Muzaffarnagar and also belongs to the Balyan Khap (clan), the largest Jat Khap of UP.
The yatra will also convey information about various schemes of the Modi government to farmers across regions.
According to the BJP Kisan Morcha, the feedback from farmers in the course of yatra would be passed on to Nadda for their inclusion in the BJP’s manifesto for the Lok Sabha polls.Advertisement
The yatra would also be in sync with PM Modi’s stance that his dispensation recognises only four castes – women, youth, farmers and the poor. This has been the PM’s counter to the Opposition’s caste census pitch, even as the BJP has also sought to reach out to the OBCs (Other Backward Classes), EBCs (Extremely Backward Classes), Dalits and tribals through various moves.",politics
"Karnataka, Kerala bring campaign against ‘financial atrocities’ of Centre to Delhi","The Opposition-ruled states of Karnataka and Kerala are bringing their protest against the Centre’s alleged biased fiscal policies to the national capital, with Tamil Nadu lending its voice of support.
On Wednesday, the entire Karnataka ministry led by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, plus all the state’s Congress MLAs and MLCs, will be staging a sit-in at Jantar Mantar, to be followed a day later by Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan and his ministers. The ruling DMK in Tamil Nadu has said it will join the protests.
Siddaramaiah called his government’s ‘Chalo Delhi’ protest as the first-ever by Karnataka against the fiscal policies of the Centre. In front-page ads splashed across newspapers in Karnataka on Tuesday, the Congress government said the protest was against “the financial atrocities committed by the Central government on Kannadigas and Karnataka”. The Congress announced a simultaneous social media campaign, with the hashtag ‘My Tax My Right’.Advertisement
The CM also penned letters to all MPs from the state, including Union ministers Nirmala Sitharaman and Pralhad Joshi, and JD(S) supremo H D Deve Gowda, asking them to extend support to the state’s cause. Deputy CM D K Shivakumar said the protest was “a non-partisan struggle for the benefit of Kannadigas and Karnataka”.
In a briefing Monday, Siddaramaiah put the “losses” suffered by the state exchequer due to factors such as reduction of Karnataka’s share in the divisible pool of taxes and “faulty implementation of GST” at around Rs 1.87 lakh crore. The CM also claimed that despite the Union Budget’s size doubling between 2016-17 and 2022-23, there had been no marked increase in grants allocated to Karnataka.
The Kerala government has said its Thursday protest is meant to highlight “how the BJP-led government is neglecting the state by denying its due share of revenue in violation of principles of cooperative federalism”. Led by the CM and including his Cabinet colleagues, the protest will include all LDF MPs and MLAs.
Kerala has accused the Centre of “slashing the state’s borrowing limit”, an issue on which it has also moved the Supreme Court. Last month, the state Cabinet took out a month-long tour against the Union government’s “anti-people” policies.Advertisement
According to the Kerala government, there has been a fall of Rs 57,400 crore in state’s receipts from the Centre, a shortfall of Rs 12,000 crore in GST compensation, another cut of Rs 8,400 crore in this year’s revenue deficit grant, and a fall in Kerala’s eligible borrowing limit to Rs 28,830 crore from the Rs 39,626 crore it expected.
CPI(M) leader and Kerala Finance Minister K N Balagopal Tuesday said: “In a country where federal principles exist, such agitation is very rare. The Cabinet is going to Delhi to find remedy for the neglect towards the state.”
He also questioned the Congress-led UDF for not joining the protest despite acknowledging the neglect towards the state, adding: “The agitation of the Congress-led Karnataka Cabinet in Delhi will be an eyeopener for the Congress in Kerala. It ratifies our stand that the Centre has adopted a discriminatory stand towards Opposition-ruled states.”
In a boost for the Pinarayi government, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin, whose government includes the Congress, extended unequivocal support to the Kerala government’s protest on Tuesday.Advertisement
In his statement, Stalin appreciated the Kerala decision to go to the Supreme Court against the Centre, and said the situation had rapidly deteriorated in the last few years, with a clear consensus emerging among state governments over such control over their finances.
Offering his full support to the Kerala government, and saying Tamil Nadu “looked forward to collaborate and synchronise our efforts to address this crucial challenge”, he called for collective action by all states. “The fundamental principle of fiscal federalism envisioned by the Constitution makers is under grave threat,” he said.
The Tamil Nadu government has accused the Centre of exploiting its powers under Article 293 of the Constitution to severely limit the borrowing capacity of states. “The prior consent from the Union government, mandated by this section, has been converted into a restrictive tool to limit deficit financing,” Stalin said.
He asked why the Centre had pegged the state’s Gross State Domestic Product growth for calculating net borrowing ceiling at a mere 8%, despite Tamil Nadu achieving approximately 15% nominal growth in recent years, and also questioned the imposition of conditions for funding the losses of state-owned electricity distribution companies.Advertisement
He also raised “the deliberate delay” in approving infrastructure projects such as the Chennai Metro Rail Phase-II.
DMK spokesperson T K S Elangovan told The Indian Express that the party and Tamil Nadu government were giving their support to Kerala as well as Karnataka. “We will be joining the protests in Delhi,” he said.
Speaking in Parliament on Monday, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had strongly refuted claims that the Centre was withholding funds to non-BJP ruled states. The matter was raised by Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, the Congress MP from West Bengal, whose government led by the TMC has staged several protests on the issue.
Sitharaman said the devolution of taxes was based on the recommendations of the Finance Commission, and she had no discretionary powers. “This apprehension that some states are being discriminated against is a politically-vitiated narrative.”Advertisement
Earlier, the BJP had sought action against Congress Karnataka MP D K Suresh, for his comments after the interim budget was presented saying that the people of South India might have to demand “a separate country” given the “injustice” over their share in taxes.",politics
"As Thalapathy Vijay heads for political debut, a look at why cinema, politics make a compelling script in Tamil Nadu","Tamil Nadu’s political landscape, where film stars like M G Ramachandran (MGR) and J Jayalalithaa have occupied the chief minister’s chair, has seen an effortless blend of politics and cinema over the years.
The latest addition to this is “Thalapathy” Vijay, whose popularity and stardom match the likes of MGR and Rajnikanth, who has announced a foray into the political arena of the state with his party Tamizha Vetri Kazhagam.
So, is it easier for superstars in Tamil Nadu to transition to politics, or just more talked about? And where does it fit into the fact that the politics of the state has a strong undercurrent of sub-regionalism and identity and culture politics, putting it apart from its counterparts?Advertisement
Since the 1960s, scholars have been trying to capture the cinema-politics intersection in the state, most notably Robert L Hardgrave, and his contemporary Karthigesu Sivathamby, a distinguished Sri Lankan Tamil scholar from the University of Jaffna.
These academic endeavours highlighted the state’s distinctive use of film for political expression, often drawing parallels with instances of cinematic “propaganda”.

At the same time, experts who have studied the communication project of the Dravidian movement argue that these deep-rooted cultural narratives have contributed to the easy evolution of cine stars into political leaders.
The MGR phenomenon, for instance, was the outcome of a decades-long communication strategy of the DMK. From its inception in 1949, the party started publication of magazines in every district of the state to ensure communication with its cadre, apart from using the medium of theatre to drive the party’s message. Its final medium in this was cinema.Advertisement
Dr Gopalan Ravindran, Head of the Media and Communication Department at the Central University of Tamil Nadu, says researchers like Hardgrave missed the picture, with their writings centred around seeking the “strange others” in the Tamil audience and in its affinity towards film star-turned-politicians. “Post the Second World War, the derivative attention on India and other Third World countries was borne out of geopolitical interests and not academic curiosity, and was aimed to categorise and understand Tamil Nadu and India for the US State Department,” he says.
This impression was helped along by English-speaking media, particularly upper caste Tamil commentators, say experts, who saw themselves threatened by the anti-Brahminic messages inherent in Dravidian cinema.
Ravindran says: “Figures like Cho Ramaswamy (a popular yesteryear actor, writer and public commentator) were frequently quoted in newspapers, echoing these views. This shaped a casteist, media-driven perception of the state’s politics and its so-called nexus with cinema, outside Tamil Nadu.”
Ravindran contrasts MGR’s rise in politics with Rajnikanth’s, for example. “At the grassroots, Rajni is seen as a star and not a politician. Unlike MGR, who rose to political heights riding on the Dravidian movement, he does not have an ideology backing him. MGR connected with people through the movement and not just his films,” he says, adding that Rajinikanth could not leverage his immense popularity into politics due to the lack of ideological support and a movement’s backing.Advertisement
Explained | Will ‘Thalapathy’ Vijay disrupt Tamil Nadu politics?
There are other examples of celebrities in the political sphere failing without the backing of a movement, such as Ganesan, even as others who had this support, such as M Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa, forged ahead. Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) founder Captain Vijayakanth tasted success, but only for a brief period. The career of others like Sarathkumar and T Rajender remained still-born. More recently, Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) and Seeman’s Naam Tamilar Katchi have struggled to convert cinematic fame into electoral results.
Former professor of philosophy at Madras Christian College Dr James Kurian sees the relatively larger success achieved by cinema stars in Tamil Nadu as politicians to the preference shown by its voters for a unifying leader, cutting across differences in society. “Tamil Nadu has a rich history, going back to the eras of the Chera and Chola dynasties, and is heavily influenced by the timeless wisdom of Tirukkural… This sets a high benchmark for people’s idea of a leader. Every Tamil is familiar with their ancient kings, kingdoms and their stories… Popular leaders in the state in recent decades too have been strong-willed, powerful leaders who ran a centralised leadership,” he says.",politics
Priyanka says Modi ‘misrepresented’ Nehru speech: Here is what the late PM said,"A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi attacked Jawaharlal Nehru in his speech in Parliament – suggesting that the Congress leader thought Indians were lazy and of low intelligence, and that the party “never trusted India’s potential” – Priyanka Gandhi Vadra slammed the PM of “misrepresenting” Nehru’s speech.
Calling it “shameful” and reflective of the “bitterness” in the minds of the BJP towards the freedom movement, Priyanka said in a social media post, “Did Pandit Nehru, the guardian of India’s consciousness, consider Indians lazy?”, going on to share the audio recording of the speech.
She also said that Nehru said what he did at a time when India was struggling to come out of the years of exploitation of British Raj. “There were millions of deaths due to famine and starvation. If the Prime Minister of such a country tells his people that they have to stand on our own feet, work hard, and compete with the developed countries. Is that a crime? If the Prime Minister of a newly independent country inspires its people to become self-reliant, is it an insult to the people?” Priyanka said.Advertisement

Modi was referring to the speech Nehru delivered on Independence Day, 1959, in Hindi. The year was marked by statehood agitations over language, while July 31 saw the dismissal of the first elected Communist government, in Kerala, by use of Article 356.
This is the full speech:
“Dear sisters, brothers and friends,
We are gathered today again to celebrate the anniversary of our freedom… It’s been 12 years… in the thousands of years of this country, it is too little time… In these 12 years, you, us, all the people of Hindustan have tried to come out of the past, the problems of the past, the poverty of the past… It was a difficult task, more difficult than getting the country out of slavery, because it needed ridding ourselves of our weaknesses and the thousands of burdens we were carrying… What happened, didn’t happen, is before you… A lot of good things happened, a lot of bad things happened… and things also happened which weakened us or reflected our weakness…
A lot of these difficulties arose out of natural disasters… but many among us also took wrong steps. In their greed, selfishness, they forgot where the good of the country lay… Today too you are caught up in difficulties, such as inflation. Many things are out of our control, though eventually we will rise above them…
But today is the day that we should specifically look back at what we are, what we want to be, what path we want to take… We need to recall the time of 12 years back, when our great leader Gandhiji was with us, and we would look up to him… How far do we remember those things…Advertisement
The first thing before us is to keep the country united, because if we allow ourselves to be divided, whether on grounds of region, language, caste, religion… it dissipates our power, we fall, we can’t get ahead…
The second thing is, what has always been our purpose? It is economic, social, to rid Hindustan of poverty… But at the end of the day, how do you measure these things? Gandhiji showed us one way… The people who are already ahead, we don’t have to worry too much about them… They are well-equipped to take care of themselves, make themselves heard. But the common people, who are usually silent, especially those who live in villages, who will look after them?… You and I have the good fortune to live in Delhi, but Delhi city is not Hindustan, it’s the Capital of Hindustan.
Hindustan is made up of lakhs of villages, and till these lakhs of villages rise… Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta can’t take Hindustan forward. That is why we have to keep these villages in mind, how they develop… They will grow with your and our efforts, but at the end of the day, they will grow because of their own efforts, strength, trusting themselves… The problem we are facing at this time is that our people have stopped trusting themselves, they feel someone else will come to help…
It’s become a habit to see if government officials will help, the government will help… That is why schemes have been made, community development etc, which can be revolutionary for India, for the world, if they work well…Advertisement
(But) The momentum has to come from within, it can’t be imposed from above… It is a big question before us that the people, whether in cities, villages, we stand on our feet… The government must help the administration, officials in every way possible, but the country doesn’t develop because of officials alone; it does so due to its own efforts…
In fact, my wish is that the government role is minimal, that the people take their reins in own hands…
Look at the khushaal (prosperous) countries, how are they prosperous? It is due to their efforts and hard work, be it America, Europe or some Asian countries… In our country, that habit of working very hard is not common. It’s not our fault, habits develop as per circumstances. But the fact remains that we do not work as much as the people of Europe, America, Japan or Russia… So, we too can grow with hard work and intelligence, there is no other alternative… Because the world runs on the hard work of people, whether it is the farmers, the labourers, the shopkeepers or the artisans…
I was pleased to see that recently Punjab increased its working hours, it will benefit the state… We have so many holidays that no other country can compete with us on the same… Holidays are good, but too much of them can make one weak, dilute the habit of working…Advertisement
As you know, we are on the threshold of the Third Five Year Plan… We have seen two, seen their benefits… big iron factories are coming up, big things are being manufactured… these will breathe a new life into every corner of the country, for new plants, new industrialists, new jobs for lakhs of people… all towards creating a solid monument to a new, prosperous Hindustan…
I want you to understand that the Third Five Year Plan will bring no time for leisure either… We can’t grow without hard work and facing problems head on. Those who don’t, they fall behind, their country falls behind…
So we again have a test before us, a challenge… the world’s eyes are on us, as to what the country that once gave us Mahatma Gandhi will do… It’s not just about the big schemes, the factories, the farms… but that while doing these important things, how we do them. Should we do it holding our heads up, proudly, or hanging our heads in shame, taking the wrong path?…
This was the main message of Gandhiji for us too…Advertisement
So in this 13th year of our country, let’s walk together holding our heads high, hand in hand, in step, with the resolve to meet our goals.
Jai Hind!”",politics
"Exam paper leaks: Mounting cases, aspirants affected, parties have made it an election issue","The Centre on Monday tabled the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Bill in Parliament which has provision of a 10-year jail term and fine up to Rs 1 crore for those found guilty of malpractices.
Paper leaks and violation of conduct rules in public exams in the recent past have become a significant part of political discourse and have found extensive mentions, particularly during campaigning ahead of elections.
The Indian Express investigated 41 documented instances of leaks over the last five years in recruitment exams across 15 states — their governments cutting across party lines. The investigation revealed that the leaks derailed the schedules of as many as 1.4 crore applicants, who were vying for a little over 1.04 lakh posts.Advertisement
Rajasthan saw the most number of leaks with seven. The exams were being held to fill over 6,000 posts and over 8 lakh aspirants had applied for them. In the run-up to the recently concluded Rajasthan elections, the BJP used the paper leak issue to target the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government. In one of his campaign rallies, Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused the Congress of “selling papers of all government exams”.
With the state seeing a spate of paper leaks and malpractices under the Congress government, the BJP, during its campaign, repeatedly promised to probe all paper leaks if voted to power. In January 2023, amid the BJP’s attacks, the Gehlot government carried out demolition of part of the house of one of the accused in one of cases.
Soon after it won the Rajasthan election, the BJP government set up a SIT to probe cases of paper leaks and malpractices, and last month, the Rajasthan Public Services Commission (RPCS) exam was conducted amid tight security.
The issue also figured in the political discourse of poll-bound Telangana, which saw five instances of paper leaks, in the run-up to the Assembly elections. In March last year, the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) government’s cancellation of the Telangana State Public Services Commission (TSPSC) exam over an alleged leak took a political turn after a 22-year-old woman aspirant allegedly died by suicide over the cancellation.Advertisement
Congress MP Rahul Gandhi slammed the K Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) government and accused it of ignoring the voice of the youth. Congress leader A Revanth Reddy was placed under house arrest to prevent him from joining the protesting aspirants.
Following the change of government, CM Revanth Reddy saw to the resignation of TSPSC chairman Janardhan Reddy.
In Bihar too, the leaks have led to political heat. In May 2022, over six lakh aspirants were left in the lurch after the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) cancelled its preliminary examination after allegations of a leak. The exam was being held to fill 802 vacancies. CM Nitish Kumar promised a thorough enquiry in the matter.
Tejashwi Yadav, who was still to join hands with Nitish at the time, said, “The BPSC name should be changed to ‘Bihar Lok Paper Leak Ayog’ for playing with the lives of crores of youth and candidates.”Advertisement
In June 2023, a massive row erupted after protesting Teachers Eligibility Test (TET) aspirants were lathicharged by the Bihar Police in Patna, demanding changes in domicile rules. A total of 59 protesters, including then state BJP chief and current Bihar deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary, were booked.
Uttar Pradesh is another state where the issue gained political proportions. In November 2021, the Uttar Pradesh Teachers Eligibility Test (UPTET) was cancelled following reports of a leak. Over 20 lakh aspirants were scheduled to take the test.
CM Yogi Adityanath promised that the culprits would be brought to book and the stringent National Security Act invoked. BJP MP Varun Gandhi slammed his party’s government over the leak, while the Samajwadi Party alleged that those being patronised by the government were involved in the leak and claimed papers of 18 competitive exams had leaked since Adityanath took over the reins of the state in 2017.
Some other states where exam paper leaks have taken a political colour include Maharashtra, where the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) said in the Legislative Council that unemployment and paper leaks were “the only guarantees that the Modi government can provide”.Advertisement
In Andhra Pradesh, the arrest of Telugu Desam Party (TDP) MLA P Narayana in connection with a Class 10 paper leak saw a political slugfest, with the N Chandrababu Naidu-led party alleging political witch-hunt on the part of the ruling YSRCP government.
In Odisha, the BJP and Congress took on the Naveen Patnaik government after the leak of Odisha Staff Selection Commission (OSSC) exam paper for the post of junior engineers. “Though the BJD government has been making tall claims, the question paper leak showed that there is no transparency in the examination process. Question papers cannot be leaked without the involvement of someone in the OSSC,” Odisha Congress chief Sarat Pattanayak said.",politics
"Behind Odisha CM Patnaik move to name new ISBT after Ambedkar, BJD’s Dalit outreach, countering Oppn","Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik seems to have set his sights on multiple goals with his decision to name the newly-built Bhubaneswar inter-state bus terminal (ISBT) after B R Ambedkar, the Dalit icon and architect of the Constitution.
The new ISBT, the largest in Odisha and equipped with “airport-like facilities”, will be known as Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar Bus Terminal. It is the first major project in the state named after Ambedkar. Spread across 15.5 acres, the ISBT, built at a cost of Rs 180 crore, is likely to be inaugurated by the CM later this month. The project was closely monitored by Patnaik’s close confidant and Vision 5T secretary V K Pandian, who visited the site on January 30.
To raise awareness about Ambedkar’s contributions to nation- building, the terminal will also have a special 900-sq-foot gallery to showcase the life and ideals of the Dalit icon. Some of Ambedkar’s belongings will also be exhibited at the gallery, Patnaik said.Advertisement
“Ambedkar was a visionary leader and a dedicated social reformer. He was a ray of hope for the Dalits and oppressed sections of the society. He has worked all his life to create society with equal justice for all,” Patnaik said.
Numbers matter
With the naming of the ISBT after Ambedkar just a couple of months before the simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly polls, the move is viewed as Patnaik’s attempt to reach out to the Dalit community, which accounts for 17.13% of the state’s population. Of Odisha’s 4.19 crore population, according to the 2011 Census, 71.88 lakh people were identified as belonging to the Scheduled Castes (SC).
As many as 24 of the 147 seats in the state Assembly and 3 of the 21 Lok Sabha seats are reserved for the SC candidates. In 2019, the ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) had secured 19 of these 24 Assembly seats while the BJP had bagged five. In the Lok Sabha, the BJD had won all three seats reserved for the SCs.
Even though the caste matrix has not played a direct role in Odisha’s politics so far, such moves may help develop a positive perception for the BJD among Dalits and help the party to consolidate their votes in its favour.
Bid to counter Opp narrativeAdvertisement
The decision could help Patnaik and his government rid itself of the impression of pivoting around the name of his father and former CM Biju Patnaik. The BJD, which has been in power since March 2000, has named over a dozen schemes and structures like airports, parks, universities and market complexes after Biju.
“More than electoral benefits, the decision will help the CM create an image of a leader who has high regard for the Constitution of India and a leader who is working towards eliminating discrimination. It would boost his image of a socialist leader who cares for the welfare of all sections of society,” said a senior bureaucrat.
Considering Ambedkar’s iconic image and his acceptance across sections, there is likely to be little criticism from the Opposition.
According to BJD insiders, the move is also seen as an attempt by the ruling party, which is seeking a sixth straight term in the coming Assembly elections, to counter the Congress’s recent push to regain ground in Odisha. The grand old party has upped the ante by “exposing close ties” between the BJD and the BJP, especially those between Patnaik and the BJP’s top central leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.Advertisement
“The Congress’s new Odisha in-charge (Ajoy Kumar) is trying to develop a narrative that the BJD and BJP are one and project the grand old party as the only Opposition in Odisha. Congress national president Mallikarjun Kharge also raked up the same issue while Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is also expected to target the BJD along similar lines during his ongoing Yatra, which will reach Odisha on Tuesday. The tribute to Ambedkar will be a fitting issue to counter their narrative,” a BJD leader said.
Kharge, who addressed a rally in Bhubaneswar on January 29, had hailed Biju Patnaik for extending cooperation to past Congress governments in setting up organisations like the National Aluminium Company, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, the steel plant in Rourkela, the Navy base in Chilka and the airport in Bhubaneswar. But Kharge accused Naveen Patnaik of siding with BJP leaders to “plunder the state’s natural resources”.",politics
"Uttarakhand’s UCC Bill targets Muslim identity, deals a blow to country’s diversity: AIMPLB","The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has strongly objected to the move of the BJP-led government in Uttarakhand to bring the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) Bill, charging that the proposed legislation targeted the identity of the Muslim community besides inflicting damage on the country’s diversity.
Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami tabled the UCC Bill in the state Assembly on Tuesday, which seeks to bring uniformity in laws governing marriage, divorce, and inheritance, among other things, across religions. It proposes the banning of practices like polygamy and bringing in a uniform marriage age for citizens from all communities.
Commenting on the Dhami government’s move, AIMPLB spokesperson Syed Qasim Rasool Ilyas said, “We are protesting UCC. This UCC is against the diversity of the country. This is the country of different religions, culture and different languages and we have accepted that diversity. If you try to implement such a Uniform Civil Code, then you are causing a damage to that diversity.”Advertisement

Ilyas also said, “Secondly, you are forcing a majoritarian point of view on everyone. You have drafted the UCC considering a particular Hindu religion and imposing it on everyone.” He asked if tribals have been exempted from the UCC, why the same yardstick cannot be applied to Muslims too?
The AIMPLB spokesperson said the UCC Bill’s provisions would clash with the Muslim religious laws or personal laws, which are derived from the holy Quran.
“An optional Uniform Civil Code already exists. There are Special Marriage Act and Succession Act. Anyone who does not want to get governed by religious laws, that couple can get married under Special Marriage Act. Religious personal law will not be applicable on that particular couple. They will be governed by secular law. When optional UCC is available, then why there is need of new UCC from the government?” he asked.

Ilyas alleged that the government’s objective behind bringing UCC was to affect the identity of Muslims. “Muslim’s identity is governed by religion. Religious identity is defined by religious laws. If you finish their religious laws, their religious identity will get finished.”Advertisement
He said the BJP government tabled the UCC Bill ahead of the Lok Sabha elections to send out a message that they have fulfilled their UCC promise.
Ilyas said the AIMPLB’s legal committee was studying the provisions of Uttarakhand’s UCC Bill and that the Board will explore options to seek legal remedies as per the advice of this panel.
The AIMPLB spokesperson asked a big question remained as to “what are you going to achieve from this UCC?”
Some other Muslim bodies also echoed similar concerns. Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind secretary Niaz Ahmed Farooqui said, “Now the UCC document has been made public. We are studying the UCC Bill document because we need solid facts to oppose it.”Advertisement
Jamaat-e-Islami Hind vice-president Saleem Engineer said that a UCC would not be possible in a country like India which has so much diversity of faiths, cultures, traditions and ethnic groups. He said the UCC has become a political issue being used for communal polarisation ahead of the Lok Sabha elections for political dividends.
“Uttarakhand UCC has provision that tribal will be excluded. If tribals are excluded, then how is it uniform?” he asked.
Engineer also said, “There is not much Muslim population in Uttarakhand but UCC has been brought there. It means, a sense of fear is created among minorities… They are doing it in Uttarakhand as an experiment.”
On the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind’s next course of action on the issue, he said, “Large population of non-Muslims too do not like such politics and tactics of polarisation. If anything is happening which can damage the society, which can weaken social harmony, peace, social fabric and democratic atmosphere, or affect religious freedom, certainly we will oppose it in a democratic and peaceful manner.”",politics
"JD(U) says ‘no political meaning’ as days after its switch, ED tightens screws against its Bihar MLC","Days after the JD(U) switched sides to join the NDA, its MLC Radha Charan Sah, who is in Enforcement Directorate custody, saw the attachment of his properties worth over Rs 26 crore as part of a money laundering investigation linked to alleged illegal sand mining in the state.
The JD(U) said no political implications should be drawn from the action. Its national spokesperson Rajib Ranjan told The Indian Express: “Sah and his son Kanhaiya Sah have been facing ED cases for a while now. The ED attaching their property is part of the investigation and judicial process. No political meaning should be read into it.”
Sah, Kanhaiya and directors of a firm allegedly linked to him were arrested by the ED last year and are currently in judicial custody. A chargesheet was filed against them in November 2023.Advertisement
At the time, the JD(U), then in the rival Mahagathbandhan camp, had slammed the ED action as part of “the BJP’s political vendetta to browbeat its political opponents ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls”.
Neeraj Kumar, a fellow JD(U) MLC and party spokesperson, had said: “While it is a known fact that the BJP has been using Central agencies for political vendetta as per its political convenience, we want to know why the ED does not arrest some Maharashtra politicians who have been under its scanner.”
In a statement Tuesday, the ED said that “the illegal sale of sand and its mining were mainly controlled by a syndicate, and Radha Charan Sah, being a syndicate member, generated huge proceeds of crime”, and that these were “layered and laundered” with the assistance of his son Kanhaiya.
The ED has accused Sah of using the proceeds of crime for the acquisition and development of a resort in Manali, and construction at a school in Ghaziabad.Advertisement
Popularly known as Radha Charan ‘Seth’, Sah’s rise to riches is a well-known story – of a jalebi seller in the 1970s who gradually came to own a hotel, a resort, a rice mill and a cold storage facility in Arrah, the district headquarters of Bhojpur. He also owns hotels in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh.
Last year, a party hosted by Sah in Arrah for Kanhaiya’s 25th wedding anniversary, attended by several politicians, was the talk of the state.
It was Sah’s growing affluence that brought him close to political parties, and he initially developed proximity to RJD president Lalu Prasad and former RJD MP Prabhunath Singh, who is currently serving a life term for murder cases. It eventually led to the RJD offering him an MLC ticket from Arrah, which he lost.
Finally, he was elected MLC from the Bhojpur-Buxar Local Authority constituency in the 2022 elections, and became JD(U) state general secretary for local bodies.Advertisement
In his election affidavit, Sah declared moveable and immoveable assets worth over Rs 5.5 crore, as well as an Arms Act and a forgery case against himself.",politics
"From the Urdu Press: ‘Gyanvapi row: but Muslims should keep seeking justice’, ‘Kharge needs to rise to stem INDIA rot’","As the Gyanvapi mosque-Kashi Vishwanath temple row heats up with the Varanasi district court allowing puja to be performed in the mosque’s cellar, the minority side braced for a new round of legal battle right up to the highest court in the land. The Urdu dailies tracked the developments on this fraught issue, highlighting the despair and hopes of leading Muslim organisations.
The dailies also kept their focus on the battle shaping up for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls, finding the Opposition INDIA camp in a shambles without even the will to fight the BJP.
URDU TIMES
Commenting on the Varanasi district court’s order to allow puja in the southern cellar of the Gyanvapi mosque adjacent to the Kashi Vishwanath temple, the Mumbai-based Urdu Times, in its February 4 editorial under the title “Insaaf mangte raho (Continue seeking justice)!”, writes that apprehensions had been expressed during the Babri Masjid row that, once it was replaced by the Ram Temple, other mosques would start facing threats. Referring to the Supreme Court’s November 2019 judgment in favour of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, the editorial points out that the verdict also stated that the demolition of the Babri Masjid was a criminal act, and highlighted the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, which stipulates that the religious character of a place of worship in the country, barring the one at Ayodhya, shall continue to be the same as it was on August 15, 1947. “However, after the inauguration of the Temple in Ayodhya, other disputes are now being stoked — and the Gyanvapi mosque figures on top of that list,” the daily says. “The disturbing thing is that the impartiality of the judicial system seems to have been compromised in such matters.”Advertisement

The editorial notes that the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has asserted that the Varanasi court’s “hasty” decision to allow puja at the mosque basement has pained the minority community and hurt the confidence of people in the judiciary. The edit says that the claim that puja was performed there until 1993 has been contested, but the court did not give the other side a chance to present its case.
“The judiciary needs to examine why there has been such a push now for searching temples in historical mosques. India is a secular country as per its Constitution, which provides for equality between all religions,” the daily says. “In all such disputes, the Muslim community should keep pursuing legal remedies to seek justice while maintaining restraint and patience.”
SIASAT
Highlighting the state of affairs in the Opposition camp, the Hyderabad-based Siasat, in its editorial on February 3, says that the INDIA bloc formed to take on the BJP has yet to become a stable and effective platform for the purpose. One of its architects, Nitish Kumar has crossed over to the BJP. Other leading lights of the alliance have not been able to put their act together, failing to hammer out a common formula for the formidable electoral battle ahead, the daily states. “From the SP’s Akhilesh Yadav to the TMC’s Mamata Banerjee to the AAP’s Arvind Kejriwal — none of them seems to be satisfied with the situation. They have continued to indulge in heated exchanges. After Nitish’s exit, it was expected that other INDIA leaders will close their ranks by setting aside their egos. But, clearly, they have chosen their own narrow interest over the alliance’s objective of countering the BJP unitedly.”

The BJP wanted a divided Opposition so that their road to victory does not run into any bumps, says the editorial. “The BJP’s slogan for the Lok Sabha polls is ‘Abki bar, 400 seats paar (400 seats this time)’. And a key aspect of its strategy is to ensure that the Opposition camp remains a divided house,” it states. While the INDIA alliance’s regional parties have their role in the states, the Congress, as its largest constituent, must rise to the occasion and steer the drifting bloc back on track, the edit says. “Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge should play a more proactive role with regard to the bloc’s affairs, even as Rahul Gandhi is continuing with the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra,” it says, adding that the Opposition parties do not have any option other than fighting the BJP together. “And this is their political and moral obligation.”
SALARAdvertisement
Referring to the continuing standoff between Delhi Chief Minister and AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal and Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the alleged Delhi liquor policy scam, the Bengaluru-based Salar, in its editorial on February 5, says that following the arrest of former Jharkhand CM and JMM leader Hemant Soren by the ED in an alleged land scam, the threat of arrest by the central agency is looming over Kejriwal too.
“While the ED issued its fifth summons to Kejriwal for questioning him in the excise policy case, the Delhi CM maintained that the agency’s move was illegal. Kejriwal also alleged that the Narendra Modi-led BJP government was trying to destabilise his government as it does not want him to be free to lead his party’s campaign in the Lok Sabha polls,” the daily says, adding that the AAP chief has also charged that the BJP had made an offer to him to join the party in exchange for dropping all investigations. “Kejriwal said he rejected the BJP’s offer since they had not done anything wrong. He said they were following Mahatma Gandhi’s path of truth which will win eventually.”

The editorial notes that the AAP leaders have maintained from the beginning that they had not indulged in any any wrongdoing in the Delhi excise policy case. If the ED is involved in a “witch-hunt” against the AAP leaders at the behest of their political masters, it would further damage democracy, the edit says. “Hemant Soren had also been refraining from appearing before the ED in response to its repeated summonses, but the agency eventually went to his premises to question him and then arrested him,” it states. Hemant was then forced to resign as the CM. “Kejriwal is himself indicating that he could be subjected to a similar action. He has already held deliberations over such a possibility with his AAP colleagues and legislators, firming up an action plan in the event of his arrest,” the edit adds.",politics
"Decode Politics: Behind Akhilesh’s PDA game plan against BJP, bid to rejig social math, expand vote bank","Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav has claimed that most of the backward people, Dalits and minorities would unitedly back the PDA — Picchde (backward classes or OBCs), Dalits and Alpsankhyak (minorities) — plank of his party in Uttar Pradesh in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls due to which the ruling BJP’s “equations and previous formulas” would fail this time.
In a post in Hindi on X, Akhilesh said: “Survey of those who believe in PDA: Overall 90% say– 49% backward people have faith in PDA, 16% Dalits have faith in PDA, 21% minorities (Muslims+Sikhs+Buddhists+Christians+Jains and others+tribals) believe in PDA, 4% backwards of the upper castes have confidence in PDA. (All the above include ‘aadhi abadi’ i.e. women). Most of these 90% will vote unitedly for PDA this time.”
The Leader of the Opposition in the UP Assembly, Akhilesh also claimed, “Due to this (PDA factor), the BJP is neither able to do any math nor make any equation. This is why all the previous formulas of the BJP have failed this time and the BJP has lagged far behind in the selection of candidates. The BJP is not getting candidates at all. No one wants to fight to lose by taking the BJP ticket.”Advertisement
Akhilesh also gave a slogan, saying “Li hai PDA ne angdai, Bhajpa ki shamat aayi (PDA has set off,
the end of BJP has come)”.

What is PDA?
The PDA (Picchde, Dalits and Alpsankhyak) acronym was first used by Akhilesh in June 2023. He floated this formula as a counter to the BJP-led NDA, claiming on multiple occasions that “PDA hi NDA ko harayega (It will be the PDA which will defeat the BJP-led NDA)”.
The SP’s core vote bank has traditionally comprised of Yadavs and Muslims in UP. The party has however been losing the elections in the state since 2014 — the 2014 Lok Sabha polls (got five out of 80 seats), 2017 Assembly polls (won 47 out of 403 seats), 2019 Lok Sabha polls (got five seats) and 2022 Assembly polls (won 111 seats).Advertisement
The PDA idea reflects Akhilesh’s aim to expand the SP’s traditional vote bank to encompass Dalits, OBCs other than Yadavs, and minorities other than Muslims. Akhilesh has also said that the PDA would also include “backwards” among forward castes which are traditionally part of the BJP’s vote bank.
Akhilesh’s PDA plan
SP leaders say that the PDA represents a “rainbow coalition of communities” and would be therefore more appealing to the masses, which would help the party’s outreach to a much wider segment of the population.
Some SP leaders say that a section of Dalits has become “disenchanted” with the BSP as “they see
that BSP supremo Mayawati ji does not take on the BJP”. They claim that the Dalit community is looking for an “alternative”, which provides an opportunity to the SP to get them on board.Advertisement
“Our party chief (Akhilesh) has been hailing B R Ambedkar and other Dalit icons, which signals
that we are trying to reach out to Dalits,” said an SP leader.
“OBCs other than Yadavs are also among our target audience because we want to make them believe that the SP is the only party that can help them in UP. They constitute the highest numbers in terms of population percentage in the state,” the SP leader said. “Muslims are the largest minority, who have always backed the SP,” he said, adding that a larger platform like the PDA would “not only galvanise Muslims but also other minority groups in favour of the SP”.
Akhilesh’s caste census pitch
At his public meetings in recent months Akhilesh has been repeatedly demanding a caste census, maintaining that a caste survey in UP would ensure communities’ equitable share in reservation and government schemes for their development and welfare based on their proportion in the population.Advertisement
The SP chief has also been accusing the BJP of allegedly making attempts to undermine the reservation regime ensured by the Constitution. These are part of his bids to woo communities like the OBCs and Dalits, which benefit from quota in jobs and education.
SP’s social calculus
While the SP seems to be assured in its expectation that the Muslim community would rally behind it to defeat the BJP, the party needs more than the Muslim vote to pull off a win in UP. Muslims constitute
about 20% of UP’s population and their full backing for the SP in the 2022 polls was a key factor for the improvement of its tally as compared to the 2017 polls.
In the last few elections, the votes of non-Yadav OBCs have played a crucial role in ensuring the BJP’s victory. As per estimates, OBCs constitute about 40-50% of UP’s population. Yadavs make upAdvertisement
around 8-10% of the state’s population. Akhilesh thus needs to expand the base of his party beyond its traditional core supporters, Yadavs, to include other OBC communities too.
Dalits also constitute a sizeable population in UP at around 20%, who have traditionally been the BSP’s
loyalists. Akhilesh has also been trying to reach out to a section of Dalits, who might have got demoralised by the party’s decline over a long period.
BJP and INDIA bloc
While Akhilesh has been trying to champion the cause of the PDA, the BJP seems to be confident thatAdvertisement
the UP voters would not “fall for such gimmicks”. The state BJP leaders point out that Akhilesh has tried such claims on multiple occasions but it has not helped him clinch the polls. “SP is harping on PDA, but people of UP know that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has delivered on his promises and will continue to do so,” said a BJP leader.
UP Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, a prominent backward leader, has repeatedly taken on Akhilesh over his PDA pitch. He recently dubbed the PDA as the “Personal Development Authority”, charging that it was only meant to “benefit Akhilesh Yadav”.
The BJP leaders say that in its campaign for the Lok Sabha polls the party will highlight Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “fulfilment of various guarantees including the one to build the Ram Temple in Ayodhya”.
The SP’s task is thus cut out as it gears up to take on the BJP’s juggernaut in the state in the polls. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, when the SP had fought in an alliance with the BSP, the BJP had again swept the polls, bagging 62 seats as against the SP’s 5 and the BSP’s 10.Advertisement
The SP has also been facing troubles on the alliance front with its seat-sharing negotiations with its INDIA bloc ally Congress running into turbulence. Despite making some headway in their talks, the leaders of both parties do not seem to be certain that they would eventually contest together as INDIA allies in the state.",politics
Five takeaways from Modi’s last speech in 17th LS: eyeing hat-trick to flagging Cong’s free fall,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi set the tone for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections by going after the Opposition in the Lok Sabha on Monday while replying to the debate on the President’s address to Parliament.
PM Modi not only highlighted the achievements of his government but also attacked the Congress party over a range of issues including dynasty politics, corruption and apathetic governance. He exuded confidence about getting his third term in office.
Here are five important takeaways from what could be the PM’s last speech in the 17th Lok Sabha:
BJP’s 370 seats, NDA’s 400Advertisement
PM Modi said he would return to power at the head of the BJP-led NDA government for the third consecutive term
Also Read | As PM Modi delivers last speech to 17th Lok Sabha, what he said at the start of House
to set the tone for the country for the next 1,000 years. “I can gauge the mood of the nation, it will definitely give NDA more than 400 seats and the BJP at least 370 seats. And it’s not very far. At most, 100-125 days are remaining,” he said. “Abki baar,” Modi said to the chants of his MPs, “ab ki baar 400 paar.”
While the BJP has already been preparing for the polls with an aim to reach this goal, the PM underlining it on the floor of the Lok Sabha will energise party cadres. Modi’s assertion also seemed to be a bid to make the 2024 poll outcome a “foregone conclusion”.
Congress in a shambles
PM Modi mocked the Congress over its plunging electoral fortunes. “For several decades you (Congress) were sitting here (in the Treasury benches), but now you have resolved to stay there (Opposition benches) for several decades,” he said. “The people will bless you and keep you there. You will achieve greater heights and will be soon seen in the public galleries (of the House),” he added.Advertisement

The PM also said that many in the Opposition have “lost the courage” to fight elections, so some are trying to change their seats while others want to come to Parliament via Rajya Sabha.
Modi’s blistering attack on the Congress, which was recently routed in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, was also aimed at projecting the point that there is no alternative to the BJP at the Centre.
Cong’s ‘cancel culture’
PM Modi accused the Congress of having allegedly adopted a “cancel culture”. He said: “Congress is trapped in ‘cancel culture’, it seeks to cancel every achievement and success of the country… We say Make in India, Congress says cancel; we say Aatmanirbhar Bharat, Congress says cancel; we say Vocal For Local, Congress says cancel, we say Vande Bharat train, Congress says cancel; we say new Parliament building, Congress says cancel. I am surprised because these are not Modi’s achievements, these are the achievements of the country.”

The PM’s statement could be seen as an attempt to take the wind out of the Congress’s criticism of the government over its development claims, painting the Opposition as one that does not take pride in the country’s achievements.
Dynasty politicsAdvertisement
PM Modi again took on the Congress for practising dynasty politics centred round the Gandhi family. Flagging dynasty politics, corruption and failure in governance as the Congress’s key ghosts of the past, he blamed the party for the plight of the Opposition. “It was a time when the country needed constructive Opposition… But the Congress has failed to be a good Opposition and it did not let other parties also to become one. The party did not let other bright leaders to come up. The Congress has done so much damage to itself, the Opposition, Parliament and the country,” Modi said.
This sharp attack comes as the Congress tries to cobble a coalition against the Modi-led BJP, an effort that has threatened to unravel with Nitish Kumar, one of its prime architects, crossing over to the BJP and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee raising her pitch against the party.
Explained | PM Modi says Nehru, Indira had a low opinion of Indians: Which speeches was he referring to, what did the former PMs say?
The PM also tried to address the Opposition criticism of the BJP too indulging in dynasty politics. According to him, Parivarwad is when a party is led by and solely trusts in one family. “Neither Amit Shah or Rajnath Singh have a political party,” he said.
UPA’s policy paralysis
While reiterating that his government has “filled the ditches” left by the Congress-led UPA government in the past, the PM said his third term would witness India becoming the third largest economy in the world. He took swipes at the Congress by quoting the interim budget speech of former finance minister P Chidambaram in 2014 in which he said the country’s GDP would become the third highest in 30 years.Advertisement
The PM then listed the targets achieved by various schemes of his government and the time it would have taken to achieve the same under the Congress. He thus tried to showcase his government’s decisive and speedy roadmap as compared to the alternative that the electorate would have in the 2024 polls.",politics
Today in Politics: Will Congress avoid the ‘binary trap’ as PM Modi steps up attack?,"Almost two weeks ago, at a public event in UP’s Bulandshahr, this is what Prime Minister Narendra Modi had to say about media reports speculating he would blow the poll bugle from the stage. “Modi never needed to blow the election bugle. For Modi, the people themselves blow that bugle. And when they do so, Modi does not have to spend his time blowing the election bugle. He sits at the feet of people and works for them with ‘sewa bhaav (spirit of service)’,” he said.
But in Parliament on Monday, the PM used the occasion of replying to the President’s address, arguably his last speech in the 17th Lok Sabha, to launch a fierce attack on the Congress and unequivocally spell out his party’s Lok Sabha election target. “I can gauge the mood of the nation, it will definitely give NDA more than 400 seats and the BJP at least 370 seats,” he said.

Modi singled out the Congress and the Gandhis during his 90-minute speech, hardly bringing up the INDIA bloc that he has attacked as a “ghamandia (arrogant) alliance” in the past. This, as a Congress leader explained to Manoj CG, is meant to “reinforce the Congress-BJP binary, the UPA-NDA binary”. It is something that has worked to the PM’s advantage in the last two parliamentary elections. Another Congress leader told Manoj that since the Congress and the BJP would be in a “direct fight in almost 200 constituencies in the Hindi heartland and a state such as Gujarat”, the PM “has to demolish the Congress and its leadership, especially Rahul”.Advertisement

As Rahul continues with his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra — it will move from Jharkhand to Odisha’s Biramitrapur in Sundargarh district on Tuesday evening — he and the Congress face a crucial challenge. They will not only have to negate the PM’s attempts to make the election just about them, thus avoiding the “binary trap”, but they will also have to establish that the election is bigger than just Modi and Rahul or Congress and BJP. So far, the Congress has stuck to the message, taking on the PM on his governance record and livelihood issues.
But with the PM setting the tone for the Lok Sabha polls — senior leaders such as J P Nadda and Amit Shah chaired some key state meetings last week, and the BJP’s National Council may meet in the middle of this month — the Congress and its allies have to expedite seat-sharing talks and poll preparations on the ground.

Uttarakhand UCC Bill likely to be tabled

"Framing LS poll battle, why PM Modi gave Congress undivided attention in House speech","With general elections just around the corner, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday turned to his preferred foe Congress, making the grand old party the centrepiece of his attack in his last full-fledged speech in Lok Sabha before the polls. The framing was all too familiar, from finding fault from Jawaharlal Nehru to Indira Gandhi and lampooning Rahul Gandhi who is the embattled Opposition party’s last and constant hope.
It was as if Modi wanted the Lok Sabha elections to be framed as a battle between the BJP and the Congress, a political rival he has convincingly defeated twice in parliamentary elections and in countless state polls since 2014. The BJP has struggled to defeat regional parties in state elections — an exception being the Samajwadi Party (SP) in Uttar Pradesh — but has managed to trounce the Congress with ease. The BJP hence perceives the Congress as the weakest link in the alliance.
The Prime Minister’s political attack was sharp, not necessarily fresh. What stood out was his conscious omission of regional parties, most of them the BJP’s rivals. He hardly named any but focused all his jibes, barbs, and attacks at the Congress. He called the Nehru-Gandhi family a “shahi parivar (royal family)” without, of course, naming Rahul Gandhi, accused the Congress of trying to relaunch the same “product” again and again, and came down heavily on dynastic politics.Advertisement

In an apparent response to Gandhi’s oft-repeated phrase “mohabbat ki dukaan (shop of love)”, Modi said the Congress “shop” was facing closure because of its proclivity to launch the “same product again and again”. He did make a veiled mention of the INDIA alliance but again with a veiled jibe at Rahul. “Kuch din pehle Bhanumati ka kunba joda … phir ekla chalo re karne lag gaye (They cobbled together a coalition a few days ago, but now are walking alone). The Congress people have learnt the job of a motor mechanic. So, they must have learnt about alignment. But I am seeing that the alignment of the alliance has deteriorated (bigad gaya),” he said.
The PM was seemingly referring to Rahul’s visit to a bike mechanic shop in Karol Bagh last year. “The Congress got stuck with one family. They could never see and would never be able to see people’s aspirations and achievements. The Congress never trusted India’s potential. They always considered themselves rulers and belittled people,” he said.
But why this sharp attack on the Congress? Congress leaders said the Prime Minister perhaps wants to project the party as his main challenger although the ruling party is up against regional parties in some states. They were surprised by the fact that Modi did not focus much on the INDIA alliance. Speaking in the House in August last year, he called the bloc a “ghamandia (arrogant)” alliance in which “everyone wants to be the groom”.
Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge posted on X, “The Prime Minister cannot sleep without mentioning the name of Congress. He spoke about nepotism, our leaders have sacrificed their lives for the country. I want to ask Modi ji, who from your party or your political ancestors sacrificed their lives for India’s freedom, unity, and integrity?”Advertisement

“It was virtually his Lok Sabha poll campaign launch speech. And it was clear that he wanted to reinforce the Congress-BJP binary, the UPA-NDA binary. He mentioned the corruption charges faced by the UPA government … he talked about (Jawaharlal) Nehru, Indira Gandhi, and the Congress’s so-called treatment of social justice icon Karpoori Thakur because we are talking so much about caste census and OBC representation. It is clear that he wants to frame the election as a contest between the Congress and the BJP,” said a Congress leader.
“In a national election, people still see the Congress as the challenger to the BJP. While some states may be an exception, it will largely be a battle between the two sides. So he has to demolish the Congress and its leadership, especially Rahul,” said another leader, pointing out that the Congress and the BJP would be in a direct fight in nearly 200 seats in the Hindi heartland and a state such as Gujarat.
“The Prime Minister kept on attacking and criticising the Congress. He has proved that he is scared of the Congress. He spoke about 370 seats for the BJP and 400-plus seats for the NDA … Despite such bravado, he somehow seems to feel that the Congress alone can challenge the BJP. It was an out-and-out electoral speech. The sanctity of the President’s address and the debate on it required a dignified response. It was not to be,” said Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury.
Another Congress leader, however, argued that the PM’s speeches had always reflected the clash of two ideas that began in 1947. “The two ideas represented by the Congress and the RSS. It has always been there and will continue to play out. The Sangh could never forgive Nehru for turning India into a secular state unlike Islamic Pakistan after Partition … and that bitterness always flows. The opposing idea to that is offered, it can be argued, with little electoral success by only the Congress,” he said.",politics
TN Congress divisions in the open with campaign to drop Karti Chidambaram from Sivaganga,"The Congress is facing significant internal pushback in Tamil Nadu over the candidacy of Sivaganga MP Karti Chidambaram for the coming Lok Sabha elections. A section of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee’s (TNCC) Sivaganga unit, including former Union Minister E M Sudarsana Natchiappan and senior leader K R Ramasami, have endorsed a resolution appealing to the Congress high command not to give the ticket to Karti this time from Sivaganga.
The resolution against Karti, former Union Finance Minister P Chidambaram’s son, was passed at a meeting on February 3 attended by Natchiappan and others from the Sivaganga unit. Leaders close to the MP expected it as Natchiappan opposed Karti’s candidature in 2019 before changing his mind and backing the campaign. Last month, the TNCC sent a show-cause notice to Karti for saying that no Congress leader, including Rahul Gandhi, could match Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s propaganda skills, a statement that ruffled feathers in the party. Karti made the remarks in an interview to Tamil news channel Thanthi TV, with his implicit critique of the Congress leadership and inadvertent praise of Modi’s capabilities drawing the ire of the party’s disciplinary committee.
“The TNCC stock and barrel — leaders and the cadre, including party men in Sivaganga — feels that Karti should not get tickets this time for his criticism of Rahul and the Congress leadership. A Congressman cannot accept what he said,” said a TNCC leader. This sentiment reflects broader discontent with the MP’s outspokenness and its perceived negative impact on the party’s image and unity.Advertisement

Congress insiders said Natchiappan’s initiative illustrates a concerted effort by a faction within the party to push the leadership to reconsider Karti’s nomination despite his significant victory margin in the previous Lok Sabha elections against the BJP’s H Raja.
Despite this internal opposition, some top party leaders said the seat had been “reserved” for Karti. “There was opposition in the past, too, but ultimately overridden by the party’s high command due to the enduring influence of the Chidambaram family within the Congress hierarchy. This time also Chidambaram is expected to leverage his clout to secure his son’s political future, potentially with the backing of senior leaders such as Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh, even if Rahul refuses to favour Karti,” a senior TNCC leader told The Indian Express.
Sources said the internal dispute was also complicated because of Natchiappan’s ambition of contesting from Sivaganga. “Everyone knows that Rahul Gandhi is not very happy with Karti despite his respect for Chidambaram. Natchiappan is exploiting this scenario to his advantage,” said a leader.
Adding to the complexity is the stand of the Congress’s ally DMK, which is said to have expressed reservations about Karti due to his controversial remarks.
Karti and Natchiappan were not available for comments.",politics
Chhagan Bhujbal’s resignation bid over Maratha-OBC quota row brings Shinde govt rifts to the fore,"Maharashtra minister and leader of Ajit Pawar-led NCP faction, Chhagan Bhujbal’s disclosure about his resignation from the Eknath Shinde Cabinet to protest the state government’s bid to facilitate the Maratha reservation under the OBC category has put the Shinde dispensation in a spot.
Bhujbal’s move has brought the internal rifts within the ruling alliance – which includes the Shinde-led Shiv Sena, BJP and the Ajit Pawar NCP – to the surface over the Maratha quota issue.
Addressing an OBC rally at Ahmednagar on Saturday, Bhujbal said he had already submitted his resignation on November 16.Advertisement
The revelation made by Bhujbal, considered a prominent OBC leader, sent the ruling coalition in a tizzy, although Deputy CM and senior BJP leader Devendra Fadmavis immediately told reporters that Bhujbal’s resignation had not been accepted. “CM Shinde will be able to clarify on it,” Fadnavis said.
On Monday the Rashtriya OBC Mahasangh president Babanrao Taywade warned the Shinde government not to accept Bhujbal’s resignation. The OBC organisations across Maharashtra have rallied round Bhujbal for championing the cause of the OBCs over the reservation row.
“Bhujbal should continue as a minister. He is fighting for the OBC rights, raising their concerns. The government should not accept his resignation at any cost. If Bhujbal is out of government it will lead to serious consequences as OBCs will unite and take to the streets,” Taywade said.

On his part, Bhujbal said, “My priority is OBC welfare. I will continue to fight for their rights and justice. Whether I remain a minister or not is not important.”Advertisement
Bhujbal vs Jarange Patil
Earlier, Bhujbal had slammed Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange Patil for allegedly unleashing his protesters to target OBC leaders.
Last October, the Maratha quota stir took a violent turn when protesters torched the premises of NCP MLAs Prakash Solanke and Sandeep Kshirsagar. Bhujbal visited them after the violence. He also attacked Jarange Patil for trying to force the government to concede his demand for blanket issuance of Kunbi certificates to enable reservation for Marathas within the OBC category.
Jarange Patil also hit back at Bhujbal, even as several Maratha activists and Shinde Sena leaders demanded Bhujbal’s sacking as a minister.
Bhujbal has maintained that he is not against the Maratha reservation but only against facilitating “backdoor entry” of Marathas into the OBC quota through the use of the Kunbi certificates.Advertisement
On January 27, the Shinde government issued a notification of draft rules to allot Kunbi (OBC) certificates to Marathas which carried the word “sage soyare” (family relatives) as demanded by Jarange Patil.
Bhujbal has led the OBC’s opposition against it, saying it will compromise the OBC quota by reducing its existing 27% share.
Ramifications of Bhujbal moves
Taking the lead to spearhead the OBC protests against the Maratha reservation from its category, Bhujbal has addressed various rallies held in different parts of the state in recent months. This has been seen as his bid to reassert his leadership within the OBC group, which is estimated to make up about 52% of the state’s population.
Bhujbal, 76, started his political career in the Shiv Sena in the 1960s. From an ordinary sainik to the Sena corporator to becoming the Mumbai mayor twice to getting elected as the MLA from Mazgaon in 1985 and 1990 – he rose the political ladder in the Sena under the leadership of the party founder Bal Thackeray.Advertisement
Decode Politics |  As OBC protests swell over Maratha quota, why BJP has most to lose
In 1991, Bhujbal left the Sena to join the Congress, citing the Mandal politics since the Thackeray-led party was opposed to the OBC quota.
Later, when Sharad Pawar walked out of the Congress to form the NCP in 1999, Bhujbal followed him. He served as the Deputy CM twice, holding portfolios like Home and Public Works Department in the Congress-NCP governments.
Bhujbal has been representing the Yeola Assembly constituency in Nashik district in north Maharashtra as an NCP MLA since 2004.
Bhujbal faced allegations of corruption and money laundering in the Maharashtra Sadan construction case that led to his imprisonment from 2016 to 2018.Advertisement
In 2019, the Uddhav Thackeray-led Sena joined hands with the Congress and the NCP to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, with Bhujbal inducted into the Uddhav Cabinet as the Food and Civil Supplies Minister. In July 2023, when Ajit Pawar led his NCP group to join the ruling NDA coalition, Bhujbal followed Ajit and got the same portfolio.
By forming a social outfit Samata Parishad in 1992, Bhujbal had sought to establish himself as the OBC leader. However, his bid to claim the leadership of the entire OBC category, which comprises 300 communities, has often been challenged as he belongs to the Mali community, which is not considered a dominant OBC group.
By latching on to the Maratha quota issue now, Bhujbal has stepped up his attempt to emerge as the face of the OBC leadership in the state.
Interestingly, within the NDA coalition, Bhujbal’s latest OBC play is perceived as having the backing of the BJP, which does not want to antagonise OBCs, its principal vote bank, in the election year.Advertisement
On the other hand, by ensuring the issuance of the draft notification Shinde has sought to burnish his credentials as a Maratha leader. Marathas constitute about 33% of the state’s population, which are divided in its loyalty between the NCP, Congress and the Sena.
The conflict between Marathas and OBCs over quota is likely to have a bearing in the upcoming Lok Sabha and the Assembly polls in the state.
Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) president Prakash Ambedkar said, “The reservation is going to be a major issue and nobody can undermine it. The Maratha versus OBC polarisation is a reality.”
Commenting on the Bhujbal matter, he said, “Irrespective of whether anybody has resigned or not, the differences within the Cabinet over Maratha and OBC reservation are evident.”Advertisement
The MVA parties have dismissed Bhujbal’s resignation as a “drama”, with some Opposition leaders even charging that it was a “ploy orchestrated by BJP”.
State Congress president Nana Patole said, “If Bhujbal has resigned, what is his standing in the Cabinet? CM and Deputy CM should explain.”",politics
"BJP RS MP from UP again seeks repeal of Places of Worship Act, says ‘arbitrary’","Addressing the Rajya Sabha during Zero Hour, BJP MP Harnath Singh Yadav on Monday demanded repeal of the Places of Worship Act, 1991, that mandates maintaining the character of every place of worship as it was in 1947, with Ayodhya being the sole exception.
“The Places of Worship Act is completely illogical and unconstitutional. It takes away the religious rights of Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains under the Constitution. It is also hurting communal harmony in the country. Therefore, I urge the government to immediately repeal this law in the interest of the nation,” he said.
Yadav claimed that the law, with what he saw as an arbitrary cut-off date, violates the right to equality and freedom of religion as guaranteed in the Constitution.Advertisement
The statement comes at a time when Hindu worship has begun in a cellar of Varanasi’s Gyanvapi mosque, and there are petitions for the handing over of the mosque, as well as the Shahi Idgah in Mathura, to Hindus. A recent Archaeological Survey of India report has said that there existed a Hindu temple where the Gyanvapi now stands.

The RSS and BJP have been largely silent on the issue, with sources in both saying that the courts will resolve the matter and there was no plan for any movement on either of them.
Speaking to The Indian Express later, Yadav, a BJP MP from Uttar Pradesh, said that he had not spoken or written to the party about the matter.
“When this Act was brought in 1991, the BJP had opposed it strongly. Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj opposed it. So, it is clear the party is against it. The PM said yesterday at an event that those people who stayed in power for long could not understand the importance of religious places and created an atmosphere where people are ashamed of their own culture for narrow political ends. He also said that no nation can progress by forgetting its past and getting disconnected from its roots. So, against this slave mentality, and against constant attempts at driving a wedge between Hindus and Muslims, I raised this in the Zero Hour, as time is now ripe in Amrit Kaal, when Modiji is in power, to move towards this change,” Yadav said.Advertisement
“I also appeal to Muslim brothers that Ram and Krishna were their ancestors too, that they should respect and revere them. So, in the interest of national unity, which the Congress tried to disrupt, they should now willingly offer these sites to Hindus. Since the Congress came to power, they made many laws that drive a wedge between Hindus and Muslims to get votes and to humiliate Hindus. Through this Act, they gave the stamp of official sanction to temples that were demolished by invaders.”
Asked whether demolishing a mosque now on the grounds that there once existed a temple at the site would not violate the religious freedom of those Muslims who offer namaz in that mosque, Yadav said, “The BJP under Modi ji thinks about 140 crore Indians and is working to uplift them without discrimination. Muslim leaders never think about unemployment or poverty of Muslims. They just want to excite passions. That is why I appeal to common Muslims to hand over these sites to Hindus.”
Last year too, Yadav had given notice to introduce a Private Member’s Bill on the matter in the Rajya Sabha, but was absent when his name was called.",politics
What PM Modi said in his final speech at the end of the last Lok Sabha: A full-majority govt carries weight,"As Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses the 17th Lok Sabha for the last time today, before this year’s general elections, here’s a look at what he had said in his last Lok Sabha speech on February 13, 2019, before the Lok Sabha polls.
Beginning his speech by thanking the then Speaker Sumitra Mahajan and then Parliamentary Affairs Minister, the late Ananth Kumar, claiming that the world had begun taking India seriously after the people had voted in a full majority government in three decades. He said, “When a leader with complete support meets another leader of a nation, he/she knows that the former has a mandate. This has a separate weight. I have experienced for all the five years that the credit for the position that India has secured today goes not to Modi or Sushmaji but to the decision of 125 crore Indians in 2014.”

Focus on women’s participation
He complimented MPs of all parties for their productivity, pointing out that the 16th Lok Sabha had witnessed the highest number of women MPs, a large number of whom were first-timers, as well as the highest number of women Cabinet ministers and the have two women ministers in the Cabinet Committee on Security. These were meant to embellish this claim that India’s self-confidence was at an all-time high, giving impetus to development that had made India the 6th largest economy, close to becoming $5 trillion in size.
Global achievementsAdvertisement
Mentioning India’s achievements in various sectors like energy, digital technology, space and manufacturing, the PM claimed that India’s effort in the form of the International Solar Alliance was taken to mitigate the menace of global warming.
The PM said, “It is good news for each one of us that during the last four and a half years, during that tenure, India has become the world’s sixth largest economy. This has been a great achievement of this tenure and we all are partners in the same. The policies have directed us towards becoming a trillion dollar economy and the work done by our House has played a major role in helping the nation grow at a faster rate.”
Delving into India’s foreign policy achievements as displays of its soft power, the PM said that in the previous five years, India had played a big role in humanitarian activities across the globe, while yoga had become recognised globally and many countries were celebrating Ambedkar and Gandhi Jayantis.
Tough on corruption
He went on to delve into his government’s firm stand against black money and corruption with the passage of stringent laws like the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act. He also took credit for having legislated amendments to the Enemy Property Act and the passage of GST, claiming that the process of its implementation had revealed a “spirit of cooperation and bipartisanship”.Advertisement
Modi also spoke about his government’s initiatives like Aadhaar, EWS reservation, maternity benefit, etc. He said that in a major initiative, over 1,400 redundant laws had also been scrapped during the 16th Lok Sabha, before concluding his speech in a lighter vein, describing his apprehensions as an ingenue MP in his early days at the Lok Sabha, and how much he had learnt from seasoned MPs.",politics
"As PM Modi delivers last speech to 17th Lok Sabha, what he said at the start of House","On June 25, 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the newly elected Lok Sabha in his reply to the Motion of Thanks on the President’s address to the House.
Excerpts from his address:
‘Voter tested us… then gave us strong mandate’
… Nearly 60 Hon’ble Members of Parliament participated in this discussion… I am grateful to everyone, including Mr Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary, Mr T R Baalu, Mr Dayanidhi Maran… Ms Mahua Moitra… Mohammad Azam Khan, Asaduddin Owaisi… for making this discussion meaningful.

It is true that we all are humans and the influence of the last 30 days still lingers… Therefore, a little impact of the election speeches was still visible here… After several decades, the nation has given out a strong mandate. They have once again voted the same government to power with greater strength… every Indian can feel proud of the fact that our voter is so aware. The voter loves the nation more than himself and takes decision for the nation…Advertisement
Don't miss | ‘Congress promoting cancel culture, wants to cancel everything from Atmanirbhar Bharat to Vande Bharat’: PM Modi in Lok Sabha
In 2014, the nation gave us one opportunity as an experiment to come out of the circumstances. But the mandate of 2019 was given out by examining us in every way possible. They have tested us and understood us and only on that basis have once again voted us to power. This is the greatest strength of democracy…
I don’t think about winning or losing. My thoughts go beyond it… We have always worked with the spirit that those who have no one have government beside them… After Independence, we have inadvertently accepted a culture and have let it spread wherein the common man had to overcome a lot of hurdles and challenges in the system to avail his rights. I am not accusing anyone, but shouldn’t the common man be provided his rights by the system in a hassle-free way?…
‘Why no Bharat Ratna for Narasimha Rao, Manmohan Singh?’
Many new things have been told here. A few harsh things have also been said that reflect the election mood… However, we cannot make the mistake of saying that ‘no one can demean our power’ that was said here. We cannot waste our time demeaning anyone… You be happy with your loftiness. You are floating so high that you are unable to see the ground and have been detached from the roots… Therefore, your high-headedness is good for me. I hope you remain the same…
It is true that a few people are used to being praised and mentioned. Not being mentioned is taken as an insult by them… I can challenge that they have not praised Atalji’s (Atal Bihari Vajpayee) government or mentioned his good initiatives even for once. Leave Atalji, they haven’t even praised the P V Narasimha Rao government. Moreover, have they mentioned anything about Dr Manmohan Singhji in the speech now? I am nothing compared to those great people!… But you can verify: from the Red Fort, I am the first Prime Minister who said twice that every Central and state government since Independence has made contribution to the country’s development…Advertisement
Sanjaya Baru writes | Bharat Ratna: Was Karpoori Thakur’s contribution to nation building greater than that of Narasimha Rao?
This is a part of our mindset… Narasimha Raoji should have received Bharat Ratna award during his tenure; Manmohan Singhji should have received Bharat Ratna award after his first term… But people outside ‘the family’ never receive anything. But we are different. We have never worried about the party to which Pranab da (Pranab Mukherjee) belonged or for which party he had worked. Our decision to confer Bharat Ratna award on him was purely on the basis of his contribution to the nation…
‘Why should $5 trillion economy not be dream’
We too could have celebrated our victory. But we did not choose that path. We could have thought of resting for a while after six months of election preparedness, but we don’t like that… We have worked without getting involved in politics and without considering any event as a government event…
In the same House, when India had risen up from 13th to 11th position in terms of economy, there was a great enthusiasm and benches were tapped. It was projected as a great achievement. But now as India has improved to 6th position, the enthusiasm was lost…
How long will be so lofty that we are unable to see the ground? Why shouldn’t a 5 trillion dollars economy be the dream of all of us?…
We need to find ways whereby India can enter the group of top five economies, exports are increased, Make in India is promoted further and the youngsters in the realm of start-ups are encouraged. We need to promote ‘Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Jai Vigyan and Jai Anusandhan. We need to ensure employment opportunities for the youth…Advertisement
‘Not Emergency that we will put all in prison… Judiciary’s job’
We will continue with our fight against corruption. We are being rebuked for not putting a few people in jail. This is not Emergency period that we will put anyone in prison. This is democracy. The judiciary is there to do this task. We work lawfully… Whatever we do. we will be doing it with honesty. We will not do anything with bitter feelings against anyone…
I won’t take long but with respect to Gandhi-150 and Independence-75… I would say, for some reason, everything was centered around rights. Everyone was concerned with rights. This is an opportunity whereby we can ensure a paradigm shift within the country by carrying it towards duties from rights…
“In today’s modern materialist world where conflicts are seen everywhere, everyone talks about their rights and convenience; one rarely talks about the duties. This is the reason for the conflicts. This is the reality. We fight for rights and facilities only, but if we forget the duties in doing so, then these rights and facilities will not be left to us.” It is our responsibility to commemorate that great personality who said these words… That great personality said these words on 14th July, 1951, when the Congress manifesto was released before the elections. At that time, the great personality, Pandit Nehru, read this one paragraph during the announcement.
Can we move ahead with the dream of Pandit Nehru of 1951 and ensure its fulfillment?…Advertisement
Come let us move beyond the boundaries of politics for building a New India and a modern India. The nation is bigger than politics. The nation is bigger than any political party.

"After saying he was leaving politics, TDP Guntur MP Galla Jayadev heaps praise on PM Modi","In stark contrast to his and his party’s sharp attacks on the Narendra Modi government since 2018, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) Guntur MP Galla Jayadev on Monday showered praises on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his “stewardship” in taking the country to new heights.
In what he termed as his last speech in the Lok Sabha as he had announced a break from politics last week, the TDP floor leader said the consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya by Modi had “redefined and rediscovered our civilisation”. Jayadev, however, alleged that he was harassed as a businessman for “having an opinion that differed from the ruling party”. The MP, while announcing his break, had said “tough situations created by the state and central governments had made it difficult for him to sustain politically”.
“I compliment PM Modi ji for finally consecrating the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. The entire country is greatly indebted to him. I plan to visit the temple one day as it realises the 500-year-old dream of the Hindus. The world knows us as an ancient civilization, but I must say that the stones may be old but they have been chiselled afresh. Our civilization is born again. January 22 has redefined and rediscovered our civilization,” he said.

During the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address, acknowledged some of the achievements of GoI in the last decade under the stewardship of our Hon PM, Shri Modi ji.
India is poised to become the 3rd largest global economy. We are the fastest-growing among G20 nations. More… pic.twitter.com/eBtkN2sml1

The two-time MP’s praise for the PM comes after scathing attacks that he had launched against him in 2018, when the TDP’s relations with the NDA were sour, over the Centre’s “flawed policies” and had termed Modi’s tenure as a “saga of empty promises”.
Jayadev also said the new Parliament was imbued with the sense of “ek Bharat, shreshtha Bharat (One India, best India)” and was a testimony to the country’s great civilisational culture.
The Guntur MP said he could not resist the temptation to praise Modi even though his party was not a part of the NDA. “We are on the verge of becoming the world’s third largest economy. It is not just governance, it is the leadership that counts,” he said. The TDP had walked out of the ruling alliance in March 2018 accusing the Centre of giving a raw deal to Andhra Pradesh during its bifurcation.
Interestingly, the MP’s praise comes amid reports that the TDP is keen to return to the NDA fold and a day after his party chief N Chandrababu Naidu finalised seat-sharing with Pawan Kalyan’s Jana Sena Party in Andhra Pradesh citing delay on the BJP’s part to take a decision on joining their alliance.Advertisement
The MP also went on to list the top 10 achievements of the Modi government. “He (Modi) has made our country the fastest growing economy among G20 countries. About 25% people have been pulled out of poverty and 80% are being given free food. The credit for rolling out the Goods and Services Tax (GST) goes to Modiji. Today, Forex reserves are worth $615 billion. The push on Digital India… 46% of all digital transactions in the world take place in India. A total of Rs 34 lakh crore has been transferred through the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) and has helped curb corruption…,” Jayadev said.

Before expressing concerns over the delayed payments for the Polavaram project and Special Category Status for Andhra Pradesh, Jayadev heaped praises on the Centre for construction of roads and national highways, number of airports, various schemes, 33% reservation for women in Parliament and the “successful” response to the coronavirus pandemic. However, he also raised the issue of unemployment and cautioned the government of threats from AI, which he said may impact jobs in the services sector.
Reiterating that he was taking a break from politics, the Guntur MP said he could not sail in two boats (politics and business) at the same time due to various limitations. “I feel businessmen are an important part of the political process as they play a pivotal role in driving the economy and its growth. They should have the freedom to express themselves and take a stand against the government of the day when necessary, without fear of reprisals and attacks on their business. Parliament should ensure that law-abiding businesses are not exposed to harassment even if they don’t share the same political views. If we look at the affidavits of members, about 20% are businessmen. I am sure all of them have faced the same problems that I have faced over the last 10 years,” he said.
Jayadev, who is the managing director of the Rs 5,300 crore Amara Raja Group, said businessmen are encouraged to be a part of the political administration in the developed world as they can play an important role in helping people shape their economic destinies. “Unfortunately, in our country this means constant fear of reprisals and vendetta. To start and run a business, one has to get at least 70 approvals from various agencies and each of them can be weaponized by the party in power. This is detrimental to the Make-in-India program, the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative and defeats the purpose of ease of doing business,” he said and added that he would return like “Shri Ram did from vanavaas” when the time was right.Advertisement
The Guntur MP comes from a political family and is the son of four-time former Chandragiri MLA and Andhra Pradesh minister Galla Aruna Kumari. Educated in the US, he lived there for 22 years before returning to India and assuming charge as the managing director of the Amara Raja Group.",politics
"Bihar Congress chief: ‘Nitish given time till 12th for floor test … The way BJP operates, we have to be cautious (about our MLAs)’Premium Story","The Congress on Sunday flew all its MLAs in Bihar to Hyderabad, where the party is in power, ahead of the February 12 trust vote in the state. The party has said it is wary of the BJP’s attempts to split the party. In an interview, state Congress president and Rajya Sabha MP Akhilesh Prasad Singh talks about why the MLAs have been sequestered, seat-sharing talks in the state, and why he thinks that Nitish Kumar’s exit from the INDIA alliance “is good in a way”.
Why have you flown all the Congress MLAs in Bihar to Hyderabad?
We have to be cautious if we have to stop the (Nitish Kumar) government from winning the trust vote. There is huge anger among their MLAs. But they want to prove the majority at any cost. You must have seen in Jharkhand also that all the Opposition MLAs stayed together even after the oath-taking of the Chief Minister (Champai Soren). So, we are taking all precautions. The way the BJP operates, we also have to be cautious.
But sequestering the MLAs and taking them to Hyderabad also sends a message that the party doesn’t have trust in its MLAs.
We have complete trust in our MLAs. In fact, it was their suggestion to stay together.Advertisement

But some time ago we heard some of the Congress MLAs, seven to eight of them, were unreachable.
When I heard about that, I called all of them to Purnea (where Rahul Gandhi addressed a rally). Bhupesh Baghel had come to Bihar. So it was a false claim. When Ashok Choudhary was the state Congress president and the late Sadanand Singh was the CLP leader, they tried to break the party. But not even one Congress MLA switched sides. Yes, one or two MLCs went. Now the situation is different. I am the PCC (Pradesh Congress Committee) president.
But all the MLAs did not turn up in Purnea.
Barring one, every MLA was there. Out of 19, 18 were there. Siddarth Saurav (Bikram MLA) could not come as he was unwell.
Now that Nitish Kumar has left the INDIA bloc, you will have to rework the seat-sharing arrangement. Have the talks begun?
We will start discussions after the trust vote. You must understand who is scared. The Jharkhand CM was arrested. The Opposition has 44-45 MLAs. But the new CM was sworn in after two days. Nitish Kumar was allowed to take oath within hours after he resigned. In Jharkhand, there was uncertainty for 48 hours. When all the MLAs reached the airport to fly out, the information came that the oath would take place the next day. That is one part.
Political Pulse | As Nitish Kumar continues to shake up Bihar politics, 4 reasons why he remains JD(U)’s Pied Piper
Within three days after taking the oath, the Jharkhand government is seeking a confidence vote today (it won the vote). In Bihar, on the other hand, Kumar still has not taken the floor test. It was first said that the trust vote would take place on February 5, then changed it to the 10th and now it is said it would take place on the 12th. So who is scared and who is in a dilemma, you can understand.Advertisement
Do you think there are problems in the BJP and the JD(U) and they are not confident?
What do you think? If there were no problems, why was the floor test pushed to the 12th? In Jharkhand, we did not seek a different date.
Is the Congress confident of getting more seats under the new arrangement on seat sharing? Will there be a repeat of the 2019 formula?
The Congress will get its legitimate share. We are confident. In 2019, the Congress contested nine seats. My son contested on the RLSP (Rashtriya Lok Samta Party) symbol. So, we contested 10 seats. Now, Nitish Kumar has walked out. In 2019, Upendra Kushwaha, Jitan Ram Manjhi, and Mukesh Sahani too were there. All of them are not with us. So, we have to rework the arrangement.
Are you trying to bring back Kushwaha or Manjhi?
It is natural to bring all those who are against the BJP. Hum logon ki kunba bada ho (May our clan grow).
Does that include Kushwaha?
Kushwaha, Manjhi, whoever is uncomfortable there. I think Chirag Paswan will also be uncomfortable there with Kumar’s re-entry.Advertisement
So, are the doors open for all of them?
Naturally, the doors are open.
Tejashwi Yadav could not attend the Purnea rally of Rahul Gandhi. The Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra will re-enter Bihar. Have you invited Tejashwi again?
On February 15, the yatra will enter Bihar. We are organising a huge rally at the Gandhi Maidan in Aurangabad. Tejashwi will come.
The exit of Nitish Kumar, the arrest of Hemant Soren, Mamata Banerjee’s decision to contest alone in West Bengal, and Bhagwant Mann’s announcement that the AAP will go on its own in Punjab — not a happy situation for the INDIA bloc.
The Congress leaders of Punjab are also not very enthused about an alliance with the AAP in the state. Like in Kerala, the Left and the Congress will contest against each other. But whoever wins will be in the INDIA alliance. Jahan gadbadi honi ho gayi. Par kuch cheez achche ke liye hota hai (Where things had to go wrong, they have. But some things happen for the good). But what happened in Bihar is good in a way.
Why are you saying that?
The same grand alliance comprising the RJD, Congress and Left had almost defeated the BJP-JD(U) in the Assembly elections. The difference in total votes was just around 5,000. Since then, the situation has changed. The people of Bihar are seeing his mental state, they understand.Advertisement
Are you confident of the grand alliance’s chances in Bihar in the Lok Sabha polls?
We will get more seats than the BJP and the JD(U). The situation is in our favour. Overall, the perception of the INDIA alliance may have dimmed a bit but in Bihar the situation is different. Rahul Gandhi’s yatra, for instance, got a huge response in four districts of Bihar.",politics
Opposition back on the drawing table in UP as BJP changes the LS poll scene with temple,"THE GRAND Ayodhya Temple ceremony has set the theme for the Lok Sabha poll battle in Uttar Pradesh, with the BJP ensuring that the discussion on it is kept alive not only outside but also the Assembly in a state that, with 80 seats, has always been crucial to who forms the government at the Centre.
On Monday, presenting this year’s budget in the Assembly, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said he was “dedicating it to Prabhu Shri Ram”. He is there in its (the budget’s) beginning, middle and the end. He is there in each and every word of it.”
The development has clearly unsettled key Opposition parties in the state – the Samajwadi Party, Congress and BSP – which were already struggling to find an answer to the BJP, which swept the last two Lok Sabha polls in the state. The delicate balance the parties are walking is clear from the fact that while they criticised the consecration as a political event, no one spoke anything against the event itself.Advertisement
The SP, which put up a good fight against the BJP in the 2022 UP Assembly elections, even if finishing way behind, is the most vulnerable on this issue given the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led SP government’s record of taking on the kar sevaks in 1990. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has dodged the issue by staying quiet on it, though senior leader Shivpal Yadav recently said that the Mulayam government’s order opening firing on the kar sevaks was driven by the need to maintain law and order.
Incidentally, two days before the January 22 consecration ceremony, Akhilesh shared a video on X that began with the chant of ‘Om Namah Shivay’ and went on to showcase the ongoing construction of a grand ‘Kedareshwar Mahadev’ temple in Etawah (the SP’s turf). Local SP leaders say it’s Akhilesh who is himself getting this temple constructed, and that it would be like the other Shiva ‘Jyotirling’ temples across the country – including the Kashi Vishwanath one, which has seen a re-emergence since the court order allowing puja in the basement of the adjacent Gyanvapi Masjid.
SP leaders say the temple will be ready by next year.
Unlike the Congress, whose political leadership pulled out of the event citing politicisation of the event, the SP kept everyone guessing till the last minute. Akhilesh first said he had not received the invite, clarifying this with: “If Lord Ram calls, I will certainly go… It is believed that a visit to a shrine happens when the Lord Himself or Herself calls.”Advertisement
At the same time, Akhilesh’s wife and SP MP Dimple Yadav said that the SP would go if invited, and added that if not now, they would certainly visit the Ayodhya temple in the future.
In another moderation, amidst the Ayodhya fervour, the party added ‘agda (upper castes)’ to the ‘PDA (Pichhda, Dalit, Alpsankhyak)’ formula it has been talking about to counter the BJP. However, SP leaders admit that with Ram cutting across caste lines, the party is not sure if its backward politics can take on Mandir just yet.
Prominent backward classes with sizeable numbers in eastern, central and western regions of UP, like Kurmi, Yadav, Lohar, Badhai, Loniya or Noniya, Rajbhar, Kumhaar, Mallah, Nishad, Koeri (Kushwaha), Jat, Gurjar, Sainthwaar, are expected to be ripe territory for the BJP post-temple.
Similarly, among the Dalit community, only the Jatavs have embraced Buddhism in large numbers, with the others such as Sonkar, Valmiki, Paasi and Dhobis followers of Hinduism.Advertisement
This is the reason why BSP chief Mayawati too welcomed the construction of the Ram Temple, and issued a statement greeting Hindus on the consecration day, though she too accused the BJP of politicising the event.
The Congress dilemma is no different. Slipping precipitously in UP, it has been trying to tap into its traditional Muslim and Dalit vote base as well as the one that has been moving away, the Brahmins, by claiming “Thakur dominance” under the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government. It has also been trying to underline that while the SP is not raising Muslim issues strongly enough, the BSP is too cowed by the cases against its leaders to take on the BJP.
Recently, as part of this change of tactic in UP, the Congress appointed a Brahmin, Avinash Pandey, as its UP in-charge, even as Ajay Rai, a Bhumihar, is its state president already.
In the month leading up to the Ayodhya consecration, the Congress also launched its ‘UP Jodo Yatra’ after prayers at ‘Shakumbhari Devi’ temple in Saharanpur, which covered mostly west UP districts where party leaders visited both Hindu and Muslim religious places. A week before the Pran Pratishtha, Rai and other senior Congress leaders visited Ayodhya for a darshan of the existing Ram Lalla.Advertisement
Some Congress leaders have talked about how it should not be forgotten that the locks at the Ram Janmabhoomi disputed site were opened under the Rajiv Gandhi-led Congress government, while the foundation-laying was also allowed by his regime – both crucial milestones in the construction of the temple.
After Varanasi, the Opposition is also staring at a temple-plus-plus effect, with puja starting in the Gyanvapi mosque basement. While it followed a court order, the administration sent a message by ensuring its implementation within hours, including cleaning of the cellar, fixing of electricity supply inside, and the transfer of idols apparently found during an ASI survey from its treasury to the basement for puja.
Incidentally, most of the Opposition has chosen not to react to the Varanasi court order allowing puja as well. Akhilesh did seek “proper procedure” following the court’s order, but refrained from saying more. Even Congress UP chief Ajay Rai who belongs to Varanasi has remained tightlipped, as has Mayawati.
The BJP too seems to officially be taking it easy on this issue, letting the Ayodhya temple fervour play out. The party has not made a statement, barring a few leaders “thanking” the judiciary.",politics
"Almost in oblivion to attracting rival leaders, Telangana Cong scripts turnaround","From being almost written off to scripting a turnaround in the recently concluded Assembly elections to leaders making a beeline seeking the party’s nomination for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls, the Congress appears to have seen a reversal of fortunes in Telangana.
Latest in the list of leaders queuing up is Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader and former deputy CM, Thatikonda Rajaiah, who resigned from the BRS on Saturday and is likely to join the Congress next week. The former four-time MLA from Station Ghanpur is said to be eyeing the Warangal Lok Sabha seat.
Rajaiah, who holds the dubious distinction of being the first minister in Telangana to be sacked, was shunted out in January 2015 by then CM K Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) for allegedly mishandling the swine flu cases in the state.Advertisement
Rajaiah also has an old association with the Congress, having begun his political career with the party. He won as an MLA from Station Ghanpur for the first time as the party’s nominee, but resigned from the House in 2011 in support of the Telangana movement and won the subsequent 2012 bypoll. He was renominated by the BRS (then TRS) in 2014 and 2018 and won both the elections.
Ahead of the 2023 Assembly elections, Rajaiah, who is facing allegations of sexual harassment from a woman sarpanch, was overlooked for the Assembly elections by KCR, who nominated Rajaiah’s bete noire Kadiyam Srihari from Station Ghanpur. He was seen as weighing his options since, and had even met Congress leader and current minister C Damodar Raja Narasimha before the polls, sparking off speculations that he was headed to the grand old party.
The other BRS leader seen as exploring the Congress is former director of Public Health and Family Welfare, and KCR’s “blue-eyed boy” G Srinivasa Rao, who hopes to contest from the Khammam Lok Sabha seat. “I have always wanted to serve people. Now, I want to join electoral politics and serve the people in Khammam,” he said, pointing out that he headed the Public Health and Family Welfare Department during the coronavirus pandemic.
Rao had made his political intentions clear when he had touched KCR’s feet and sought his blessings at a public rally.Advertisement
However, his expectations of being nominated by the BRS in the 2023 Assembly polls had also been belied. Shunted out from the department after the A Revanth Reddy-led Congress government took over the reins of the state, he is learnt to have recently approached the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) and expressed his desire to contest from the Khammam Lok Sabha seat.
Rao will, however, face a tough challenge as Deputy CM Bhatti Vikramarka Mallu’s wife Nandini has thrown her hat in the ring and expressed her wish to contest from the seat.
A former TPCC spokesperson said a host of rival leaders are in touch with the Congress. “However, a decision on their joining and subsequent nomination for the Lok Sabha polls will be taken by the high command at an appropriate time, closer to the election,” he said.
Other leaders who are reportedly seeking Lok Sabha tickets from the Congress for the coming polls include cricketer-turned-politician Mohammed Azharuddin, former MP Renuka Chowdhury, TPCC vice-president Vinod Reddy, veteran party leader and former Rajya Sabha MP V Hanumantha Rao and film producer Bandla Ganesh.",politics
"Congress’s UP woes mount, ex-Priyanka team member, religious leader now sings praises of PM","There is no end to troubles for the Congress in Uttar Pradesh ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. After INDIA bloc partner Samajwadi Party (SP) took it by surprise by unilaterally declaring candidates for 16 Lok Sabha seats, senior leader Acharya Pramod Krishnam, who has twice contested on a Congress ticket — from Sambhal in 2014 and Lucknow in 2019 — now appears to be sulking.
Krishnam, 59, who recently met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh to invite them for the foundation-laying ceremony of ‘Kalki Dham’ in Sambhal district, has been all praise for the BJP leaders since then.
Kalki, believed to be one of the incarnations of Lord Vishnu, has an ancient temple in Sambhal, which Krishnam as its ‘Peethadhiswar’ is developing into a dham (pilgrimage).Advertisement
While Krishnam maintained that his visits to the PM and Rajnath were merely to invite them for the Kalki Dham inauguration, and should not be seen as political meetings, Congress workers are worried because his statements — praising the PM for the construction of the Ayodhya Ram Temple while targeting his own party for not accepting the consecration invite — speak otherwise.

Krishnam in fact also said that Modi has “divine powers”, adding that followers of Sanatan Dharma wanted him to lay the foundation of the Kalki Dham, just like the PM had worked towards the construction of the Ram Temple.
He has also been targeting his own party for its decision to not attend the Ayodhya consecration ceremony, as well as Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Naya Yatra. He asked the party to correct its mistake in not accepting the Ram Temple invite, saying Lord Ram belongs to everyone. Then, he said that looking at the Yatra, it appeared that the Congress was preparing for the 2029 elections, not 2024.
Sources within the Congress said that while Krishnam — earlier a part of its Uttar Pradesh Advisory Council, formed to assist Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in her role as UP in-charge for the Congress — has always been vocal about expressing his thoughts, one of the reasons for his sulking could be the SP decision to declare candidates for both Sambhal and Lucknow, which Krishnam has beene eyeing.Advertisement

While the Congress has not accepted the SP list and is hoping to get at least Lucknow, this is not going to be easy.
The SP Sambhal candidate is its sitting MP from the seat, Shafiqur Rehman Barq, and in Lucknow, the party sees a better chance for itself given that it stood second from there in 2019, though Krishnam too performed well with over 1.80 lakh votes; the winner was the BJP’s Rajnath Singh. The SP has named its veteran leader Ravidas Mahrotra from there.
The 1.8-lakh votes for Krishnam were surprising given that the Congress had been decimated elsewhere in the state, winning just 1 seat (Rae Bareli, with Sonia Gandhi as candidate), with even Rahul Gandhi losing from Amethi.
His hopes of getting a ticket notwithstanding, Krishnam, 59, and originally from Sambhal, does not have a promising electoral record. While in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, he had finished fifth in Sambhal, in 2019, he had come third.Advertisement
What could hold Krishnam in good stead is his good ties with leaders of other parties, including the SP.",politics
"Ajit Pawar is hard-hearted, selfish and ungrateful, says Sanjay Raut after ‘last poll’ jibe at Sharad Pawar","Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut on Monday said Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar is a “hard-hearted” man, a day after the rebel Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader urged voters not to fall prey to the emotional appeals of his uncle Sharad Pawar in the Lok Sabha polls.
”We never thought Ajit Pawar would turn out to be such a hard-hearted man… His statement against his uncle Sharad Pawar is unbecoming of a leader like him,” Shiv Sena spokesperson Raut told The Indian Express.
“It is my last election… Such an emotional appeal will be made… Don’t know when it will be the last election,” Ajit Pawar said on Sunday while addressing a rally in Baramati, his hometown and a Pawar family bastion, in a veiled reference to Sharad Pawar.Advertisement
Raut said Ajit Pawar achieved name, fame and identity because of Sharad Pawar. ”Who is Ajit Pawar? What was he before coming into politics? I have seen him cycling on the roads of Baramati. He was non-entity then. He rose to fame all because Sharad Pawar, who backed him, supported him and groomed him,” said Raut.
Raut said Ajit Pawar had turned against the same person who was instrumental in his graph soaring to a new high. ”This only shows Ajit Pawar is a hard-hearted and selfish leader. He is a highly ungrateful person. He can go to any extent for his selfish ends. He switched sides because it suited his political convenience. He is not a loyal leader who deserved to be followed,” Raut said.
Ridiculing Ajit Pawar’s statement that Prime Minister Narendra Modi recognises him, Raut said, ”Ajit Pawar said when he welcomes the prime minister in Maharashtra, Modi recognises him and smiles. We know Modi more than Ajit Pawar does. Making such a statement is only ridiculing oneself. Ajit Pawar does not know what he is talking about. He should do some introspection.”
Raut said even if Ajit Pawar fields his party’s candidate in Baramati, Supriya Sule, who has won the Baramati Lok Sabha seat for the last three times, would emerge victorious hands down.Advertisement
”Supriya Sule has worked hard for her constituency. She has nurtured and nourished Baramati Lok Sabha seat. She has been constantly at the beck and call of her voters. We are fully confident that whoever is fielded by Ajit Pawar from Baramati seat will have no chance against Supriya Sule,” he said.",politics
"BJP’s firm focus on Maharashtra, PM Modi set to visit state, this time in NCP bastion","With the Lok Sabha elections approaching, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be in the key poll battleground of Maharashtra this month, his third visit to the state this year. Modi will be in the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) bastion of Satara that the BJP has never won. The seat is currently held by Shriniwas Patil who is in the Sharad Pawar faction of the NCP.
Modi will visit on February 19 on the birth anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji to receive the Shiv Samman Puraskar, which is awarded each year by the family that traces its lineage to the Maratha king. Rajya Sabha MP Udayan Raje Bhosale who is the 13th direct descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji is expected to share the stage with the PM at the event.
A senior BJP functionary told The Indian Express that the PM’s visit was planned to “generate political impact” and give the BJP candidate a headstart for the polls. There is also strong buzz that the BJP is keen on fielding Bhosale from Satara. A senior BJP leader said the party believes “Bhosale will be the best candidate to take on the Opposition”.Advertisement

A BJP leader involved in poll preparations said that the party has a choice of two or more candidates in select constituencies and while Bhosale is the “unanimous first choice for now” they may push for another candidate if the NCP fields current Baramati MP Supriya Sule, Pawar’s daughter, from Satara. The NCP has not so far signalled anything to that effect.
Bhosale was earlier with the NCP and worked closely with the Pawar family. He is a three-time Satara MP, winning the constituency three straight times from 2009 onwards. Ahead of the Maharashtra Assembly elections in 2019, he vacated the seat after joining the BJP. He lost the October 2019 bypoll to Patil. An image of Pawar addressing a rally amid pouring rain during the bypoll campaign became a talking point at the time and signalled the importance the NCP attaches to the seat. Bhosale became a Rajya Sabha MP the following year.

Modi visited Maharashtra twice in January. First, on January 13 he unveiled Atal Setu, the country’s longest bridge and inaugurated and laid the foundation of projects worth almost Rs 15,000 crore. A week later, he was in Solapur to inaugurate what has been billed as the largest low-cost housing project in the country and also laid the foundation of eight AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) projects worth around Rs 2,000 crore.

The PM’s frequent visits to the state since the Eknath Shinde-led government came to power in June 2022 — Solapur was his eight visit — illustrate the BJP’s attempts to leverage his popularity and his government’s development message as it attempts to win at least 45 seats from Maharashtra. The state sends the most parliamentarians to the Lok Sabha (48) after Uttar Pradesh (80).Advertisement
The BJP seemingly has the upper hand in Maharashtra at the moment since it has successfully split the Shiv Sena and NCP. But party leaders told The Indian Express last week there was still “hunger” for more. “There could be many surprises from the state ahead of the Lok Sabha polls,” a BJP leader involved in the state unit’s affairs said at the time.
Satara was a Congress stronghold from 1951 to 1991, the only exception being in 1957 when Nana Ramchandra Patil of the CPI bagged it. The state’s first CM Yashwantrao Chavan, who went on to become a Union Minister, won from Satara from 1967 to 1980. In 1996, the Shiv Sena’s Hindurao Nimbalkar won the seat but the Congress with its candidate, Abhaysingh Bhosale, clinched it back two years later. The Congress retained it till 2009.

"Today in Politics: PM Modi to address Parliament, UCC Bill set to be tabled in Uttarakhand Assembly","The newly formed Jharkhand government of Champai Soren faces a trust vote on Monday for which 40 ruling coalition legislators, who camped in Hyderabad to prevent “poaching”, reached Ranchi on Sunday night. The vote is expected to be held from 11 am onwards.
The MLAs were shifted to Congress-ruled Telangana as the state plunged into a political crisis after Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) chief Hemant Soren resigned as CM and was subsequently arrested on January 31 by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a money laundering case. A special court has allowed Hemant to participate in the trust vote.
How the numbers stack up: The ruling coalition has 47 MLAs in the 81-member Assembly after Gandey MLA Sarfaraz Ahmed quit on January 2 reportedly to accommodate Hemant’s wife Kalpana as the former CM’s arrest seemed imminent. The JMM has 29 MLAs while allies Congress and RJD have 17 and one MLA respectively. Sources said the lone CPI(ML) Liberation legislator, Vinod Singh, has also extended support to the coalition. The NDA — which includes the BJP, All Jharkhand Students’ Union, and the Ajit Pawar-led NCP — has 29 MLAs in all.Advertisement
EXCLUSIVE | Ban polygamy, exempt tribals, fix marriage age: Uttarakhand UCC draft
A trust vote will be held in neighbouring Bihar on February 12 and like in Jharkhand, the Congress, wary of attempts to break the party, has moved 16 of its 19 MLAs to Hyderabad. The BJP, meanwhile, has dismissed the Congress’s claims. The Janata Dal (United), BJP, and Hindustani Awam Morcha of Jitan Ram Manjhi, with the support of an Independent, have a clear majority with 128 MLAs in the 243-member House. More details about the Congress’s plans and the political situation in Bihar are likely to emerge on Monday.
UCC Bill set to be tabled
With the Uttarakhand Cabinet approving the draft Uniform Civil Code (UCC), the government is all set to table the UCC Bill on Monday as the special four-day session of the Assembly begins. Once implemented, Uttarakhand will become the first state after Independence to adopt the UCC. It has been operational in Goa since the days of Portuguese rule.
The UCC proposes uniform civil laws for all communities in the state, irrespective of caste and religion. It will provide a legal framework for uniform marriage, divorce, land, property and inheritance laws for the state’s citizens. The passage of the UCC Bill in Uttarakhand will mark the fulfilment of a promise made by the BJP ahead of the Assembly polls in 2022.
Why it is significant: The move assumes significance as Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has publicly stated that his government was keenly watching Uttarakhand and plans to implement it in his state too. It will serve as the template for the implementation of UCC nationally and is likely to be implemented in Gujarat too.Advertisement
BJP issues three-line whip
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday will reply to the Motion of Thanks on the President’s January 31 address to a joint sitting of Parliament. The BJP has issued a three-line whip to all its Lok Sabha MPs to be present in the House.
Modi’s speech will likely outline the government’s accomplishments and set the agenda for the Lok Sabha elections.
SC to hear AAP plea
The Supreme Court on Monday is scheduled to hear the AAP’s plea challenging the Punjab and Haryana High Court order refusing to grant an interim stay on the Chandigarh mayoral polls. A three-judge Bench headed by CJI D Y Chandrachud, and including Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, will hear the appeal of the AAP’s mayoral candidate Kuldeep Kumar. The AAP contested the polls in alliance with the Congress, which contested the posts of senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor.
BJP’s Manoj Sonkar was elected Mayor on January 30 after he bagged 16 votes against the 12 votes received by Kuldeep Kumar. Returning Officer Anil Masih declared eight votes invalid. As the angry AAP-Congress alliance alleged fraud and boycotted the electoral process for the remaining posts, the BJP also walked away with the posts of senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor.Advertisement

"Amid unease about ‘BJP bid to split party’, 16 Bihar Congress MLAs flown to Hyderabad","As 40 MLAs of Jharkhand’s ruling alliance of JMM and Congress returned to Ranchi on Sunday night, ahead of the Assembly floor test the following day, 16 of Congress’s 19 MLAs in neighbouring Bihar were flown from Delhi to Hyderabad because of fear in the party about an attempt to split it ahead of the trust vote scheduled for February 12.
Though the Janata Dal (United), BJP, and the Hindustani Awam Morcha, with the support of an Independent, have 128 MLAs in the 253-member House, a clear majority, state Congress leaders said they were wary of the BJP trying to break away legislators to deal the Mahagathbandhan a crushing blow in the crucial battleground state. Any such move would mark a massive psychological victory for the BJP and further weaken the RJD-led alliance.
“We have been hearing for some time about the BJP trying to split our party. They were first called to Delhi by the high command,” said a Bihar Congress leader. Another state Congress functionary said the party had been apprehensive about a split since Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra travelled through the state on January 29 and 30.Advertisement

From being caught in Mulayam-Mayawati tussle to Ayodhya verdict: A former UP DGP looks back on his career,"Crime, Grime and Gumption — Case Files of an IPS Officer by OP Singh

How do senior police officers navigate their role amidst tensions in government? This is among the questions raised in Crime, Grime and Gumption — Case Files of an IPS Officer, a memoir by retired IPS officer O P Singh who served as Uttar Pradesh’s Director General of Police.
The 1983-batch IAS officer narrates interesting episodes from his long police career and gives a blow-by-blow account of the time he found himself in the middle of a tussle between the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).Advertisement
When BSP leaders were incensed
After the demolition of the Babri Masjid in December 1992, a churn took place in UP politics. In the 1993 Assembly polls, the SP and the BSP came together, with Mulayam Singh Yadav becoming the Chief Minister. Singh was the Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) in Bulandshahr at the time.
At this point, a gangster named Mahendra Fauji from the Gujjar community — caste allegiance was crucial to the gangs that operated in western UP — was proving to be a challenge for the police. In April 1994, Fauji was killed in a shootout with the police. Fauji’s death, writes Singh, created a “new trouble” for him.
“I had simply performed my duty, of stopping a criminal from committing a crime and providing succour to lakhs living under fear … The Gujjar community had lent their support to the BSP, and the party had a lot of support amongst them. The party claimed that the killing of Mahendra Fauji had upset the equation,” he writes.
Singh adds that then BSP president Kanshi Ram and secretary Mayawati demanded his suspension and raised doubts about the encounter. Singh says that “he was not shattered but was definitely disappointed”, adding that despite a “massive strain on the coalition government” the CM “refused to concede the demand”. The BSP lost the Hastinapur bypoll that year and the defeat was attributed to Gujjars deserting the party after Fauji’s encounter.Advertisement
Amid all this, Mulayam gave Singh an important posting. In May 1994, Singh became the SSP of Lucknow, increasing tensions between the coalition partners. The same year, four Dalits with a criminal history were lynched in a Thakur-dominated village of Bulandshahr. The victims allegedly went to the village with the intention of committing a crime. This incident was used to put pressure on Singh.

At a press conference on June 10, 1994, Kanshi Ram and Mayawati demanded Singh’s suspension. “I had never even met Kanshi Ram and Mayawati, yet I was dragged into the political tussle between the two parties,” the former policeman writes, adding that two weeks later Mulayam met him to convey the news of his transfer as Kumbh Mela SSP. The CM, Singh writes, expressed regret. “SSP saheb, if I don’t transfer you, the BSP will withdraw support and my government will fall. We have to undergo this drill,” the former police officer quotes Mulayam as saying.
When the SP-BSP government fell
On June 2, 1995, Singh again took charge as Lucknow SSP. The same day, around 2 pm, the police department received complaints about disturbance at the Meera Bai Marg State Guest House. Singh commanded the Circle Officer, Hazratganj, and a team was dispatched to the guest house. He was later informed that everything was normal.
A couple of hours later, during a meeting with Deputy Magistrate Rajiv Kher, Singh got a message from the Principal Secretary (Home) and the DGP about “unlawful elements” present at the guest house. “Some people at the guest house complained that the BSP MLAs were being detained forcefully,” Singh writes. “The UP government was a coalition of the BSP and SP. The political climate then was thick, with the possibility that the differences between the coalition partners had gone beyond repair and the BSP had already withdrawn support to the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led government.”Advertisement
Singh remembers that Mayawati was staying in suite numbers one and two, and that he directed the officials to make sure that these suites were “doubly secure”.
“Eventually, it became clear that the withdrawal of support by the BSP had caused the piquant situation. While Mayawati was trying to protect her MLAs from crossing over to the other side, the SP was claiming that some BSP members had expressed allegiance to Mulayam but they were being detained by their leaders,” he writes.
Singh adds, “Stories and rumours ran wild all around. Sample this: at around 10 p.m., that same day, the divisional commissioner who visited the state guest house had a word with Mayawati on the intercom. She expressed her desire to have tea. The estate officer, in charge of the guest house, rued there was no cooking gas cylinder in the kitchen. A cylinder was arranged from a nearby residence. The sight of the cylinder as it was being rolled towards the kitchen area, and the grating noise caused by it, sparked a rumour that there was an attempt to set Mayawati on fire.”
The following day, Singh received a copy of a letter written by Mayawati to the Governor. The letter, which he says surprised him, alleged that SP leaders unlawfully gathered at the guest house, attacked BSP members, and also took away some MLAs with them. “As a police officer, I was again caught in the crossfire of the insidious kind between two political parties, playing their power games,” he writes.Advertisement
That night, at around 9 pm, the Governor dismissed the Mulayam government and Mayawati was sworn in as the new CM. Singh was suspended and slapped with two cases connected to the events at the guest house. The government reinstated him after 150 days and all the cases and inquiries against him were subsequently withdrawn.
Ayodhya verdict in 2019
Singh writes that the revocation of Article 370 by Parliament on August 5, 2019, was a “decision that was largely welcomed by the nation”. The same night, in a high-powered meeting on law and order, current UP CM Yogi Adityanath, Singh writes, “sounded the alarm for the UP Police regarding the Ayodhya verdict, which was ninety days away”. Singh was the DGP at the time.
“October saw the launch of an exercise to identify illegal migrants living in the state on the basis of illegal means, including through fake identities,” Singh writes. This fuelled media speculation that the National Register for Citizens had been implemented across the state like in Assam.
On October 18, Kamlesh Tiwari, the founder of the Hindu Samaj Party, a regional outfit, was killed by two Muslim men. This incident saw a flurry of activity on social media, with several making provocative statements. Singh writes that more than seventy FIRs were registered and some arrests made.Advertisement
Less than three weeks later, the top court was about to announce the Ayodhya case verdict. “Hundreds of people were detained in Ayodhya and thousands of police officers were deployed to meet up with the challenge. Social media was closely monitored to pick up unwarranted chatter. About a thousand individuals active on social media creating nuisance were marked and cases registered against them. The state went through some very tense moments right up to the declaration of the verdict. Hotspots were marked, foot patrolling and random checking became a norm.”
About the day of the SC judgment, Singh writes: “CM Yogi positioned himself in the police headquarters to monitor the situation by the second and ensure immediate decision if an emergent situation was to develop. An emergency desk was established for every zone in the state. It was a massive, calibrated police show, and it goes to the credit of the UP Police, for it yet again displayed its fortitude and efficiency.”
Singh writes that National Security Adviser Ajit Doval appreciated his role in keeping the state calm and peaceful during this period.",politics
"‘Ram temple was desire of majority, no need to protest’: IUML Kerala chief faces backlash","DESCRIBING THE newly consecrated Ram Temple in Ayodhya and the proposed mosque nearby as “symbols of secularism”, Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) Kerala president Sadiq Ali Shihab Thangal has said that there was no need to protest against the temple. The Muslim community should think about the future instead of milling around the issue, he said.
Thangal, a senior member of Kerala’s influential Panakkad family, made the address at a public meeting in Malappuram on January 24, two days after the Pran Pratishtha ceremony in Ayodhya. The address, a video of which was widely circulated on social media on Sunday, has triggered a debate in political circles.
While the IUML, an ally of the Congress, said that Thangal’s remarks were a reaffirmation of its stand for tolerance and harmony, political rivals in the community said the IUML leader has borrowed RSS language and a time would come when party sympathizers take to the streets against him.Advertisement
Referring to the Pran Pratishtha ceremony in Ayodhya, Thangal said, “A major development has taken place in our country. Ram Temple, which the majority community of the country had desired, has become a reality. The country cannot now go back. That was a necessity of the majority community in the country. We need not protest that the temple has come up in Ayodhya. In a pluralistic society, everybody has freedom to go ahead as per their faith.”

“The Ram Temple and the Babri masjid, which is under construction following a court verdict, are best examples of secularism. We should imbibe that. Both are best symbols of secularism. It is true that kar sevaks had destroyed the masjid and we had protested against it in those days. But Muslims in the country could face that situation with tolerance, especially in Kerala where Muslim community is very sensitive and active,” he said.
“When the masjid was demolished, Muslims in Kerala could show a model for the country. Then, the entire country and its political leadership looked down south to Kerala. They were keen to know whether peace was prevailing in Kerala. We never fall to provocations and temptations,” he said.
When Babri Masjid was demolished in 1992, the IUML was led by Panakkad Syed Muhammedali Shihab Thangal, eldest brother of Sadiq Ali. The senior Thangal had then appealed to the community: “Not a single stone should fall on a Hindu house. Muslims should stand guard for Hindu temples, if required.”Advertisement
The middle path of the Panakkad family and IUML in the wake of the Babri Masjid demolition had led to a split in the party with late Ebrahim Sulaiman Sait, a multiple-term MP, walking out of the party and floating the Indian National League (INL), which later became an ally of the CPI(M)-led LDF in Kerala.

Referring to the moderate line adopted by his family in 1992, Thangal said, “The political centre of Muslims had then intelligently handled the situation. Time has ratified the stand taken by the then leadership. Had the leadership adopted a different stand, the community would have had to pay a heavy price. History would have been different. Yesterday also, there were provocations and many waited. But the IUML took a stand for peace and harmony.”
Thangal said there are several historical realities about the Babri Masjid. “But certain people think that the community can be tied to the issue and made to mill around it. Future is important. We should not forget history. By imbibing that historic reality, we should think how that can be turned beneficial for the community and the minorities as well. The IUML policy is to frame the future against the backdrop of the experiences of the past,’’ he said.
Thangal’s stand on the issue drew criticism from rivals in the Muslim community.Advertisement
INL state secretary Kassim Irikkur said, “Time is not far when IUML cadres hit the streets against party president Thangal. By stating that the temple would strengthen secularism, Thangal has borrowed the language of RSS and Sangh Parivar. When the RSS has tried to stake claim over other masjids in the country, Thangal has betrayed the community. An Enlightened Kerala will give a fitting reply to Thangal.”
Senior IUML leader and party legislator P K Kunhalikutty said Thangal’s statement was with good intention. “He wanted none should fall into the BJP’s trap and the issue should not be used for political gains. The stand goes in tune with the party’s earlier stand on the masjid issue. It should not be distorted,” he said.
Senior Congress legislator and Opposition leader V D Satheesan said Thangal speaks for harmony and peace when there are attempts to foment hate. “His attempt is to prevent the issue going into the hands of extremists on both sides,” he said.",politics
Biggest face in TMC star cast: Who is MP Dev Adhikari who has resigned from 3 govt panels,"Bengali movie star and Trinamool Congress MP Deepak Adhikari, popularly known as Dev, has resigned from three committees in his constituency, triggering speculation about whether the two-term parliamentarian will contest the coming Lok Sabha election from his seat Ghatal in Paschim Mednipur district.
While Dev who is the TMC’s biggest face from Tollywood did not provide any reason for his decision, party insiders claimed that the two-time MP is reluctant to contest the Lok Sabha polls as he wants to focus on his film career. Sources indicated that the actor-turned-politician has had differences with TMC workers and leaders in his constituency over a host of issues.
In the three letters to the district magistrate on Saturday, the MP resigned as the vice-chairman of the Birsingha Development Authority, chairman of the Rogi Kalyan Samity – Ghatal SD Hospital, and president of the Ghatal Rabindra Satabarshiki Maha Vidyalaya.Advertisement
“A party MP has resigned from some posts. It is his personal decision. Before an election, one has to resign from such posts. I think he (Dev) will give an explanation on this in due time,” TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh told reporters on Sunday.
Born in Keshpur of Paschim Medinipur district, Dev made his debut on the silver screen in 2006 with Agnishapath. His breakthrough in films came with I Love You in 2007, which went on to be a huge commercial success. Despite the film faring well at the box office, Dev was without work for the next 14 months.
The following year, he made a comeback to the silver screen with Premer Kahini. However, the 2009 film Challenge catapulted him to superstardom as the movie received rave reviews from the audience as well as critics. His commercial success continued with films like Le Chakka (2010), Dui Prithibi (2010), Paglu (2011), Challenge 2 (2012), and Chander Pahar (2013).
Known to be one of the highest-paid and sought-after Bengali actors, Dev has received numerous awards for his work such as the Tele Cine Awards, Kalakar Awards, Filmfare Awards East (2017), and NABC International Bangla Film Award 2017. He has also been a mentor on a popular Bengali dance reality show, where he replaced fellow actor and BJP leader Mithun Chakraborty.Advertisement
Because of his massive fan following and superstar status, Dev was one among the handful of Tollywood actors who caught the attention of the TMC and was fielded from Ghatal in 2014. He triggered a row before the election when he compared the political attention on him to “being raped”. He later took to social media to apologise for the comment. He received more than 50% of the votes in the election, defeating his nearest rival Santosh Rana of the CPI. In 2019, he retained the seat, polling more votes than five years earlier – over seven lakh – and defeated former IPS officer and BJP candidate Bharati Ghosh.
The Ghatal MP earned the dubious distinction of recording the lowest attendance of 11% during his first stint as an MP between 2014 and 2019, during which he took part only in two debates and asked only three questions. In his second term, Dev’s attendance stood at 11% while he participated in one debate and asked 102 questions in the Lok Sabha. He has also been a part of various Standing Committees like defence, industry, and social justice and empowerment.
In 2019, his letter to then Union Railways Minister Piyush Goyal seeking a joint survey for a Road Over Bridge at a level-crossing in his constituency made news after Goyal in his reply asked the MP to suggest a new proposal, claiming his suggestions “would affect the other projects of the railways”.
For Dev, 2022 was a year of controversies. In February, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) summoned and questioned him for his alleged role in connection with a cattle smuggling case. That December, Projapati, a film starring him and Chakraborty that was a commercial success hit the headlines after it was not released in Nandan, the state-run film and cultural centre. The BJP alleged that the release was stalled as the film featured its party leader.Advertisement
Responding to the controversy, Dev told media that the movie was released in several multiplexes as well as single-screen theatres and had been receiving good response. “It would have been great if we could have got a slot in Nandan. Hopefully, my next project will get a berth there,” Dev said at the time.
In 2023, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee named the actor the state’s tourism ambassador, replacing Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan.",politics
New worry for INDIA alliance in UP: Some in RLD unhappy about seat uncertaintyPremium Story,"Even as INDIA bloc constituents Congress and Samajwadi Party (SP) walk a tightrope on seat-sharing in Uttar Pradesh, the alliance’s third partner Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) is unhappy about the lack of clarity about which seats it will be contesting. The SP and the RLD on January 19 worked out a seat-sharing agreement, with the Jayant Chaudhary-led party getting seven.
Though the RLD has refrained from commenting on seat-sharing, party leaders told The Indian Express that it would side with the SP if talks between the Congress and the Akhilesh Yadav-led party fail.
“Despite what happens between the Congress and the SP, we will continue our alliance with the SP as going with the Congress, which lacks a voter base in the state, will not be beneficial for us. Jayant ji and Akhilesh ji have refused to release which seats the RLD will get and this has resulted in some anxiety among leaders who are preparing to contest on the RLD symbol,” said a senior RLD leader.Advertisement
Another party leader said an understanding had been reached on some constituencies. “We are sure we will get Baghpat and Mathura. But for seats such as Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Nagina, Agra and Hathras, there is no certainty. Hence, the candidates there are not sure about whether to keep their options open or not,” said the RLD functionary.
But RLD national general secretary Anupam Mishra told The Indian Express that the party cadre was working on all seats and such issues do not affect them. “No matter which seats we get, we are preparing on the ground and that’s what matters,” he said.

The SP and the Congress are facing hiccups on a seat-sharing agreement. The grand old party this week said it felt blindsided after the SP announced a list of 16 candidates, some of which the Congress was expecting to get. Relations between the two parties have been tense as the SP had also “surprised” the Congress by announcing that 11 seats would be left aside for it. The Congress insists that seat-sharing has yet to be finalised. All India Congress Committee (AICC) Uttar Pradesh in-charge Avinash Pande said earlier this week that the Congress could look at “other options” and said those trying to create a “perception” against his party should know that “Congress vinamra reh sakti hai, sehyog kar sakti hai, lekin laachar nahi hai (Congress can be humble, it can give support, but it is not helpless)”.

Meanwhile, the SP played down the talk of displeasure in RLD ranks saying there is enough time to finalise which seats the RLD will contest. The party’s national spokesperson Rajendra Choudhary said the RLD was deciding its candidates and would reach a conclusion soon.Advertisement
The SP and RLD have been allies in the state since the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, when the Chaudhary-led party contested three seats as a part of the “mahagathbandhan”, of which the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) also was a part. The SP contested 37 seats, of which it won five. In the 2022 Assembly elections, the SP-RLD coalition won 120 seats. While the SP won 111 of the 347 seats it contested, the RLD won nine of the 33 seats where it was in the fray.",politics
Muslim cleric faces backlash for attending Ram Mandir inauguration: Who is Imam Umer Ahmed Ilyasi?,"The chief of an organisation that claims to represent half a million imams in the country, a man known for his proximity to the ruling BJP and the RSS, and among just a few Muslim leaders invited to the Ram Temple’s consecration event in Ayodhya on January 22, Imam Umer Ahmed Ilyasi has said that he is the target of a “fatwa” now.
Ilyasi, the chief imam of the All India Imam Organisation (AIIO) since 2009, claims that Mufti Sabir Hussain, who runs a YouTube channel, has issued a fatwa against him after he attended the Ayodhya event. However, a statement put out by Hussain has only called for a fatwa to be issued against Ilyasi for his participation in the Temple’s consecration ceremony.
Ilyasi has also alleged that he received death threats and harassing phone calls calling for his removal as the chief imam. According to his son Suhaib, the cleric has been provided Y+ security by the government since 2016.Advertisement
Ilyasi told The Indian Express he attended the consecration to express his “paigham-e-mohabbat (message of love)” and insisted his actions were motivated not by religious sentiments but by his “love for humanity”. “We are all humans first and our humanity is our character. One can only be a good Muslim or a good Hindu if one is a good person,” he said. “People can have different castes, their forms of worship can be different, our faiths can be different, but the biggest dharma should be humanity.”
Ilyasi also said he went to attend the Ayodhya ceremony as part of his “duty to the nation”. “The nation has given all so much, so we, too, must give back to the nation. We shouldn’t make Hindu or Muslim our identity but instead identify ourselves as Indian first… They say that it was wrong that I went for the Pran Pratishtha (consecration) ceremony, but I went for national interest and communal harmony,” he said.
Ilyasi, though, is undeterred by what he claims is a fatwa, saying it holds no legal weight and cannot be implemented since India is not an Islamic country.
This is not the first time Ilyasi finds himself in a spot, especially for his close ties with the Sangh Parivar.Advertisement
Ilyasi has interacted with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on several occasions, including in 2015 as part of a delegation of Muslim leaders, and has also met Union Home Minister Amit Shah. He has also had meetings with spiritual leaders such as Jagadish Vasudev, who is known as Sadhguru, and Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, among others.
On his 2015 meeting with PM Modi, Ilyasi had said, “We told the PM that while he speaks mann ki baat, we have come to tell him our dil ki baat, our concerns about how, when he was talking Make in India, some people were talking about destroying India. He told me, ‘I give you my word, if you knock on my door at 12 in the night, I will respond’. He assured us that he is responsible for every Indian.”
In June 2016, Ilyasi had also led a delegation to meet then Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, calling for peace in Jammu and Kashmir after protests broke out over civilians killed by security personnel there. “Kashmir is an integral part of India. We met Rajnath Singh ji and we proposed that we want Kashmir to make peace,” he had then said.
In September 2022, Ilyasi was among several Muslim intellectuals who met RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. After the meeting, he, however, drew flak for referring to Bhagwat as “rashtra pita (father of the nation)”.Advertisement
Questioning the RSS’s move, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB)’s member Qasim Rasool Ilyas had then told The Indian Express that if Bhagwat and the RSS really wanted to reach out to the Muslim community, they would get in touch with organisations that actually have influence and following — such as the AIMPLB or the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind or the Jamaat-e-Islami.
Several members from various Muslim organisations have pointed out that Ilyasi has “little standing” within the community. One of them alleged that Ilyasi was “not even a recognised Islamic scholar”. Another said he has always been “pro-government for the sake of benefits”.",politics
"Behind Mamata attack on Congress, fear of split in Muslim vote, bid to retain supremacyPremium Story","From taking a swipe at the Congress from her ‘Sarba Dharma (all-faith)’ rally in Kolkata’s Muslim-dominated Park Circus area on the day of the Ayodhya Ram Temple’s consecration event to targeting the party for reaching out to the minority voters during its Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra at a time when the BJP is raising its Ayodhya pitch to woo Hindus – West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo Mamata Banerjee has been making all attempts to hold on to her crucial Muslim vote bank in the state even at the expense of the Opposition INDIA alliance.
Addressing party workers in Kolkata on Friday during her sit-in protest against the Centre for “withholding” funds under various welfare schemes, Mamata said, “I asked the Congress to fight in 300 seats (and leave the rest for INDIA partners in the Lok Sabha polls), but they did not listen. Now, they have come to the state to create a stir among Muslim voters. The BJP is trying to create a stir among Hindu voters. What will secular parties like us do? I don’t know if (the Congress) will even win 40 seats if they contest 300.”
After announcing that her party would not ally with the Congress in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls, Mamata’s statement against the latter signalled that the TMC does not want a division of minority votes, which her party has cornered since coming to power in Bengal in 2011.Advertisement
On January 22, at the TMC’s all-faith rally, Mamata urged the Muslim voters not to “waste their votes” by supporting any party other than the TMC.
The previous CPM-led Left Front government in Bengal had traditionally enjoyed the support of the Muslim community. However, the 2007 case of Rizwanur Rahman, who was allegedly driven to suicide by his influential Hindu in-laws, and the Nandigram and Singur land agitations between 2006 and 2008, all of which fuelled the TMC’s rise against the Left Front, swung the Muslim vote in Mamata’s favour.
After coming to power in 2011, the TMC government further consolidated the minority vote by announcing allowances for imams, scholarships for Muslim students, creation of welfare boards, and a Rs 50-crore grant for government-recognised madrasas. Mamata also threw her weight behind the movement against the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act)-NRC (National Register of Citizens in the state that continued between December 2019 and January 2020.

Such policies were followed by her party winning election after election in Bengal. In the panchayat elections of 2018 and 2023, and the Assembly elections of 2021, minority voters returned the favour by giving the TMC their full support. This was evident in the 2021 Assembly polls when both the Congress and the Left Front failed to win any of the 294 Assembly seats despite forging an alliance, which included the fledgling Indian Secular Front (ISF).Advertisement
However, in 2023, the TMC witnessed its first electoral defeat in the state after the 2021 polls. Bayron Biswas, the Left-backed Congress candidate, won the Sagardighi Assembly bypoll in February 2023.
This bypoll assumed significance as it was held in the Murshidabad district, which has the highest Muslim population in the state at 66.28%. The result was viewed as a sign of the TMC’s eroding minority vote bank. Following the defeat, Mamata had ordered changes in the leadership of the party’s minority cell. In May 2023, Biswas also switched to the TMC.
With Mamata recently announcing that the TMC would contest the Lok Sabha polls alone in Bengal, the stage is set for a three-cornered contest, which may see the minority vote get divided between the TMC and Left-Congress alliance. The BJP is the principal Opposition in the state.
Decode Politics | Decode Politics: Why Mamata Banerjee has served Congress an ultimatum
The TMC needs to get as much support as possible from the Muslim community, which accounts for 27% of the state’s population, to counter the BJP’s Hindutva politics. The minority vote could prove crucial for the TMC as the BJP seeks to consolidate its Hindu base by banking on Hindutva and the Ram Temple.Advertisement
Of Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha seats, there are 7 that have Muslims in a majority and another 6 where the minority votes can be the deciding factor. In the 2019 polls, the TMC had won 3 of the 7 Muslim-majority seats and all 6 seats with sizeable Muslim population.
As Congress leader Rahul Gandhi brought his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra to Bengal’s Muslim-dominated Murshidabad and Malda districts, Mamata launched an all-out attack, claiming that the grand old party may not be able to win even 40 seats this time.
On Saturday, Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury hit back at Mamata. “Mamata Banerjee has been alleging that the Congress is talking about different things to get Muslim votes. The BJP is also saying that the grand old party will be weaker in the coming days, and Didi (Mamata) is saying nothing is possible by the Congress… It’s quite unfortunate to see a leader who is in the INDIA bloc say such things,” Chowdhury reportedly told media persons at the party’s Murshidabad office. “It seems that Mamata Banerjee is scared of the BJP and that is the reason she is changing her stance every day.”

State Congress spokesperson Soumya Aich Roy told The Indian Express that Mamata was indulging in “competitive communalism”. “While the BJP is seeking votes over the Ram Mandir inauguration, the TMC is doing the same over the Jagannath temple inauguration (to be held in Digha later this year). The Congress is taking out the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra against communal polarisation and divisive politics of the BJP-led NDA government. Why is she under the impression that the rally is being held to divide the people? She is attacking the Yatra to give the BJP some breathing space. In reality, she wants to divide the people along religious lines to mislead the people. She wants to keep the BJP in good humour,” he alleged.Advertisement
State BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said his party only believes in “decisive” politics. “Her (Mamata’s) brand of secularism is that she will chant ‘Jai Maa Kali’ in the morning and attend Muslim rallies in the evening. She is used to this kind of politics. The Congress, too, is no different. Her politics is divisive politics and our politics is decisive politics,” he told The Indian Express.",politics
"Today in Politics: Modi to roll out Rs 11,600 cr projects in Assam; Kharge to kick off Cong’s Kerala campaign","Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Assam Saturday on a two-day visit, where he is set to inaugurate and lay the foundation stone of various development projects worth Rs 11,600 crore, address a rally and meet the state BJP’s core committee on Sunday.
A day after he launched multiple infrastructure projects, worth more than Rs 68,000 crore, in Odisha, PM Modi will lay the foundation stones for an integrated new building of the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (Rs 3,250 crore), the Kamakhya temple corridor (Rs 498 crore), the six-lane road from the new airport terminal (Rs 358 crore) in Guwahati, the upgradation of Nehru Stadium to FIFA standards (Rs 831 crore), a new sports complex in Chandrapur (Rs 300 crore), among others.
Modi will also inaugurate the second phase of the Asom Mala roads, comprising 43 new roads and 38 concrete bridges at a total investment of Rs 3,444 crore, the newly constructed four-lane road from Biswanath Chariali to Gohpur, developed at a cost of Rs 1,451 crore.Advertisement
Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said PM Modi will also meet the state BJP’s core committee later in the day to discuss party affairs, with the Lok Sabha polls just round the corner.
Other top BJP leaders, including Union Home minister Amit Shah and party president J P Nadda, have their focus on the Congress-ruled states of Telangana and Himachal Pradesh, as Jatin Anand reported.
According to BJP sources, Nadda will chair the Himachal Pradesh BJP’s core committee meeting on February 3-4, while Shah will do the same in Telangana on February 4-5. Both leaders are holding these meetings to prepare the party’s strategy to turn the tide in its favour in the upcoming elections.
Out of 17 Lok Sabha seats in Telangana, the BJP currently holds only four, while the party has three of the four Lok Sabha MPs from Himachal.Advertisement
“All seats and states are important as far as the Lok Sabha elections are concerned; the party would focus on Telangana, where we represent only four of the 17 Parliamentary seats. Himachal is significant for the Rajya Sabha elections,” a source said.
Meanwhile, the Congress is continuing its Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra with its third day in Jharkhand on Sunday. While in Dhanbad, Rahul Gandhi will deliver a public address at the Birsa Munda Chowk before beginning a foot march in Bokaro Steel City. In the second half of the day, the Yatra will continue to Ramgarh, where there will be another public address before halting for the night.
The Yatra’s Jharkhand leg comes at a tumultuous time in state politics. After new Chief Minister Champai Soren took oath on Friday, replacing Hemant Soren who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in a money laundering case on Wednesday, the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) sent about 40 of its MLAs to Hyderabad amid fears of horse-trading.
On Saturday, a special court in Ranchi permitted Hemant, who is still an MLA, to participate in the trust vote to be held in the Assembly on Monday.Advertisement
While speaking in Godda, Rahul called the situation in Jharkhand an “injustice”. “The people of this state elected a Congress-supported government but Narendra Modi ji used ED, CBI and Income Tax department, giving them instructions to act against all those who opposed them. The BJP tried to steal the government elected by the people of Jharkhand. However, the Congress party stood firm with the people’s mandate and saved the government of Jharkhand.”
As the Yatra rolls on, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge is set to launch the party’s campaign in Kerala with a meeting with party workers on Sunday. The party is holding a Mahajana Sabha in Thrissur, where Kharge will address party workers from more than 25,000 booths from across the state. State party president K Sudhakaran, national general secretary K C Venugopal and the Assembly’s Leader of Opposition V D Satheesan will also be in attendance.
The Congress is holding a series of state-level conventions with party workers and office-bearers to be presided over by Kharge as part of its wider push across the country ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.

IAS transfers to governance classes for ministers: How Mohan Yadav is reshaping MP governmentPremium Story,"From the recent transfer of 15 IAS officers to taking a lead role in organising a leadership summit on effective governance attended by senior ministers of the BJP government, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Dr Mohan Yadav has slowly begun reshaping the new government, moving past the shadows of former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan.
Over two months after taking charge, Yadav reshuffled 15 IAS officers, of which five were appointed to the CM Secretariat. This development comes a week after the government transferred 18 IAS officers.
In the order issued on February 2, Bharat Yadav, a 2008-batch officer was made secretary to the CM, and Avinash Lavania, a 2009-batch IAS officer and managing director of MP Road Development Corporation was made his additional secretary. Chandrashekhar Walimbe, a 2010-batch officer, was also elevated as another additional secretary to the CM. Aditi Garg, a 2015-batch officer, and Anshul Gupta, a 2016-batch officer, have been made deputy secretaries in the CM Secretariat.Advertisement

A senior government official said, “This is Mohan Yadav asserting himself and picking his men. He recently appointed Raghvendra Kumar Singh, as his principal secretary and has now begun making his team. Shivraj has ruled the state for 17 years and knows the in and out of the administration. Yadav wanted to break from that and it took time to make the necessary appointments, to ensure there is a new administration in place.”
On Saturday, a two-day leadership summit was organised in Bhopal where, after the thumping win in the recently concluded Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh and in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections, the senior leaders of the BJP-ruled government took lessons on governance, stress management, and social media management.

“The purpose of the summit was learning the nitty-gritty of administration, the budget, strategies for interdepartmental coordination, and best practices for good governance. But the talking point here is that this was pushed on a state level. Yadav is interested in holding the summit to ensure the new team can gel together and get working. This did not happen under Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s tenure. For Yadav, this is a stepping stone, he is relying on experts to help his new cabinet find their footing,” said an official.
The summit was a closed-door event, which was attended by senior BJP leaders and Niti Ayog experts. After the event, Yadav said, “Decisions of the state’s Council of Ministers affect the entire population of the state. Therefore, periodic training of the members of the Council of Ministers is necessary. Training will provide an opportunity to learn the nuances of governance, which will lead to tightening administration, and its direct benefit will reach the people of the state through the decisions of the Council of Ministers.”Advertisement
Dr Vikrant Singh Tomar, who was one of the speakers at the event, told The Indian Express, “I took a session on stress management and leadership. I talked about stresses that come with the public life. I asked the ministers to find somebody to share their stress, read inspirational books, be in the company of right-minded people to feel relaxed and lastly to listen to their own conscience.”
Speaker of the Legislative Assembly Narendra Singh Tomar, Panchayat and Rural Development and Labor Minister Prahlad Singh Patel, and Urban Housing and Development Minister Shri Kailash Vijayvargiya will take the sessions on Sunday.

"With Bharat Ratna for Advani after Karpoori, BJP message for polls clear: social justice, Hindutva","Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced Saturday the government would confer Bharat Ratna, the country’s highest civilian award, on BJP stalwart and former Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani.
“I am very happy to share that Shri L K Advani ji will be conferred the Bharat Ratna. I also spoke to him and congratulated him on being conferred this honour. One of the most respected statesmen of our times, his contribution to the development of India is monumental,” Modi said in a post on social media platform X.
“His is a life that started from working at the grassroots to serving the nation as our deputy Prime Minister. He distinguished himself as our Home Minister and I&B minister as well. His Parliamentary interventions have always been exemplary, full of rich insights,” the Prime Minister said.Advertisement

The decision comes days after the award of Bharat Ratna posthumously to socialist leader and former Chief Minister of Bihar Karpoori Thakur, and the consecration of the Ram temple at Ayodhya on January 22.
The journey of the two Bharat Ratna awardees — Karpoori Thakur and LK Advani — highlights the two pillars of the BJP’s political discourse these days – social justice and Hindutva.
Advani was the BJP President when the party endorsed the Ram Janmabhoomi movement in its Palampur resolution in 1989, and was also the leader who set off the Ram temple Rath Yatra from Somnath to Ayodhya in September 1990.

Karpoori Thakur was the first leader in north India to offer reservations to both OBCs and the Extremely Backward Class in 1978. It was with the support of the Jana Sangh, the BJP’s predecessor, that he became the Deputy Chief Minister and also the Chief Minister of Bihar.Advertisement
Significantly, the two awards were announced one after the other. While social justice, the Opposition’s poll plank, was the reigning theme when Bharat Ratna was announced for Karpoori Thakur, Janta Dal (U) leader and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, the architect of the caste survey in the state, crossed over to the NDA within a few days. The conferring of the Bharat Ratna on Advani, the politician who brought Hindutva to the centre of Indian politics, is tantamount to state recognition of the centrality of Hindutva and the Ram temple movement.
The Bharat Ratna for Advani also marks a moment of closure for the veteran leader. With Prime Minister Modi seen as announcing the honour for his mentor, the message being conveyed to the electorate is that the party operates like a unit, recognising its senior leaders who are in the twilight of their political lives.

The office of LK Advani sent a statement by the veteran leader, thanking both President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Modi for conferring him the honour. “With utmost humility and gratitude, I accept the Bharat Ratna that has been conferred on me today. It is not only an honour for me as a person, but also for the ideals and principles that I strove to serve throughout my life to the best of my ability,” the statement said.
Advani recalled joining the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh at 14, and said he always thought of serving his country with dedication, and considered his life as not his but belonging to the nation. He recalled Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and also his late wife Kamla.Advertisement
From an organisation man, he rose to become the Minister of Information and Broadcasting in 1977 in the Janata Party government born out of opposition unity against the Congress. After the drubbing the BJP received at the hands of the Congress in 1984, Advani as party president aligned the BJP with the Ram temple movement, first through the 1989 Palampur resolution of the party and then through his 1990 Rath Yatra. The new Hindutva icon, who had been in the Rajya Sabha since 1970, now became a mass leader, and began to win Lok Sabha elections from Delhi and then Gandhinagar from 1989 onwards.

The rath yatra, however, also pushed him into the political wilderness after the Babri mosque demolition, as “secular” parties laid the blame on him. He willingly settled to work hand-in-hand with consensus-builder Vajpayee, who was the Prime Minister from 1998 to 2004. In 2005, Advani had to resign as BJP president when he called Jinnah “secular” in Pakistan. This was seen by critics as an attempt at projecting a moderate image gone terribly wrong. In 2009, the BJP lost miserably with Advani, now trying to be a coalition builder, as the PM candidate. The party got just 116 seats in the Lok Sabha, while the Congress won 206.
Advani did not get another shot at power. In 2013, when Narendra Modi was declared the central campaign coordinator of the BJP in Goa, Advani resigned from all party posts in a huff. His terms with Modi, whom he had once mentored and who was present with him when his Ram Rath Yatra began from Somnath in 1990, seemed to have soured. The party’s Parliamentary Board rejected his resignation, the then BJP chief Rajnath Singh said Advani would continue to guide the party, and the patriarch withdrew his resignation letter.
In August, 2014, Advani, still an MP, lost his place in the BJP Parliamentary Board, along with veteran leader Murli Manohar Joshi. In June 2015, Advani said Emergency could not be ruled out “as forces that can crush democracy have become stronger”, making his one-time protege and the then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley say at an event, without naming Advani, that Emergency was no longer possibleAdvertisement
The BJP Margdarshak Mandal, in which Advani had been placed, never met, and he was also not fielded in the Lok Sabha elections of 2019, marking the end of his political career.",politics
"Silent on Naveen Patnaik rule, PM Modi targets Congress in first Odisha rally after 2019","In his first public rally in Odisha in five years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday lashed out at the Congress for “neglecting and insulting Odisha”, but remained silent over the 24-year rule of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) led by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik.
It is another matter that the Odisha BJP leaders have been urging people to usher in change in the state in the upcoming simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly polls. The BJP is the principal Opposition in the state.
PM Modi addressed the rally immediately after he and CM Patnaik shared a stage on a different occasion — the inauguration of the Sambalpur campus of the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), where the PM hailed the BJD supremo as “his friend”. Patnaik also lauded Modi, saying: “The PM has set a new direction for India and we are on the path to becoming an economic power house.”Advertisement

Modi, who later addressed the public meeting organised by the state BJP at Remed in Sambalpur, made his “guarantee” pitch and listed his government’s contribution to Odisha in different fields. He also drew a comparison between the Centre’s contribution to the state before 2014 and in the past 10 years under his rule.
PM Modi had last addressed a public rally in the state at Kendrapada on April 23, 2019, before the fourth phase of polling for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, where he had targeted Patnaik over violence against BJP workers, comparing Odisha with neighbouring Bengal.
He had then charged that “Bengal-type violence” had been used in Odisha against his party’s cadre, and that administrative officers had ignored it. “Naveen Babu, you are going, it’s decided. These handful of officers cannot save you,” he had then said.
Months before, while addressing a rally at Jharsuguda on September 22, 2018, PM Modi had attacked the Patnaik government over alleged corruption. “Without bribes and corruption, it’s not possible to get work done in Odisha,” Modi had then alleged.Advertisement

Even Union Home Minister Amit Shah had dubbed Patnaik as a “burnt transformer” before the 2019 polls, and called the people to oust the BJD government.
It all changed after 2019 polls, when the BJD extended support to the Modi government inside and outside Parliament on numerous issues, including the passage of key legislation and the Presidential election. In return, it earned praise from the PM in Parliament in February 2022 over the mining sector’s “reforms”.
Likewise, Amit Shah, during his visit to Odisha in August last year, hailed Patnaik as a “popular CM” and lauded his steps in disaster management and containing of the “Maoist menace”. A month later, Patnaik gave PM Modi a ranking of 8/10 for his foreign policies and steps taken to fight corruption.
Modi’s Sambalpur speech Saturday was keenly watched by the state BJP leaders, as it was expected to set the tone for the party’s campaign in Odisha for the 2024 polls due in the next two months.Advertisement

Pointing out that Modi’s attack on the BJD government would have boosted the morale of the state BJP cadre ahead of the polls, a senior BJP leader admitted that Patnaik has “close ties” with the party high command. He, however, ruled out speculation about any pre-poll alliance between the two parties.
Underlining the BJP’s contributions in Odisha, Modi said it is the BJP that had made a tribal daughter of the state (Droupadi Murmu) the President of India, and targeted the Congress and its allies for opposing her candidature.
“When she (President Murmu) addressed Parliament three days back, the entire world listened to her every word. My dear brothers and sisters, you should remember that it’s the Congress and its allies that had used all their might against Droupadi Murmu,” said Modi.

He said Odisha had to worry for its dues when there was “Congress ka raj” (Congress rule) in Delhi, and assured that there will be no dearth of money for Odisha’s development under the BJP’s rule.
Claiming that he visits Odisha with a resolution to accelerate the state’s development, he reminded people of visits by Congress leaders before 2014 in an apparent dig at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi — who had visited Kalahandi to support the Dongria Kondh tribe in their fight against the bauxite mining project in Niyamgiri Hills.

“These people used to visit Kalahandi to be photographed in tribal hamlets, which would be shown on TV and in newspapers, projecting a poverty-stricken image of Odisha,” said Modi, accusing the Congress of having made the bids to deprive Odisha of development.
Hitting out at the Congress for “corruption”, Modi alleged that before 2014, corruption was bigger than the Budget. He said India’s youth were disappointed before 2014, as their future was in the dark, while the youth of today are confident because of the “imandaar aur majboot (honest and strong)” BJP government.Advertisement

BJP MLA who shot at Shinde Sena leader in a Thane police station: Who is Ganpat Gaikwad?,"When late on Friday, the BJP’s Kalyan (East) MLA Ganpat Gaikwad opened fire at Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde) leader Mahesh Gaikwad inside the Hill Line police station in Ulhasnagar in Thane district, it marked a new low in Maharashtra politics.
Both leaders belonging to the ruling coalition had approached the police station along with their supporters to lodge complaints over a land dispute. After a heated argument, the BJP MLA pointed a gun at the Shinde Sena leader and fired. Taken aback, Mahesh tried to run but tripped and fell, at which time Ganpat pumped several bullets into him at point blank range. Mahesh, who was seriously injured, had to be rushed to Jupiter Hospital in Thane.
A former corporator, Mahesh is the Shinde Sena’s Ulhasnagar chief. Insiders say Mahesh is always seen surrounded by a dozen followers, a measure of his political clout. They attribute his quick rise in politics to support from the Shinde group, which was said to be considering him as its candidate for the Kalyan (East) Assembly seat in the coming polls, bringing him into conflict with Ganpat.Advertisement
Already, there are whispers of a rift within the ruling coalition. Acknowledging the point, BJP insiders said, “Although a land dispute may have led to the immediate incident, the rivalry between Mahesh and Ganpat is the outcome of an ugly war to control Kalyan (East).”

Three-term MLA Ganpat is considered to be the unchallenged leader in Kalyan (East), one of the six Assembly segments that constitute the Kalyan Lok Sabha seat, which was created in 2009.
That was also the year when Ganpat, who runs a popular cable TV network in the area, stepped into electoral politics. Contesting as an Independent, he beat his Shiv Sena and Congress rivals to win the Kalyan (East) seat, polling 49% of the total votes.
That electoral success, which also made him the first MLA of the newly-created Kalyan (East) Assembly segment, empowered him politically at a time when an undivided Shiv Sena and BJP were alliance partners.Advertisement
In 2014, Gaikwad again contested as an Independent and won the seat. The 2014 Assembly polls saw multi-cornered contest across Maharashtra, as the Congress, NCP, Shiv Sena and BJP fought separately. Against four strong contenders — Shiv Sena’s Gopal Landge, BJP’s Vishal Pawshe, NCP’s Nilesh Shinde and MNS’s Niten Nikam — Gaikwad held his own, although his vote share dropped to 26%.
A Kalyan (East)-based BJP functionary said, “Gaikwad’s association with the BJP has only been since 2019. But BJP offered him the party ticket looking at his winnability.”
Hailing from a humble background, Ganpat studied in a Zilla Parishad school. His family includes wife Sulabha and children Sayali and Pranav. Nowadays, he introduces himself as a farmer, social worker and businessman. But it is his cable TV network that gives him an advantage over rivals.
A local BJP office bearer, requesting anonymity, said, “Ganpat Gaikwad’s cable network is his USP. During elections, he often gives free cable services for up to a year to the people.” Even local political rivals do not antagonise him, knowing the power of communication via his cable network.Advertisement
As an Independent MLA before 2019, he went after both the NCP and the BJP, the two parties that have significant presence in the area.
In 2019, the BJP made Ganpat its candidate, supported by its then ally, the undivided Shiv Sena. He polled 39% of the total votes to defeat the Independent nominee Dhananjay Borade and the NCP’s Prakash Tare.
The relationship between the Eknath Shinde group and the BJP in Kalyan began to sour ever since Shinde took charge as the Chief Minister in June 2022. BJP insiders say the Kalyan Lok Sabha MP Shrikant Shinde, the CM’s son, has become very influential, empowering the local Shinde Sena workers. This has led to frequent clashes between the BJP and Shinde Sena workers over the last one-and-a-half years.
At a Lok Sabha campaign meeting in Kalyan last year, Ganpat was among the BJP leaders who signed a resolution demanding that the Kalyan Lok Sabha candidate be changed. Local BJP leaders and MLAs even ran a campaign against Shrikant Shinde, urging the top BJP leadership to give a party leader the Lok Sabha ticket, threatening to boycott the polls otherwise.Advertisement
After a series of meetings and interventions, the BJP leadership decided to retain the sitting Sena MP, and told state BJP minister Girish Mahajan and Ravindra Chavan to hold discussions with the party’s local unit to assuage their concerns.
Meanwhile, even after Friday’s shooting episode, Ganpat remains unrepentant. Speaking to the media, he said, “Yes, I shot him (Mahesh). I have no regrets. What I did was in self defense. How can I, as a father, watch unmoved as Shiv Sena (Shinde) leaders beat up my son and drag him to the police station?”
He added, “I had repeatedly complained to the top state leadership, including deputy CM and Home Minister Devendra Fadnavis, about the highhandedness of Sena’s Mahesh Gaikwad. But nothing happened.”
The developments have shaken the local BJP, especially as it comes close to 2024 Lok Sabha polls. Fadnavis has already ordered a high-level probe. The police has been asked to have the incident probed by an additional police commissioner.Advertisement
A state BJP general secretary said, “The party will have to distance itself from the incident. Irrespective of the reasons that led to the crime, there can be no justification for an MLA to shoot someone. It is a crime that will not go unpunished. The party will take appropriate action.”
The Opposition is already attacking the BJP. NCP MP Supriya Sule said, “A BJP MLA using a gun to fire at a rival is a serious law and order challenge. Home Minister Devendra Fadnavis should resign.”
Senior Congress leader and Leader of the Opposition in the state Assembly, Vijay Wadettiwar, said, “It is shocking. A BJP MLA fires inside a police station. Where is law and order?” It also exposed the rivalry between the parties of the ruling coalition.
Uddhav Thackeray-led Sena faction’s leader Sanjay Raut said that they had warned of the “consequences” after the BJP joined hands with the Shinde Sena, adding that their “rivalry has now grown to such an extent that they are ready to kill each other”.",politics
D K Suresh’s ‘separate country’ remark an echo of Cong’s pro-Kannada pitch to counter BJP’s Hindutva,"When on February 1, the lone Congress Lok Sabha MP from Karnataka, D K Suresh, struck a discordant note in his reaction to the Union Budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman – a BJP Rajya Sabha MP from Karnataka — he seemed to be articulating the Congress’s line of attack for the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls.
“Today, we are seeing development funds being given to North Indian states. We are seeing a lot of injustice. If we don’t condemn it, in the coming days we might be forced to demand a separate country due to the imposition on us by Hindi regions,” said the younger brother of Karnataka Congress president and Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar, in his reaction to Kannada channels.
“The share of tax distribution is unequal and North Indian states are getting more. There is an imposition of Hindi on us. The Governor has also rejected an ordinance for 60% signages in Kannada,” he said, referring to the state government’s recent attempt to erect signages in the local language across the state capital, which was stalled on technical grounds.

A Proud Indian & a proud Kannadiga!
South India and especially Karnataka have faced the brutality of injustice in funds distribution. Even after being the 2nd largest GST-contributing state, the center has been utterly unjust to #Karnataka 1/5#Budget2024

“From us (Karnataka) more than Rs 4 lakh crore is collected as various taxes. How much are we getting back? If it is not addressed in the 16th Finance Commission, then people of South India have to raise their voices,” Suresh said.
The statements made by the Congress MP are not isolated. And Suresh is the only non-BJP Lok Sabha MP from Karnataka after both the lone JD(S) MP and the lone Independent MP allied with the BJP after the party won the remaining 25 of the state’s 28 Lok Sabha seats in 2019.
Congress strategy
Suresh’s remarks, although poorly articulated, seem to be part of the Karnataka Congress’s strategy to take on the BJP juggernaut in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls — in which Hindutva is likely to be the BJP’s key plank with Prime Minister Narendra Modi being the face of its campaign.

On January 29, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had expressed a similar view on social media, that of the people of Karnataka being under siege in terms of allocation of central finances, and the BJP MPs from the state being mum about it.Advertisement
“The Union BJP government has been doing injustice to Kannadigas. It is not just with respect to the flood relief — they have done injustice even with respect to devolution of funds, funds for infrastructure and more. Despite this, the 25 BJP Lok Sabha members from the state have remained silent,” the CM wrote in Kannada on his X account.
The sentiments expressed by Siddaramaiah and Suresh have been articulated in different ways over the last six months by Congress leaders, which wants to send the unequivocal message that electing BJP MPs is a “futile exercise” as they are “unwilling” to take on their central leaders even for the sake of the state.
“There are 26 BJP MPs and one BJP-supported MP in Karnataka. I fail to understand what they are doing in support of the distressed farmers and people of the state. How will these MPs face the people in the future,” Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala said recently, accusing the Centre of “step-motherly treatment” for Karnataka.

“It is unfortunate that the MPs of @BJP4Karnataka are not questioning this injustice. They have become puppets of Narendra Modi. To whom are they loyal? Kannadigas or Narendra Modi?” the CM stated.Advertisement
Even as his brother’s remarks created a furore this week, Shivakumar announced Friday that the state government would stage a protest in New Delhi on February 7 against the Centre’s “step-motherly treatment” towards the state. “Karnataka has been getting a raw deal in Union Budgets. The state has lost revenue of about Rs 62,000 crore in the last five years,” he said.
Rising Congress pitch
While the Congress has been complaining of “discrimination” by the Centre in fund allocations since the party came to power in the state in May 2023, the party’s stand earlier was directed against alleged injustice by the 15th Finance Commission. Ever since Siddaramaiah met PM Modi in Delhi in December 2023, it has become more about the BJP government at the Centre.
“Karnataka has suffered heavy revenue loss on account of past Finance Commission recommendations, which needs to be challenged before the 16th Finance Commission. Karnataka’s share in tax devolution reduced from 4.713% under the 14th Finance Commission to 3.647% under the 15th Finance Commission,” the CM said at a conference on Fiscal Federalism at the M S Ramaiah University of Applied Sciences in Bengaluru some weeks ago.
At the meeting with the PM in December, Siddaramaiah had sought the release of Rs 18,177.44 crore of relief funds, including Rs 4,663.12 crore towards input subsidy, Rs 12,577.86 crore for emergency relief and another Rs 363.68 crore to save cattle.Advertisement
“The fact that the Congress government is in power in the state seems to concern the BJP-led central government. From devolution of tax to the injustice in drought relief disbursal, to the sale of banks, ports and airports built by Kannadigas, the central government is constantly attacking Kannadigas with political malice,” Siddaramaiah said recently.
“So far, we have written 17 letters requesting drought relief, but we have neither received a response nor any financial assistance. From September last year till today, we have been writing letters asking for the state’s share of drought relief,” he said.

On January 18, the CM referred to an article in Al Jazeera regarding a book by former Niti Ayog official BVR Subramanyam and said it exposed “the Narendra Modi government’s hidden agenda in manipulating the financial autonomy of Indian states”.
In a memo given to the PM in December 2023, Siddaramaiah said that a request for relief of Rs 4,860.13 crore was submitted to the Union Agriculture Ministry on September 22, 2023, followed by the visit of an Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) to the state between October 4 and October 9.Advertisement
“It is nearly three months since we submitted our first memorandum, and two months since the IMCT made its field visit. The farmers of Karnataka are in deep distress. Since crops have failed, it is necessary that we pay them an input subsidy soon, to alleviate their hardship and suffering,” said the CM’s memorandum submitted to the PM.
Despite the lack of funds from the Centre, the state government claims to have released Rs 550 crore as relief to farmers from its own kitty in the first phase.
The Congress government has budgeted Rs 59,000 crore per annum for fulfilling five guarantees — free bus rides for women, Rs 2,000 allowance per month for women in poor households, free power, Rs 3,000 job allowance for unemployed graduates, and free rice.
Linguistic sub-nationalism
In between the attacks on the Centre for not releasing drought relief funds, the Siddaramaiah government has also raised the issue of denial of a tableau to the state at the Republic Day parade in New Delhi, and the “sidelining” of Kannada language in Bengaluru.Advertisement
In December 2023, following protests by pro-Kannada groups against the absence of Kannada in signages in the capital city of Bengaluru, the state government had decided to introduce an ordinance making it mandatory for 60% of signages to be in Kannada. But the ordinance was rejected by Governor Thawarchand Gehlot on technical grounds.
The state BJP has accused Suresh of failing to uphold the sovereignty and unity of the nation as constitutionally mandated. “On the one hand, Rahul Gandhi is doing Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra (and) on the other, Congress MP and KPCC chief D K Shivakumar’s brother, D K Suresh, calls for Bharat Todo. This is exactly the same mindset of the Congress that led to India’s Partition… If an elected MP who has taken an oath to protect the sovereignty and integrity of India calls for dividing India, isn’t it a violation of his oath?” the BJP’s Leader of Opposition in Karnataka R Ashoka said.",politics
"Long arc of Advani journey: Ayodhya Yatra to BJP architect, Vajpayee No. 2 to fade-out","The 96-year-old BJP stalwart and ex-deputy prime minister L K Advani has been awarded India’s highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Saturday.
In a statement on X, PM Modi said, “I am very happy to share that Shri L K Advani ji will be conferred the Bharat Ratna. I also spoke to him and congratulated him on being conferred this honour. One of the most respected statesmen of our times, his contribution to the development of India is monumental.” The PM also, “His is a life that started from working at the grassroots to serving the nation as our deputy Prime Minister. He distinguished himself as our Home Minister and I&B minister as well. His Parliamentary interventions have always been exemplary, full of rich insights.”
The announcement of the Bharat Ratna for Advani comes days after the consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, for which the Ram Janmabhoomi movement was launched by the BJP that was spearheaded by Advani through his Rath Yatra in 1990. The BJP had for the first time backed the Ram Temple movement in 1989 with the Palampur resolution when Advani was the party president.Advertisement

Although Advani could not attend the Ayodhya Temple’s consecration ceremony citing age and the weather, but he wrote an article in Rashtra Dharma to mark the occasion.
In his prime, Advani, whose political career spanned several decades, was a remarkable politician who built his party from a small political outfit to a major national player that could challenge the Congress. He metamorphosed from a BJP organisation man to a mass leader after 1980s, courting controversies and giving his party the thrust to burst onto the national scene, thus converting India into a two-party democracy.
A Partition refugee from Sindh, Advani had joined the RSS as a young man. He later joined the Jana Sangh and worked in close coordination with Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Together, the two built the party brick by brick. If Vajpayee was the flamboyant orator, Advani was the organisation man who always showed he had an eye for spotting talent.
Vajpayee and Advani in tandem toned down the far-right rhetoric of the Jana Sangh in the 1960s to weave alliances with the Opposition parties in a bid to defeat what seemed to be an invincible Congress since 1952. The first alliance with the socialists and Swatantra Party was strung together in the 1963 by-elections for four Lok Sabha seats, with the parties agreeing to field a single candidate on all four. The anti-Congress alliance won three of these seats, with Deen Dayal Upadhyaya being the only losing candidate. Socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia won his Lok Sabha election as a common Opposition candidate.Advertisement
Political Pulse | In Bharat Ratna for Advani, PM Modi pulls another ace
In 1967, the Jana Sangh, socialists, Swatantra and communists formed the Samyukta Vidhayak Dal (SVD) governments in many states, depriving the Congress of power for a brief while in these states. But these governments proved unstable and soon fell.
In 1971, another grand Opposition alliance was stitched up to defeat then PM Indira Gandhi – by this time Chaudhary Charan Singh had broken with the Congress and joined the Opposition alliance – but failed miserably, as Indira was riding a wave on the back of Indira’s ‘garibi hatao (remove poverty)’ slogan.
Despite the loss, Advani’s career had begun to flourish. He became a Rajya Sabha MP for the first time in 1970, turning from a backroom party man to a parliamentarian. He would go on to complete four terms in the Rajya Sabha. His mass phase, however, was still far away.
When Indira imposed the Emergency in the country in 1975, Advani was imprisoned in a Bengaluru jail. Once the Emergency was lifted and fresh elections were announced early in 1977, the Jana Sangh, socialists, Lok Dal and Congress (O), which was formed in 1969 when the Congress split, merged into the Janata Party and defeated the Congress. Advani became the Union minister for Information and Broadcasting and eased many restrictions imposed on the press during the Emergency.Advertisement

Once the Janata Party split on account of its ideological contradictions, the BJP was formed on April 6, 1980, with Advani as a founder member, working under Vajpayee, who was appointed as the party president.
Vajpayee tried to move the party in a direction of moderation – talking about Gandhian socialism and the legacy of Jaya Prakash Narayan – at a time when Indira, now back in power, was quietly taking a right-of-centre turn and taking a hard line on Khalistani militancy. Her assassination in 1984 led to riots and a wave of mass sympathy for her son Rajiv Gandhi, under whose leadership the Congress again stormed to power in the 1984 Lok Sabha polls.
Vajpayee was soon replaced by Advani as BJP president.
As the PM Rajiv Gandhi had a tough time due to the Shah Bano controversy and the Bofors scandal. The BJP and the Janata Dal led by V P Singh, who had made Bofors a major issue, made seat-sharing arrangements in the 1989 Lok Sabha elections. The Congress lost the majority, though still remaining the single-largest party. V P Singh became the Prime Minister with outside support from the BJP and the Left.
The running feud between V P Singh and his deputy PM Devi Lal led to the former gaining the edge by announcing the implementation of the Mandal Commission report to provide 27% reservation in central government jobs to the Other Backward Classes (OBCs).Advertisement
Advani’s rise
In 1989, the BJP under Advani took a decisive ideological line. It gave up Gandhian socialism as the motto Vajpayee had been earlier promoting, and supported the Ram Janmabhoomi movement of the RSS and VHP through the Palampur resolution of 1989, which called for the site to be handed over to Hindus either through a negotiated process or legislation. The party had openly embraced Hindutva. Advani followed this up with a Rath Yatra from Somnath to Ayodhya from September 25, 1990.
The Yatra became a roaring success, polarising society along religious lines. There were riots in many places. Advani, who was arrested by Lalu Prasad’s government when his Yatra reached Samastipur in Bihar, became an instant mass leader, overshadowing Vajpayee.
This made Advani a key Lok Sabha face for almost the next two decades. He won from Delhi and Gujarat, the latter offering him multiple victories. After winning his first Lok Sabha election in 1989, he went on to become a seven-term Lok Sabha MP.
However, with the party becoming ‘untouchable’ in the wake of the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya in 1992, it required the moderate face of Vajpayee once again. Using his gift of speech to perfection, Vajpayee defended the BJP several times in Parliament.Advertisement
Advani surprised many by announcing that Vajpayee would be the face of the BJP for the 1996 Lok Sabha elections. The BJP continued to rise, forming governments for 13 days, 13 months and then six years, all under Vajpayee, between 1996 and 2004, with a 1996-98 hiatus in between. Advani now became the No. 2, playing the role of Deputy PM and Union Home minister.
Advani’s decline
After Vajpayee lost power in the 2004 Lok Sabha polls and his health began to deteriorate, Advani tried to step into his shoes. In 2005, he created controversy by calling Muhammad Ali Jinnah “secular” during a visit to Pakistan. The RSS was not happy and Advani had to resign as the BJP president.
However, what Advani was trying from now on was to cultivate an image of moderation so as to be acceptable to allies for the 2009 Lok Sabha elections. But he was stumbling while trying his image makeover. In 2009, the BJP lost badly with Advani as its PM candidate, winning just 116 seats. The Congress won 206 seats, its highest tally since 1991.
Advani tried to remain at the centre stage as the BJP appointed Nitin Gadkari and then Rajnath Singh as party president. But then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi was rising, even as Advani’s stock was rapidly falling. Advani was introduced as ‘Param Shraddheya (most venerable)’ in public meetings, and he would reminisce about his long political journey, repeatedly saying ‘mujhe smaran hai (I remember)’ and clutching both his hands in his trademark style, but he was slowly but surely approaching his political sunset. He had already lost the Leader of Opposition position to his protege Sushma Swaraj. He was soon to lose the chance to be the party’s face for the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, as Modi was first made the campaign committee coordinator and, soon afterwards, declared the party’s PM face for the elections.Advertisement
With the Congress facing massive anti-incumbency over corruption charges, Modi stormed to power in 2014. Advani, still a Lok Sabha MP, was to soon lose his place in the BJP’s Parliamentary Board, the party’s highest decision-making body, and was accommodated in a new body called the Margdarshak Mandal. In 2019, he did not get a Lok Sabha ticket from the party. His political dusk had finally arrived.
Advani, a man who showed immense physical energy even up to a ripe old age and led a disciplined life, gradually disappeared from the public view. He stopped taking requests for appointments from journalists.
With the conferring of the Bharat Ratna on Advani, the Modi government has feted the man who changed the course of India’s political journey.",politics
"In Bharat Ratna for Advani, PM Modi pulls another acePremium Story","Veteran BJP leader and former deputy prime Minister LK Advani has been awarded India’s highest civilian honour Bharat Ratna, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Saturday.
The development comes days after the Modi government announced the Bharat Ratna for former Bihar CM and OBC reservation pioneer Karpoori Thakur.
The announcement of the Bharat Ratna for Advani is significant given the complicated relationship that PM Modi has shared with the 96-year-old BJP leader. It is widely believed that it was Advani who promoted Modi as a young RSS worker and elevated him in the BJP ranks, helping him eventually to become Gujarat CM in early 2000s. It is also said that it was Advani who saved Modi’s CM chair after the 2002 Gujarat riots when the then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee had appeared to be disappointed over it.Advertisement
However, after 2012, as Modi began positioning himself to emerge as the party’s principal face at the national level, Advani showed discomfort which did not please the former. After his ascent to power, Advani was named as a member of the BJP’s Margdarshak Mandal, which was dubbed as a “retirement bench” of the veteran BJP leaders.

I am very happy to share that Shri LK Advani Ji will be conferred the Bharat Ratna. I also spoke to him and congratulated him on being conferred this honour. One of the most respected statesmen of our times, his contribution to the development of India is monumental. His is a… pic.twitter.com/Ya78qjJbPK
— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) February 3, 2024
The announcement of the Bharat Ratna for Advani is also significant as it comes close on the heels of the consecration of Ram Temple in Ayodhya, given that Advani is widely considered as a key architect of the Ayodhya movement that catapulted the BJP to the centre-stage of national politics. The country’s highest civilian honour for Advani at this time is likely to add to the BJP’s Temple narrative ahead of the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.
While the Padma and Bharat Ratna awards have always been a way of political messaging, apart from recognition of a person’s contribution, the Modi government has been particularly astute in its choices. Including in the case of the Bharat Ratna for Karpoori Thakur at a time when the Opposition has been hoping to build its demand for a caste census into a plank formidable enough to take on the BJP’s post-Ram Temple Hindutva fervour.
The other five conferred Bharat Ratna since Modi came to power include educationist, freedom fighter and once-Congress president Madan Mohan Malviya; ex-PM and BJP leader Vajpayee; former President and Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee; Assamese singer and musician Bhupen Hazarika; and RSS leader Nanaji Deshmukh.
The honour for Malviya and Vajpayee came in 2015, within a year of the Modi government’s formation.Advertisement
While Malviya was part of the Congress and served as its president for four terms, he has always been considered by the Sangh Parivar as closer to its ideology. In the freedom struggle, Malaviya was midway between the Liberals and the Nationalists, the Moderates and the Extremists, as the followers of Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Bal Gangadhar Tilak in the Congress were respectively considered.
Malviya was also the founder of the Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha (1906) and Banaras Hindu University, serving as the university’s vice-chancellor from 1919 until 1938. The Bharat Ratna was an endorsement of the Sangh’s view that Malviya did not get his due under the Congress, and that it took a BJP government to correct that.
Vajpayee, of course, was the BJP stalwart with friends across parties and with a parliamentary career lasting over four decades, including nine terms in the Lok Sabha and two in the Rajya Sabha. He served as the PM for three terms – two short-lived ones in 1996 and 1998, before becoming the first non-Congress PM to complete five years in power from 1999 to 2004.
Back in the Janata Party government of 1977-79, he had served as the Minister of External Affairs, and in 1994, under the P V Narasimha Rao-led Congress government, he was awarded the “Best Parliamentarian” award.Advertisement
Modi’s acknowledgment of Vajpayee’s achievements was a strong signal to his party’s own ranks, with the two leaders seen as representing two ends of the BJP spectrum. One of the lowest points of Modi’s political career was Vajpayee as PM frowning upon his government’s role during the 2002 Gujarat riots.
In 2019, the Modi government picked Pranab Mukherjee, one of the Congress’s oldest veterans, for Bharat Ratna. The award came to Mukherjee just a year after he had accepted an invite to deliver an annual lecture at the RSS headquarters in Nagpur.
The honour was seen as the BJP underlining its charge against the Gandhis-led Congress of “sidelining” Mukherjee, despite his central role in the party for years, for the sake of “dynasty politics”.
In a political career spanning five decades, Mukherjee occupied some of the top positions under Congress governments, including Finance and Home. In 2012, towards the fag end of UPA-II, Mukherjee was appointed as the President of India, which was seen as a way of “retiring” him as Rahul Gandhi came to the fore in the party.Advertisement
Along with Mukherjee, the Modi government recommended the Bharat Ratna for Bhupen Hazarika in 2019. One of the foremost cultural icons of the Northeast, Hazarika wore many hats as singer, lyricist, musician, filmmaker and cultural activist, and the award fulfilled a long-standing demand from his fans and the region.
It also fit in nicely with the BJP’s push – ultimately successful – for the Northeast, and Hazarika’s native state Assam.
Another recipient of the Bharat Ratna that year was Chandikadas Amritrao Deshmukh, better known as Nanaji Deshmukh. Deshmukh had worked in the fields of education, health and rural self-reliance, but his greatest contribution was seen as building the Jana Sangh, the precursor to the BJP, as a formidable force.
Deshmukh’s efforts helped the Jana Sangh build support, politically and financially, among the Bombay business community. As treasurer of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, he was instrumental in expanding it from its image of a party of small north Indian traders, to one backed by big business in both Bombay and Guajarat.Advertisement
Many argue that PM Modi has followed the footsteps of Deshmukh in shaping the BJP.
Pre-Modi era
Under the Congress governments, the Bharat Ratna choices have been more conventional – including to sitting Prime Ministers Jawaharlal Nehru in 1955, and Indira Gandhi in 1971 (after the Bangladesh War victory). In 1966, Lal Bahadur Shastri became the third PM to get a Bharat Ratna, after his sudden death.
In 1988, under the Rajiv Gandhi government, ahead of the Tamil Nadu Assembly elections, the state’s iconic film star-turned-politician and former CM M G Ramachandran was awarded the Bharat Ratna.
In 1990, the Janata Dal government headed by V P Singh, and supported by the BJP, picked B R Ambedkar for the honour; the same year, it also awarded Nelson Mandela. In 1991, under the Narasimha Rao-led Congress government, it was the turn of Morarji Desai, Vallabhbhai Patel and the recently assassinated Rajiv Gandhi to get Bharat Ratna.Advertisement
In 1992, the Congress government honoured Abul Kalam Azad, the freedom fighter and former education minister, and Ratan Tata.
Under the short-lived coalition governments after 1996, twice acting PM Gulzarilal Nanda, freedom fighter Aruna Asaf Ali and A P J Abdul Kalam (who would later become President) were among those who got the honour.
The Vajpayee-led government from 1999 to 2004 saw the Bharat Ratna go to socialist icon and Janata Party hero Jayaprakash Narayan and Professor Amartya Sen, apart from several classical musicians.
Under the Manmohan Singh government from 2004 to 2014, only three Bharat Ratnas were conferred: to classical vocalist Bhimsen Joshi, cricketer Sachin Tendulkar and Prof C N R Rao.",politics
"Ticket allocation a mess 5 years ago, why Congress has placed faith in a new system in Odisha","Struggling to remain relevant and regain its “lost glory” in Odisha, where it was in power for more than four decades till 2000, the Congress says it has introduced a transparent and unbiased ticket distribution system for the coming Lok Sabha and Assembly polls that will be held simultaneously.
The new system, named “Project Nyay”, will be headed by former Madhya Pradesh MLA Praveen Pathak who represented Gwalior South from 2018 to 2023 but lost in the Assembly polls last December. “The process of ticket distribution will remain the same but the new system is aimed to maintain transparency in the distribution system and to find out the best people on the ground through meticulous surveys with bigger sample sizes,” Congress’s Odisha in-charge Ajoy Kumar told The Indian Express.
The party is also set to launch an online website and issue electronic forms through which anyone, including youth interested in joining politics, can apply for a party ticket. “A team from Delhi has already arrived to carry out surveys in different constituencies to gauge the popularity of those who will apply for tickets and to collect data on other aspects. The data, which will be collected from the ground, will be placed unedited before the Pradesh Election Committee and subsequently before the Central Election Committee and the screening committee for consideration,” Kumar said.Advertisement
Political Pulse | Congress crisis deepens in Odisha ahead of 2024 polls as two senior leaders suspended
This comes a week after Odisha Congress appealed to ticket aspirants “not to pay bribes to anyone” for the assurance of getting tickets.
Stating that anybody who is sincere and working on the ground will be supported, Kumar said no amount of pressure from any leaders to consider the candidature of their children or relatives would work.
“It does not mean that we will not give tickets to the son or daughter of any leader. If they have the potential to win and are working on the ground, we will definitely consider their names. But any kind of lobbying or pressure tactics won’t work,” he added.
Kumar said the idea was introduced on a trial basis in a constituency in Madhya Pradesh. Though he refused to disclose the name of the constituency, he claimed the experiment was a success.
The Congress play
The Congress, whose electoral footprint has consistently shrunk over the past two decades, wants to get rid of leaders who lost successive polls and those from constituencies where its vote share has been steadily diminishing, according to party insiders. It wants to infuse fresh blood into the organisation by bringing in more young faces and women with wider appeal. Those who lost the last 2019 elections by a thin margin will be given a chance to contest the polls.Advertisement
 CHART: Congress seats/vote shares in Assembly polls
In 2019, the party suffered a severe blow even before the elections with as many as half a dozen candidates pulling out of the contest after the party officially announced their names. Among the prominent leaders who withdrew are former Pipili MLA Yudhistir Samantray, former Barchana MLA Sitakant Mohapatra, Prithvi Ballabh Patnaik who is the son of three-time CM J B Patnaik but has never been elected, and Muktikanta Biswal who drew national attention following his 1,500-km walk from Rourkela to New Delhi to demand from Prime Minister Narendra Modi better infrastructure in the steel city.

While Mohapatra and Samantray blamed the late announcement of their candidature, Patnaik cited personal reasons for declining to contest from Begunia, the seat once represented by his late father. Biswal who was fielded from Rourkela returned the ticket saying there were many other deserving candidates.
Infighting over ticket distribution also hurt the party before the polls, with many senior leaders accusing then Pradesh Congress Committee president Niranjan Patnaik of promoting dynastic politics and denying tickets to deserving candidates. The party also admitted that the irregular, delayed, and unilateral ticket distribution system was a major factor behind the drubbing it received in the election when the party was pushed to third place in Odisha.
“If senior leaders publicly refuse to contest even after being officially declared as candidates, don’t you think it will hamper the party’s prospects? We don’t want that mess at least in those constituencies where the party has considerable strength. We want to do it (ticket distribution) in a systematic manner this time,” said a senior Congress leader.Advertisement
Odisha Congress president Sarat Pattanayak told reporters on Thursday, “AICC screening committee chairman Madhusudan Mistry and his two associates have already held discussions with various leaders to discuss what went wrong last time and tried to ascertain the reason behind the Congress’s fall in Odisha.”

Strongholds and strategies
Sources in the Congress said the party wants to concentrate and mobilise its resources in the southern and western districts of the state, especially the Koraput-Balangir-Kalahandi regions comprising eight districts in which the party has a significant support base. In coastal areas, the party is concentrating on select constituencies where it has had a sizeable vote share in recent polls.
“Out of around 90 Assembly seats that saw close fights in 2019, the Congress finished second in as many as 26 seats across regions where the party’s vote share was between 30% to 40%. With better candidate selection and strategy, we can ensure the Congress’s victory in those seats,” said a party leader.Advertisement
With an eye on consolidating Opposition votes in its favour, the party has been trying to “expose” what it alleges is a nexus between the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) and the BJP. The party is also seeking strategic alliances with smaller parties such as the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) in Mayurbhanj and Sundargarh, where the Hemant Soren-led party has a sound base, and the Left in some pockets.",politics

1. You require daily contact with someone you just met
2. You don’t express needs and say “it’s all good”
3. You get physically intimate quickly
4. You expect exclusivity from the start
5. You don’t ask questions that could reveal “red flags”

If you identify as having an anxious attachment style, here’s what you can do to foster healthier, happier connections:
Dr Shailesh Jha, consultant psychiatrist, Indraprastha Apollo Saarthak Mental Health Services, New Delhi listed the following:
*Identify the root cause: Reflect on childhood experiences that may have contributed to feelings of abandonment and rejection. Consider seeking therapy or counseling to explore these issues further.Advertisement
*Practice mindfulness: Engage in mindfulness exercises regularly to stay present and reduce worries about the future of relationships. This could include meditation, deep breathing exercises, or grounding techniques.
*Reframe worrisome ideas: When negative thoughts arise, challenge them by considering evidence to the contrary and adopting a more realistic perspective on your partner’s availability and reliability.
*Accept discomfort and dispute: Instead of avoiding conflict or making assumptions, communicate openly with your partner about your concerns. Practice active listening and strive for understanding rather than escalation.
*Communicate effectively: Express your concerns honestly but respectfully to your partner without emotionally dumping on them. Ask for their preferred methods of seeking comfort or support.Advertisement
*Develop self-confidence and self-soothing skills: Work on building your own sense of security and reassurance independent of your partner. Engage in activities that promote self-care and self-esteem.
*Set boundaries and prioritise needs: Establish clear boundaries within your relationship and assert your own needs. Balance your commitments and obligations to maintain a healthy equilibrium.

Gen Z boys’ attitudes to feminism are more nuanced than negative,"Young men are more likely than older men to think that has done more harm than good, according to a new survey, suggesting a backward step in attitudes to gender equality. Young women aged 16-29 are also slightly more likely than women aged 30-59 to say that feminism has done more harm than good.
The survey, conducted by King’s College London and Ipsos, also found a growing divergence in attitudes towards feminism, masculinity and gender equality between young men and young women.
On the surface, the findings chime with our experiences of conducting research directly with young people on these topics and delivering relationships and sex education in schools. But in both our work and the survey data, the reality is more nuanced than these headline findings suggest.Advertisement
Most of the survey sample — including the younger age groups — do not sit at the more divided extremes of the response options. While 16% of men aged 16-29 thought feminism had done more harm than good, more than double this proportion, 36%, thought it had done more good than harm.
Who’s a feminist?
In our recent experience of working in schools delivering and evaluating an educational session designed to address harmful sexual behaviour in schools, we asked the young people how many would identify themselves as a feminist. In response, there were often just two or three hands raised, often accompanied by an odd snide comment from one of the boys.
Both boys and girls seem disinclined to endorse feminism, with this perhaps counter-intuitive tendency among young women having been seen for some time.
But when we probe a little deeper and ask if they believe in equality between genders or what they understand by feminism, a different picture emerges.Advertisement
The young people we work with often have a firm understanding of the inequality that exists between men and women. They typically endorse the idea that people should not be restricted or disadvantaged by their gender, but that possible disadvantage as a result of gender is nuanced and flows in both directions: both boys and girls are affected by gender stereotypes and pressures.
The girls in the room are quick to point out the double standards which, they feel, means they are judged more harshly and experience more social shaming connected to their bodies and sexual behaviour than boys. They talk about the effect of gender inequality on their ability to make free choices and to feel safe in their day-to-day lives. Unwanted attention, sexual harassment and feeling unsafe are still a rite of passage for teenage girls.
The boys, meanwhile, with the demands of masculinity thrust upon them, rarely consider themselves powerful or privileged. They are often insecure in their bodies, embarrassed and out of their depth – especially in their intimate and sexual relationships where they are expected to take control.
We have found that young people have a straightforward desire for authentic and healthy relationships be that with their same- or opposite-sex peers. They find it difficult to translate these aspirations into reality, however, as they navigate existing social and cultural expectations and pressures surrounding gender and relationships.Advertisement
Boys and young men, in particular, are pulled between ideas of traditional masculinity and demands to be emotionally self-aware and sensitive.
The role of adults
 The survey, conducted by King’s College London and Ipsos, also found a growing divergence in attitudes towards feminism, masculinity and gender equality between young men and young women. (Source: Freepik)
When thinking about young people’s attitudes to feminism, we need to acknowledge that it is older generations who write the social scripts for boys and girls. It is older generations who frame sex, still, as something boys do to girls – as one of us found when interviewing teachers about how they educate boys about consent.
And it is older adults – such as the 37-year-old social media influencer Andrew Tate – who preach that feminism has gone too far. Media coverage of the King’s College and Ipsos Mori survey has emphasised the finding that one in five young men we surveyed approved of him. But this means that only a minority of boys and young men who said they had heard of Tate had a positive view of him.
More than half of the young men said they found Tate’s views offensive. This finding reflects what we are encountering in our research work: a dwindling interest in Tate among young people.Advertisement
In our experience, most young people are open-minded, inclusive and tolerant. They are critical thinkers when allowed to think for themselves rather than being fed easy answers by the adults around them or, as seemed to be the case in this survey, asked to select between options framed as competing interests between men and women.
Our research underscores the need for a youth-centric approach to tackling issues relating to gender and relationships with young people that does not tell them what to think, but more how to think in ways that respond to their concerns. The adults in young people’s lives – parents, teachers and others – should think about, and talk to them about, why influencers like Tate gain traction.

Navigate your 40s with these essential nutrients,"Reaching your 40s signifies a new chapter in life, often accompanied by subtle changes in your body’s needs. As your metabolism shifts and hormonal fluctuations occur, ensuring you receive the right nutrients becomes even more crucial.
Dr Sri Karan Uddesh Tanugula, consultant general physician, Yashoda Hospitals Hyderabad, shed light on essential nutrients for people in their 40s and how to address potential deficiencies.
Understanding Common Deficiencies
Men in their 40s may experience a decline in testosterone levels, leading to decreased muscle mass, lower libido, and potential mood changes, according to Dr Tanugula. Additionally, they might face increased risks for heart health concerns like high blood pressure and cholesterol.Advertisement

Women, on the other hand, often encounter hormonal changes associated with perimenopause, resulting in symptoms like hot flashes, mood swings, and irregular periods, said Dr Tanugula. They may also experience bone density loss, increasing the risk of osteoporosis, and fluctuations in estrogen levels, impacting heart health.
Combating Deficiencies Through a Multifaceted Approach
Addressing these deficiencies requires a multi-pronged approach, explained Dr Tanugula.
Balanced Diet: Prioritise a diverse and nutrient-rich diet. Consume plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats to ensure you’re getting essential vitamins, minerals, and other vital nutrients.
Supplementation: Depending on individual needs and health conditions, consider supplementing your diet with specific vitamins like D, B12, and minerals like calcium and magnesium. Men facing testosterone deficiencies may benefit from consulting a healthcare professional about hormone replacement therapy.Advertisement
Lifestyle Optimisation: Regular exercise, effective stress management, adequate sleep, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption significantly contribute to overall health and can help address specific deficiencies.

Essential Nutrients for Optimal Health in Your 40s
Calcium and Vitamin D: This powerful duo is crucial for maintaining strong bones, especially important for women to prevent osteoporosis.
B Vitamins: B12, B6, and folate play vital roles in energy metabolism, brain health, and DNA synthesis.
Omega-3 Fatty Acids: These essential fats support heart health, and cognitive function, and may help reduce inflammation.Advertisement
Protein: As muscle mass naturally declines with age, consuming adequate protein is essential for muscle maintenance and repair.

5 superfoods to help you lose weight quickly,"Losing weight can feel like an uphill battle, but incorporating superfoods into your diet can provide a much-needed boost. These nutrient-dense powerhouses offer more than just flavour; they can support your weight loss goals in various ways. Let’s explore how, with insights from Ekta Singhwal, a dietician at Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals.
Superfood Powerhouse: Aiding Weight Loss Naturally
Superfoods come packed with essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that play a crucial role in weight management. They work in several ways:
Boost Metabolism: Certain superfoods contain compounds that can stimulate your metabolic rate, helping your body burn more calories at rest.Advertisement
Promote Satiety: Feeling full and satisfied after meals is key to avoiding unhealthy snacking and overeating. Superfoods rich in fiber and healthy fats can keep you feeling fuller for longer, reducing cravings and calorie intake.

Regulate Blood Sugar: Spikes in blood sugar levels can lead to increased hunger and cravings. Superfoods with a low glycemic index help regulate blood sugar, preventing these unhealthy surges.
Top 5 Superfoods for Weight Loss
Now, let’s delve into some specific superfoods and their weight-loss benefits, according to Dr Singhwal.

Avocado: This creamy fruit is a treasure trove of healthy fats and fibre. These nutrients promote satiety and reduce cravings, helping you manage your calorie intake effectively.
Quinoa: This versatile grain is a complete protein source, meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids. Additionally, quinoa is high in fiber, keeping you feeling full for longer and preventing overeating.
Chia Seeds: These tiny powerhouses are packed with fiber and omega-3 fatty acids. When consumed, chia seeds absorb water and expand in your stomach, curbing your appetite and promoting a feeling of fullness.
Salmon: This fatty fish is an excellent source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids. These nutrients play a role in regulating appetite and reducing inflammation, which can contribute to weight gain.
Green Tea: This popular beverage contains catechins and caffeine, both of which can boost your metabolism and increase fat burning during exercise, aiding in your weight loss efforts.

Superfoods are a valuable addition to a healthy weight loss plan, but they are not a magic bullet. They work best when combined with a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and a healthy lifestyle.Advertisement

"Trainer hails Sonu Nigam’s commitment to building strength, endurance; know how to improve yours","Fitness is not just a fad, it is a lifestyle. Showing us the way forward are commoners and celebrities alike. One such is singer Sonu Nigam whose dedication and consistency earned praise recently from his trainer Prateek Kumar who has been training him for a year now. In a note shared on Instagram, Kumar mentioned that Nigam is of “one of the most obedient students I’ve come across”. “Let’s take a moment to appreciate the sheer dedication and hard work of @sonunigamofficial sir! It’s been nearly a year since we started working on his fitness journey together, and his commitment to his wellness and fitness is nothing short of inspiring,” he expressed.
Despite his demanding schedule of performing on stage for concerts practically every other day, Kumar shared that Nigam remains unwaveringly disciplined. “He’s not just hitting the gym consistently, but he’s also meticulous about his cardio, nutrition, and supplementation no matter where he travels,” said Kumar.
Kumar mentioned that it’s clients like Nigam “who make my job an absolute joy”! “His dedication is reflected in his continuous progress – from strength gains to pushing his endurance limits and maintaining high energy levels,” said Kumar.Advertisement
But what truly sets him apart is his humility and dedication to his craft, a side of him that not everyone gets to see, he added.
Taking a cue from Nigam, we decided to ask our in-house expert how to improve our endurance levels.
To enhance your endurance levels, a multifaceted approach involving both physical and mental aspects is essential. “Incorporating a structured training regimen, proper nutrition, adequate rest, and mental resilience strategies can significantly contribute to improving endurance,” said fitness expert Garima Goyal.
What to keep in mind?
Establish a structured training regimen – Begin by designing a well-rounded training program that encompasses cardiovascular exercises, strength training, and flexibility workouts. “Gradually increase the intensity and duration of your sessions, incorporating high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to boost cardiovascular endurance. Consistency is paramount for long-term progress,” said Goyal.Advertisement
Nutrition – Maintain a balanced diet rich in complex carbohydrates, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Goyal said that carbohydrates serve as a primary energy source for endurance activities, and ensuring sufficient glycogen stores is essential. “Experiment with fueling strategies during extended workouts and stay adequately hydrated to optimise performance,” said Goyal.
Strategic rest and recovery – Avoid overtraining by incorporating rest days into your training schedule. “Prioritise quality sleep, as it plays a crucial role in muscle repair and overall recovery. Proper rest helps prevent burnout, reduces the risk of injuries, and ensures that your body can adapt positively to the training stimulus,” said Goyal.

Develop mental resilience – Cultivate a positive mindset and mental toughness to overcome challenges during workouts. “Visualisation techniques can mentally prepare you for longer, more demanding exercises. Practice mindfulness or meditation to stay focused and maintain composure during endurance activities, enhancing your overall mental resilience,” said Goyal.
Embrace cross-training – Introduce variety into your workout routine by engaging in different activities like swimming, cycling, or cross-country skiing. Goyal mentioned that cross-training targets various muscle groups reduces monotony, and helps prevent overuse injuries associated with repetitive motions.Advertisement
Invest in proper gear – Ensure you have the right equipment, including supportive footwear and comfortable clothing. Ill-fitting gear can lead to discomfort and increase the risk of injuries. Prioritise equipment that enhances your performance and minimises the risk of physical strain.
Monitor performance metrics – Regularly track your progress by monitoring performance metrics such as distance, pace, and heart rate. According to Goyal, analysing this data allows you to make informed adjustments to your training plan, identifying areas for improvement and celebrating milestones achieved along the way.

Patience and consistency – Acknowledge that progress takes time, and be patient with your journey. Stay consistent with your training, adjusting intensity gradually to avoid burnout. Listen to your body, recognising signs of fatigue or overtraining, and be adaptable in refining your approach based on individual responses to the endurance-building process.

Progressive cardiovascular training – Within your structured training program, progressively challenge your cardiovascular system. Gradually increase the duration and intensity of aerobic exercises like running, cycling, or rowing. “Include interval training to push your limits and improve your body’s ability to sustain effort over extended periods,” said Goyal.",lifestyle
Micromanagement at the workplace? Here are steps that can help,"Looping in the boss on pertinent emails, consultations, and discussions is important in most organisations. But what happens when you are expected to update the boss about every single task? For instance, this is what a customer onboarding professional has been experiencing in her current job: “It is mandatory to update the boss for time management for every task assigned. For example, why did a task that could be done in 10 minutes take 11? Looping in a manager in all emails while communicating with colleagues and clients is another way it is practiced in my workplace. It hampers my work considering it gives the impression that my boss doesn’t trust my capabilities,” the Delhi-based woman expressed.
What is micromanagement?
Divya Jha, senior director of human resources, Johnson Controls India, described micromanagement as a pervasive management style that can be simply characterised by excessive control and close supervision of the subordinates’ work.
Micromanagement manifests in various forms, but is typically rooted in a manager’s lack of trust toward team members, noted Mili Panicker, director- HR and people operations at WebEngage, Mumbai. “It inadvertently turns into a vicious cycle, leading to excessive control and a lack of trust in employees, ultimately harming individual well-being and overall team productivity,” said Panicker.Advertisement
However, Shalini Dasgupta, assistant manager of business development for a Bengaluru-based start-up, expressed that as a common practice in scaling start-ups, micromanaging occurs as you are always in a prolonged habit of wearing multiple hats. “It is the micro-level detailing in every department, usually stemming from the constant fear of balancing out perfection or because of deeper personal insecurities. It is a little detrimental in the long run although it might lead to great results in the short term,” said Dasgupta.
Why does it happen?
Micromanagement is perhaps warranted only in some situations, such as when an employee is new, when the team is dealing with a crisis, or if an employee’s performance needs significant improvement. “It is important to understand that there could be specific reasons why a manager engages in it. For instance, first-time managers may micromanage their employees to avoid any possible failures or mistakes. Some managers may lack the skill to coach or help someone do their job well. Certain managers may also adopt the same managerial style as their superiors,” said Piyali Maity, clinical director, counselling operations, 1to1help, Hyderabad, Telangana.
How does micromanagement affect employees?
While managers may micromanage with good intentions to maintain control and ensure work quality, it negatively impacts morale, productivity, and mental health, underlined Ruchi Shah, chief human resources officer (CHRO), WeAce, Mumbai. “Managers may micromanage due to a lack of trust in the team, insecurity, fear of failure, anxiety, poor delegation skills, or lack of experience,” shared Shah.

In today’s evolving workplace expectations, this has increasingly been deemed counterproductive. A 2023 study by Monster found that 73 per cent of professionals consider micromanagement the leading sign of a toxic workplace or a red flag, underscoring the negative impact of micromanagement on employee well-being and organisational innovation. “Employees feel overwhelmed, stressed, and unable to use their skills under excessive oversight,” said Shah.
Micromanagement in HR officesAdvertisement
“So, our HR portal has this system of punch in and punch out like all offices but say for example if you forget to punch in and seek attendance putting a time before your actual time, they look at the CCTV to verify your time and refuse to grant your attendance otherwise,” said a Gurugram-based advertising professional.
In response, a human capital analyst at Deloitte, Bengaluru asserted that micromanagement can occur in HR just like any other department or field. “This excessive focus or extreme monitoring of employees or tasks can be a characteristic of a department, company, or just an individual superior’s style of working,” said the HR professional.
According to this professional, one cannot generalise a field or department and provide an absolute opinion on whether HRs as a group practice micromanagement. “The fact is, HR is a people-centric role. The primary focus of HR professionals is managing and developing the organisation’s workforce. These tasks include recruitment, training, performance management, employee relations, and ensuring compliance with rules and regulations. It also plays a very crucial role in fostering a positive work culture, promoting employee engagement, and facilitating communication between management and staff,” said the professional.
Another point of view is regarding the shift to remote or hybrid working in a post-Covid environment. “It is very evident that if a company has an HR tracking mechanism, it only calls out those employees who in fact may abuse the work-from-home scenario,” said the professional.Advertisement
In Jha’s view, the detrimental effects of micromanagement manifest on two levels: mental health and well-being, and the spirit of innovation and task efficiency. “The feeling of mistrust can lead to a feeling of being undervalued and lack of autonomy, which can have a cascading effect on their confidence and anxiety levels. The fear of admonition, and having every mistake highlighted can instill a deep-seated fear, hindering their learning curve, and growth within their roles,” explained Jha.

The constant scrutiny can lead micromanaged employees to experience burnout, anxiety and low self-esteem. According to Maity, this management style can lead to a loss of autonomy in the employee: they may feel like they have lost their sense of control over work. “An employee’s physical and emotional health can be impacted: they may feel stressed, anxious, and even experience burnout. All these factors eventually lead to a decline in employee productivity and performance, even causing some employees to quit,” said Maity.
What can help?
Employers need to recognise that employees want autonomy, learning, support and connectedness to thrive at work. It is equally important for employers to sensitise managers, particularly first-time managers, with tools and training to manage their teams effectively without being overbearing and hurting team productivity and happiness, urged Maity.
To tackle micromanagement, open communication is key, emphasised Apurva Singh Verma, head of products and service excellence, Elephant In The Room (EITHR). “Encouraging dialogues between managers and employees can promote mutual understanding and trust. Setting clear expectations and boundaries can also mitigate micromanagement tendencies,” said Mumbai-based Singh Verma.Advertisement

Panicker from WebEngage, which offers a hybrid work model that allows employees to work from home for three days a week and from the office for two days, said providing employees with a flexible workplace emphasises the importance of trust among team members. “Continuous feedback between the team member and manager helps them to get to know each other better so managers can provide more personalised feedback to their direct reports, thus increasing the efficacy of their feedback,” said Panicker.

Additionally, training supervisors on empowering leadership styles can prove to be beneficial. Seeking external help, such as consulting with psychologists can also offer valuable insights and strategies for overcoming micromanagement. “Addressing this concern at the workplace requires a concerted effort that would encourage a culture of trust and open doors of communication, promoting the mental health of employees,” added Singh Verma.

Does leaving gluten help prevent gas and bloating? Experts weigh in,"In recent years, going gluten-free has gained considerable traction, with advocates touting it as a solution for various digestive problems. In fact, dietitian Garima Goyal took to Instagram to share that if you are facing gas or bloating, then you need to only make one change to your diet. “Stop gluten,” she said.
Highlighting that it is found in foods like wheat roti, maida, suji, and upma, Goyal urged individuals to stop consuming these and see if they are feeling any difference. “The best way to do this is by following your normal diet for 3 days and check your resting heart rate in bed. Note it down, and then after 3 days start having a gluten-free diet. After starting a gluten-free diet, you have to check 2 things: your resting heart rate and check whether these problems are resolving or not,” she added.
Goyal recommends doing this for 20 days to check if you feel any difference in your body. “If you still doubt whether you should stop gluten, you can take a food intolerance test or a gene test,” she advises.

To verify these claims, we reached out to experts to find out whether gluten has any impact on digestive health.
According to Nivya Vikal, consultant dietitian-nutritionist at Motherhood Hospitals in Noida, removing gluten from the diet may help people with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, as it can cause digestive symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, and constipation. However, she pointed out that there is no evidence that a gluten-free diet will improve health or prevent disease for individuals who don’t have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.Advertisement
“The benefits of going gluten-free are mainly for people with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, as it can help ease digestive symptoms, reduce inflammation, and boost energy levels,” she explained, adding that some people with certain autoimmune disorders, such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or gastrointestinal conditions, may find symptom relief by following a gluten-free diet.
For people without gluten-related conditions, Dr Priyanka Rohatgi, chief nutritionist at Apollo Hospitals, said the benefits of going gluten-free are less clear. “Proponents claim it can increase energy, improve gastrointestinal health, support weight loss, and reduce inflammation. However, there are not many rigorous studies to support these notions for the general population.”
One benefit, though, according to Dr Rohatgi, is that going gluten-free may cause people to eat more whole, unprocessed foods, which can increase nutrient intake.
What are the alternatives to gluten?
Those looking to eliminate gluten from their diet can find various nutritious alternatives. Vikal listed these below:Advertisement

Grains: Quinoa, rice, corn, millet, sorghum, buckwheat, amaranth, and teff.
Flours: Almond flour, coconut flour, rice flour, tapioca flour, potato flour, and chickpea flour.
Starches: Arrowroot, tapioca starch, and potato starch.
Binders: Xanthan gum, guar gum, and psyllium husk.

Additionally, “creativity with whole food alternatives provides variety and nutrition. Cauliflower can replace wheat flour to make pizza crusts, crepes, or even rice. Sweet potatoes or squash can substitute for pasta, zucchini for lasagna noodles, portobello mushrooms for burger buns, and lettuce or cabbage leaves to wrap foods instead of tortillas or bread,” said Dr Rohatgi.",lifestyle

From Bengal to across the globe: ‘Bhaat ghum’ or afternoon siesta is a naptime revolution we didn’t know we needed,"Ever wished you could hit the snooze button after lunch? And did you know that a quick snooze can supercharge your brain like a phone charger for your noggin?
While in India the concept may not be very popular, except in West Bengal where it is called ‘bhaat ghum (a nap after eating rice)’, in the Mediterranean, you’ll find the ‘siesta’ to be a tradition in countries like Spain, Italy and Greece.
‘Bhaat ghum’ is not just an afternoon snooze, in fact, it is a blissful coma induced by a plate of soul-satisfying khichdi or a comforting bowl of dal bhaat (rice and pulses).Advertisement
And guess what? The age-old tradition of a four-hour break lives on even today in West Bengal, giving workers the perfect excuse for an afternoon siesta. So, if you see shops closing in West Bengal around midday, it’s not laziness – it’s a nod to history!

Delving deeper into the science behind these post-meal naps, in conversation with indianexpress.com, psychologist Dr Srikanth Srinivasan, Chief Medical Director, Niyama Digital Healthcare, revealed the benefits. He said, an afternoon siesta helps in improved mood, enhanced cognitive function and reduced stress levels.

He further highlighted the global presence of this practice, citing the popularity of the afternoon ‘siesta’ in Spain, believed to have spread to Latin America, Asia and Africa. He emphasised, “Given this long-established practice of an afternoon nap in the Indian subcontinent, it is unlikely to face any major cultural obstacle towards the dissemination of its health benefits.”
“Short naps of anywhere between 20 and 30 minutes taken between 3 pm and 5 pm (when there is a circadian dip in the body’s alertness) have been shown to maintain day time arousal levels and enhance performance across all age groups. Post lunch sleepiness occurs regardless of whether lunch is consumed or not,” Dr Srinivasan said.Advertisement
He added, “A decline in arousal in the afternoon could thus be considered to be a part of a biological rhythm. On the other hand, in older populations, as opposed to the obvious benefits of a midday nap outlined above, excessive napping has been linked with negative outcomes.”
He also mentioned that napping is actually better than caffeine for staying alert. “Naps have been shown to help with learning new things, remembering stuff better, boosting mood and even improving heart health by lowering the risk of high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity. They also help lower stress and boost your immune system,” Dr Srinivasan said.
 A traditional Bengali lunch will consist of rice, daal, potatoes, eggs, meat or fish. (Source: Pexels)
Dr Srinivasan said there is a negative aura surrounding after-meal naps and misinformation about how napping after lunch is a big obstacle to overcome. “Providing correct information and the self-agency to individuals to choose their work patterns – continuous shift or a pattern with a break built-in for a post-lunch nap — would be the right approach to promote this,” he said.
“Taking daytime naps is common in many cultures in tropical and semitropical climates, where afternoon temperatures often climb considerably. As an example, the ancient Ayurvedic physician Charaka, in his treatise ‘Charaka’, offered specific recommendations for daytime naps tailored to individuals of different body types,” Dr Srinivasan said.Advertisement
Addressing the challenge of integrating ‘bhaat ghum’ into modern work-life balance, Dr. Srinivasan offered practical suggestions. He said, “With the increasing popularity of work-from-home arrangements, encouraging institutions to designate protected nap times after lunch could be a valuable step. Even in traditional office settings, simply allowing employees to rest their heads on their desks and close their eyes without fear of judgment could make a significant difference.”
Sociologist Prateeti Rajak, bachelor’s degree holder in Sociology from Jamia Millia Islamia with a Masters in interdisciplinary humanities and social sciences from IIT Gandhinagar, said, “From fostering a sense of community to prioritising well-being over productivity, post-meal naps serve as a reminder to slow down and savour life’s simple pleasures.”
Being a Bengali herself, currently working with The Desai Foundation Trust as a Project Executive, Rajak draws parallels from her own experiences. “The idea is to take a good one-hour nap to enhance working abilities and rejuvenate on a hot humid day. It not only refreshes one but gives the energy to continue with one’s daily routine.”
Rajak added, “Usually it would be our mothers telling us to take a nap in the afternoon after returning from school and having lunch. This actually helped us grow into healthier children, feel less anxious and remove stress.”Advertisement
Lamenting that she misses her mid-afternoon naps, Rajak said, “Now, work pressure, caffeine fixes and glowing screens keep us chained to our desks. Forget unwinding, even the afternoon sun feels like a judgment when you’re stuck in an air-conditioned cubicle. Sleep? Most nights are a blur of catching up on what we missed while we were productive.”

Rajak acknowledged the limitations and said, “After a traditional lunch not all people can afford to listen to their heart and take a bhaat ghum. Househelps, working-class individuals and others are driven by the need to provide for their families.”
She lamented the decline of this practice across generations, attributing it to the “hyper-achieving mindset” that prioritises work and additional activities, leaving little time for rest, even for children whose parents strive to offer a better life.
Rajak’s research has revealed that communities like Marathis, Gujaratis and even the Japanese embrace this rejuvenating habit. Integrating similar practices into modern work cultures, akin to the Japanese model, could empower individuals to embrace a slower pace, recharge for the afternoon and potentially experience positive benefits.Advertisement
She added especially considering the increasing challenges posed by climate change and regional hardships, that this seemingly leisurely activity of taking a post-meal afternoon nap holds the potential to enhance both work output and our socio-emotional well-being.
Dietician Qudshiya Motiwala Imtiyaz, Nutrition Consultant, told indianexpress.com, “A balanced and mindful diet is always preferable. Our ancestors had scripted that one should eat only till his 75-80 per cent capacity or else it will invite unnecessary ailments to the body.”
“After a meal is done, our body releases serotonin enzymes which makes the body sleepy or drowsy. No one has the potential to work when they sleep. Their performance scale declines. So, if a nap or sleep is taken, we get fresh and can perform better in our tasks,” Imtiyaz said.
When asked what’s the best way for modern individuals who are handling 9 am to 5 pm jobs, Imtiyaz said, “Modern individuals should have healthy meals and consume it mindfully by keeping their culture and traditional food alive.”Advertisement
From the top of her head, she mentioned the balanced diet one can take if they choose to have an afternoon nap could include fish and rice, dal and rice and ghee, dal baati, litti chokha or idli-sambar.

“All cuisines have healthy tasty traditional food in their menu, so modern individuals can pick up and have that. It will help them to keep the tradition alive plus their body acceptability of that food item will increase as that food item has been consumed by their parents and grandparents so it’s in their blood and roots,” she said.
As advice, Imtiyaz said, “One should not eat in a hurry. Food is a blessing one should have with a peaceful mind and body. Sitting on the floor with crossed legs in front or crossed legs on the right hand side is our traditional method to consume food. This helps one to have control on their food intake. If these traditional ways are not followed or practised by modern individuals, they might be caught up with some illness or may have low immune response to any kind of sickness.”",lifestyle
Furry trims and nosy neighbours: How London Fashion Week turned 40,"Written by Elizabeth Paton
It was the Sunday of London Fashion Week and the last model had just stepped off the runway at the JW Anderson show. A heaving scrum soon descended on the designer, a sea of phones held aloft like antennas. Jonathan Anderson’s collection had been a nostalgic British jumble of chunky knits and trench coats, school uniform staples, retro thermal underwear sets and hats like Grandma’s gray pin-curl wigs, all chucked into a subversive tumble dryer for a warped take on what once felt familiar. Why?
“I was looking at ideas of ‘odd type’ characters in Britain, the nosy neighbor next door, but then slightly twisted into grotesque distortions and proportions,” Anderson said. He had been inspired by Generation Z’s constant remixing of the past, using the prism of technology or referencing bygone trends through streetwear.Advertisement
“I guess I was thinking about how Britain has changed,” he added, “and how we look at it in a completely new way.”
It was a fitting meditation for one of the country’s biggest fashion names, not least given the celebrations underway in honor of a momentous birthday: This season, London Fashion Week turned 40.
There were terrific clothes aplenty, from cornerstone names such as Molly Goddard, Erdem and Simone Rocha as well as fresher faces such as Dilara Findikoglu and 16Arlington. And a welcome return to the schedule by the 2015 LVMH Prize winner Marques’Almeida, its designer duo all grown up and with a scattering of sweet children as models.
From floral brows, big coats and lashings of fake fur to a seasoning of Hollywood stardust Sunday night thanks to a happy scheduling clash with the BAFTA Film Awards, here are five things that turned our heads this week.
A new ‘it’ color ruled the runways.Advertisement
The red runway trend may not be abating just yet, but a scarlet woman is so last season. She has been replaced by a classier, more understated lady, one who prefers a deeper shade, ranging from burgundy to oxblood, and oozes an aura of wealth, status and power.
At Roksanda, the sleek opening look — a plunging blazer in black cherry with statement shoulders matched with a layered tunic over pants — had actually made its public debut on Zendaya several days earlier at a London press junket for “Dune: Part Two,” while Emilia Wickstead plumped for dark, delicious glamour with ladylike pencil skirts and car coats in lustrous carmine leathers and sequins. Molly Goddard layered new ideas and shapes in shades of ruby using lashings of the brand’s hallmark tulle and Chet Lo, inspired this season by the Terracotta Army unearthed in China in the 1970s, had a rich earthiness to his signature spiky knitted designs. Time to hit the claret.
The pressure was on Daniel Lee at Burberry.
The stakes were sky high for Burberry this season — just like the flags that flew atop the giant black tent that the brand erected in Victoria Park for its runway show Monday night. The critical and commercial response to Daniel Lee’s wildly expensive first two collections as chief creative officer of Britain’s largest luxury house by sales had been tepid. Lately, the share price has been tanking, thanks to two profit warnings in three months. What could Lee — who famously brought major buzz back to Bottega Veneta in his previous role — pull out of the bag for his third Burberry outing?
The great and good of British supermodels, for one thing. Agyness Deyn, dressed in a green gaberdine trench and flared pants with yellow tartan turn ups, led a lineup of runway icons including Lily Cole, Karen Elson, Lily Donaldson, Edie Campbell and Naomi Campbell to a thumping retro Amy Winehouse soundtrack. They wore outerwear in nudes, olives and oatmeal that were designed to exude both coziness and style edge, from fuzzy duffle coats and leather belted field jackets to the strokable fringes and hems adorning almost every garment. Also on show were romantic plaid maxi-kilts and chunky scarves, ludicrously capacious bags, silver-tassel loafers and chunky boots for striding.
Stars of screen and stage were out and about.Advertisement
Thanks to the BAFTAs (the less said about that red carpet the better), the stars were in town and out on the front row. Rosamund Pike gave us a twirl at Molly Goddard, while Kristin Scott Thomas dazzled in emerald green at Erdem next to Lily James. Some even took to the runway themselves as Hari Nef opened for Dilara Findikoglu and Joanna Lumley appeared in a presentation for the hot jewelry brand Completedworks. Fun fact: Lumley’s character, Patsy Stone, in the TV show “Absolutely Fabulous” was based on Lynne Franks, the founder of London Fashion Week.
But the most A-list of guest rosters was at the BAFTA after-party staged by British Vogue and Tiffany & Co., where such homegrown party co-hosts as Emily Blunt and Emerald Fennell joined Chioma Nnadi, British Vogue’s newly installed head of editorial content, for what felt like her de facto coming out party. Cheers.
Dressing up is the new dressing down.
London often presents plenty for those who lust after grungy streetwear, but this season several major names stepped up to offer options for the glamour-hungry crowd. Shown in front of the disputed Parthenon marbles at the British Museum and inspired by American-Greek soprano Maria Callas, Erdem delivered sumptuous draped cocktail dresses and embellished skirt suits, grand operatic capes and fluffy flat marabou slippers, as well as earrings in the shape of gilded roses, like the real ones thrown at the end of a diva’s performance. Richard Quinn placed clients for his timeless couture-like creations and burgeoning bridal business on the front row of his salon style show, which had been swathed in 900 meters (2,950 feet) of his signature floral fabric.
But it was Marco Capaldo of 16Arlington — the 2023 winner of the British Fashion Council/Vogue Designer Fashion Fund — whose slinky vision of sophistication felt the most current. His fuzzy oversize handbags and knits, sheer paneled frocks and shimmering silver evening pieces may have been inspired by misunderstood monsters and have had animalistic touches, but there was a simple beauty to his sleight of hand that makes Capaldo one to watch.

You don’t often see laced hot pants, corsets, nipples and naked flesh in traditional places of worship, but then Dilara Findikoglu is not exactly your traditional label. After canceling her show last season because of liquidity issues, Findikoglu made a triumphant, sexually charged return Sunday night with a collection that railed against toxic masculinity.
“This is a manifesto for a world order born of an unrelenting vortex of femme energy; the bringing of a new world to life through mass ritual,” she said in her show notes about the deconstructed corporate suiting and shirting teamed with boned underwear, PVC pieces, knickers made from silver keys and a white feathered cocktail gown. “This is the imagining of the world that I know can put ours to right.”
Findikoglu was looking for new beginnings. But with her show, called the Wake, Simone Rocha closed the final chapter of a triptych that began last season with the Dress Rehearsal and continued last month with the Procession, her nuptials-themed couture collection for Jean Paul Gaultier. Presented Saturday night in a 12th-century church, St. Bartholomew-the-Great, the collection was inspired by Queen Victoria’s mourning attire after the death of her husband, Prince Albert.
Corsetry glistened with crystal embellishments while faux fur stoles lay over shoulders, and backs were covered in translucent wisps of organza tailoring. Models — some of whom had winding rose briers painted over their eyebrows — clutched soft-toy handbags shaped like lambs and processioned in Rocha’s wildly popular rhinestone-encrusted Crocs. The devil was in the details.",lifestyle
Top 5 picks for healthy skin,"In an era where skincare has become an indispensable part of our self-care routines, the pursuit of healthy, radiant skin has reached new heights. Other than DIY remedies and products constantly flooding the skincare scene, nature has its own goodies to transform your skin from the inside out. Recently, nutritionist Lovneet Batra took to Instagram to share her top five picks for achieving and maintaining skin health.
“Dive into our glow-getter’s guide for radiant, healthy skin using nature’s bounty. From the antioxidant power of lycopene to the hydration hero Vitamin E, discover how everyday foods can be your ultimate beauty allies. Ready to eat your way to glowing skin?” she captioned the post.

Lycopene

Deeming it “your skin’s personal bodyguard,” Batra noted that lycopene is a powerful antioxidant that acts like a natural sunscreen. “Research shows lycopene can reduce sunburn by up to 40%, making it a must for your anti-aging arsenal,” she said.Advertisement
Individuals can consume cooked tomatoes, watermelons, and papaya to get their daily dose of lycopene.

Isoflavones

Isoflavones are plant estrogens that make your skin bouncy. “Clinical studies indicate isoflavones improve skin thickness and elasticity, visibly reducing fine lines,” Batra explained.
Natural sources of isoflavones include soy milk and tofu, which can be used in smoothies or paneer recipes, as well as lentils that are a staple part of Indian diets.

Vitamin C

According to Batra, vitamin C is the cornerstone of a bright, even-toned complexion. “A daily dose of 75-90 mg can significantly boost collagen, vital for skin strength and elasticity,” she said.Advertisement
Apart from vitamin C-rich products like masks and serums, you can find an abundance of it in amla (Indian gooseberry), guava, and green and red bell peppers.

Omega-3

Known for its nourishing properties, Omega-3s can “reduce the occurrence of acne and skin redness by up to 42%,” said Batra. Foods like alsi (flaxseeds), walnuts, and chia seeds are rich in Omega-3 fatty acids that can help you achieve smooth, clear skin.

Vitamin E

A skin-protecting antioxidant that locks in hydration, vitamin E is the “moisture maven.” “Applying vitamin E can reduce UV damage in the skin, and when eaten, it works wonders in moisturising skin from within,” Batra explained.

"Consider getting keratin, cysteine, or hair Botox treatments? Here’s what to keep in mind","Are you tired of dealing with frizzy, unmanageable hair? Well, popular hair treatments such as keratin, cysteine, and hair Botox have been making waves in the beauty industry for quite some time now. If you’re considering trying one of these, it’s essential to understand the differences between these treatments and their effects on your hair. Dr Aanchal Panth took to Instagram to advise some cautionary steps before you make the decision.
Dr Panth emphasises that it’s crucial to recognise that none of these treatments actually strengthen your hair or replenish lost protein. “These will only make your hair manageable, reducing your grooming time,” she added.
Here’s the breakdown of keratin, cysteine, and hair Botox treatments:Advertisement
1. Keratin Treatment
According to Dr Panth, keratin treatments involve the use of either formaldehyde or glyoxylic acid to break the disulphide bonds in hair, straightening and smoothing the hair shaft. This results in hair that appears straighter, smoother, and shinier. The effects typically last up to four months, but after six months, hair may become frizzier and more unmanageable due to breaks in the hair shaft.
She recommends it only for individuals with frizzy, unmanageable hair, especially those who regularly use heating tools. It’s essential to maintain a short haircut and use appropriate shampoos and conditioners to minimise further hair damage.
While keratin treatments can provide long-lasting effects compared to others, Dr DM Mahajan, dermatologist, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, told indianexpress.com that as it contains formaldehyde, it could pose risks of irritation or allergic reactions, necessitating careful consideration and adherence to safety protocols during application.
2. Cysteine Treatment
To alter the shape of the hair, Dr Panth explains that cysteine treatment uses glyoxylic acid, cysteine, and acetic acid. However, unlike keratin treatment, it doesn’t completely break the disulphide bonds, making it less damaging to the hair shaft. The downside is that it lasts for a shorter period and comes with a higher cost.Advertisement
Dr Panth suggests it is suitable for those with similar indications as keratin but only if you’re willing to invest more and undergo treatments regularly. Otherwise, this option is not preferable.
Agreeing, Dr Mahajan said that it offers a milder alternative without the use of harsh chemicals. “This approach appeals to individuals with sensitive scalps or those preferring a more natural option. However, the duration of results is shorter compared to keratin treatments, making periodic maintenance necessary.”

3. Hair Botox
Hair Botox entails using a mixture of oils, vitamin B5, and vitamin E to seal the cuticle without breaking the bonds in the hair shaft, said Dr Panth. However, it’s only considered a “patchwork” solution for damaged hair that lasts for 2-3 months.
It is advisable only for individuals with dry, frizzy, or colour-treated hair, as it can help enhance shine and manageability.
Dr Panth cautions that all three treatments involve the use of strong chemicals and heat, which can be damaging to the hair. So, if you already have healthy hair, it’s recommended to avoid these altogether, but those struggling with unmanageable hair may consider them.Advertisement
On similar lines, Dr Mahajan noted that the efficacy of hair Botox can vary based on individual hair characteristics, adding that occasional reapplication may be necessary to maintain desired results.

Start your day right! 5 foods to eat on an empty stomach,"The way you begin your day sets the tone for the hours ahead, and choosing the right foods to kickstart your morning can have a significant impact on your overall health and well-being. Eating the right foods on an empty stomach can jumpstart your metabolism, provide essential nutrients, and boost your energy levels. Nutritionist Sakshi Lalwani took to Instagram to share five foods you can eat on an empty stomach to improve your health.


Jayfal or Nutmeg Powder


Nisha Mandal, consultant dietician, and nutritionist at Motherhood Hospitals, Gurgaon, tells indianexpress.com that consuming nutmeg powder on an empty stomach has several benefits.
“It is believed to aid digestion by stimulating the production of digestive enzymes and promoting gastric motility, which can help alleviate symptoms of indigestion and bloating. Nutmeg is rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds, which may help boost immunity and reduce inflammation in the body when taken before meals,” she said.Advertisement
Mandal noted that nutmeg should not be consumed empty stomach during pregnancy. However, being rich in dietary fibre, it can alleviate pregnancy-related discomfort.
She cautions that an overdose of nutmeg can lead to an upset gut and even intoxication. “A safe dosage would be 1 mg per day.”


Anjeer or Fig


According to Mandal, figs are high in fibre and contain vitamins and minerals such as potassium and calcium. “Consuming figs before breakfast may promote satiety and help control appetite throughout the day, making them a nutritious addition to your morning routine.”
Additionally, figs are advised to pregnant women as they are rich in iron, folate, and fibre, which support fetal development and prevent neural tube defects. “On an empty stomach, figs aid in better bowel movements and higher energy levels,” Mandal said.Advertisement


Methi Dana (Fenugreek Seeds) and Ginger


While fenugreek seeds are known for their ability to regulate blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity, ginger has anti-nausea and anti-inflammatory properties that can help soothe digestive discomfort.
“Together, methi dana and ginger can aid digestion, reduce bloating, and promote overall gut health when consumed on an empty stomach,” Mandal advised. However, pregnant women should steer clear of it on an empty stomach.


Haleem Seeds (Garden Cress Seeds)


Haleem seeds are packed with nutrients, including iron, calcium, and vitamins C and E, which are essential for maintaining healthy blood and bones. Additionally, haleem seeds are believed to have medicinal properties that can help improve respiratory health and boost immunity.
Mandal recommends consuming them before breakfast as it can enhance nutrient absorption and promote overall well-being. “Consuming it with vitamin C-rich fruits can aid digestion and increase absorption of iron from haleem seeds. One teaspoon of haleem seeds daily fulfills 60 per cent of the iron requirement, making it beneficial during pregnancy.”Advertisement


Horse Gram Powder


Starting your day with horse gram powder can help regulate blood sugar levels, improve digestion, and promote weight loss due to its high fibre and low glycemic index. Horse gram also has a variety of medicinal and culinary benefits due to its protein and fibre-rich content.

Starting with the woman of the hour — Radhika — wearing a cream and mint green lehenga, looked stunning. Her gorgeous lehenga was adorned with floral motifs, intricate kadhai work, and gold sequin embroidery. She complemented it with a matching blouse and sheer dupatta. Adding to the allure were her jewellery pieces, which included a diamond necklace, maang tikka, earrings, and bracelets. Her half-up half-down hairdo and rosy makeup rounded it off. Radhika’s outfit was a refreshing take on floral silhouettes reminiscent of the spring season.

4. Don’t try crash dieting
Resist the urge to compensate for indulgence by resorting to crash diets. Starving yourself is neither sustainable nor healthy. Instead, listen to your body and eat according to hunger cues rather than attempting drastic measures.
5. Don’t skip meals
Skipping meals in an attempt to “make up” for overindulgence is counterproductive. It can slow down your metabolism and lead to unhealthy eating patterns. Consistency and balance are key for sustainable weight management.

Additionally, Ritika Samaddar, regional head – south zone, nutrition and dietetics, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket told indianexpress.com that making small changes while eating out can also make a difference.Advertisement
“Firstly, eat out only once or maximum twice a week. Cut down on portion size. Avoid consuming sweetened beverages and instead opt for fresh lime water, coconut water or chaas (butter milk). Always order a plate of salad or a vegetable soup as a side dish, as it will fill you up sooner, keeping calorie intake low. Hydrating well with plain water will also satiate you. Lastly, most restaurants mention the calories content of the food items, so read the labels or nutrition facts before ordering,” she said.
Remember to prioritise balance and moderation in your eating habits to support your overall well-being. By following these simple yet effective tips, you can enjoy eating out without the worry of unwanted weight gain.",lifestyle
This is why Shilpa Shetty Kundra’s yoga routine deserves your rapt attention,"Trust Shilpa Shetty Kundra to always give fitness goals! Whether Pilates, gymming, or yoga, the Indian Police Force actor always manages to capture our rapt attention. As such, when she demonstrated a yogic routine for flexibility and balance, we took note. “Yoga is my ‘go-to’… at home or on a vacation or back from a vacation. So, today’s routine included the Virabhadrasana and Skandasana, which when done together is a great combination exercise,” said Shilpa.
According to the 48-year-old, the combination of Virabhadrasana (Warrior Pose) and Skandasana (Side Lunge Pose) in a yoga practice is beneficial for strengthening the thigh and core muscles. “It also improves balance, increases hip and pelvic flexibility, and gives a deep stretch to the groin, hamstrings, and adductor muscles. It’s also a great exercise that increases one’s flexibility for more challenging asanas,” said Shilpa.
Know more about the combination of these asanas.
These two poses, when performed together, create a synergistic effect that targets various muscle groups, enhances flexibility, improves balance, and fosters a sense of focus and calmness, said fitness expert Garima Goyal.Advertisement
Virabhadrasana, often referred to as Warrior Pose, comes in different variations, with Warrior I, II, and III being the most common. Goyal mentioned that these poses primarily engage the lower body, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, and hip flexors. “Additionally, they stimulate the muscles of the core, shoulders, and arms, promoting strength and stability,” said Goyal.
When integrating Skandasana into the sequence, the focus shifts to the inner thighs, groin, and hip adductors. “Skandasana, or Side Lunge Pose, involves a deep lateral stretch and requires flexibility in the hips and groin. It complements Virabhadrasana by enhancing the range of motion in the hips and providing a stretch to different muscle groups,” Goyal mentioned.
The combination of Virabhadrasana and Skandasana creates a dynamic flow, encouraging practitioners to “move seamlessly between strength-building and flexibility-enhancing postures“. Goyal said that the transitions between these poses promote joint mobility and improve functional fitness. The fluidity of movement helps in developing a more profound mind-body connection, fostering mindfulness and concentration, said Goyal.

As both poses require a strong foundation and engagement of the core, they contribute to better posture and spinal alignment. “This, in turn, can alleviate issues related to poor posture, such as lower back pain. The elongation of the spine in Virabhadrasana and the lateral stretch in Skandasana work together to promote a healthy and aligned spine,” Goyal added.

Beyond the physical benefits, the practice of Virabhadrasana and Skandasana together has profound mental and emotional effects. “The focus required to maintain balance and stability in these poses cultivates mindfulness and concentration. The intentional breathwork integrated into the practice enhances the mind-body connection, promoting relaxation and stress relief,” said Goyal.",lifestyle
‘Memoirs are for legends… I’m happy telling stories!’: Jugal Hansraj on writing for children,"Remember the popular children’s song ‘Lakdi ki Kathi’ from the movie Masoom? If yes, then you probably recollect the young hazel-eyed boy in it who won over many hearts with his innocent charm. Meet Jugal Hansraj, an actor, film writer, and director who decided to give his creativity some freedom and turned author with Cross Connection: The Big Circus Adventure in 2017. Seven years later, he has written two more books (published by HarperCollins) and is penning the third in the series for children.
As his third book The Jewel of Nisawa (sequel to the acclaimed The Coward & The Sword) released, we asked the Mohabbatein actor about his journey, the different hats he has worn over the years, writing for children, the role of social media today, and if we can expect an autobiography from him. Read the edited excerpts below:

But if you had to pick one of the three, which would you and why?
Since all three are creative, the good thing is I don’t need to choose! I’m taking up acting projects again, and still writing when I’m not on a shooting schedule. It feels good that the recent work I did on camera has been appreciated as have the books.
This is your second book in the series; how was the response to the first one?Advertisement
Firstly I’m both elated and honoured to have them published by HarperCollins. The fact that they liked it enough to publish it was the best first response I could hope for. After that, it’s gotten a great response from the readers. So many people, young and old, have told me they not only enjoyed the book immensely but even appreciated the message in it – if only that message of peace could be replicated in today’s world.

However, in a 2021 interview with us, you mentioned that you were already writing the sequel and planned to wrap it up by the following year. What took you so long?
Some acting assignments in between, summer holidays when my son is home all day from school, and the fact that I wanted to make the second book even better and deeper, and yet more engaging and entertaining, took some time. It’s even longer than the first. All these factors, plus the detailed readings, corrections, and feedback from the editors took time but only helped create a better book. I’m already working on book three in the series and am working harder to make it even better than the second one!
At a time when celebrities are penning their memoirs, why did you decide to turn author with a children’s book?
Memoirs are for legends and I’m not there. I do have a long journey in the film world which I could talk about but only if I know that readers would be interested in my experiences. Not until then. I enjoy the fiction space as it gives my creativity freedom which oftentimes one doesn’t get as a director as there are so many factors involved. I also enjoy giving young readers something positive to think about as they read, as this is the age to put some positive influence on them. I hope I succeed in doing that.Advertisement

Also, it is not more challenging to write to kids of the digital era — whose attention spans are diminishing by the day.
That is very true. Sad, but true. I’m quite happy that my generation didn’t have that issue while growing up. We played outdoors, were rougher and tumble growing up, and also spent a lot of time with comics and books where we got to imagine how the characters would look, etc. Therefore, it does present a big challenge when young readers today have so many distractions. I do hope reading is encouraged by parents and schools.

If you had to sell your book to a child, how would you convince them?
Though my message is based on peace, love, courage, and Nichiren Buddhist principles, I’ve tried to weave a fascinating fantasy to convince them to read it. The fact that story is for young readers but also has young characters in them, with the same trials and tribulations, self-doubts, victories, and friendships that they face today. It’s a story about friendship and courage that I can convince them with. The beautiful illustrations in the book are also very attractive to young readers. That helps them pick the book up. The story then takes care of the rest.
You have been honest and open about your Bollywood journey, even sharing that you were considered a jinx. Do you think it would have been different had you started your career now, in the time of social media? If yes, how?Advertisement
Social media is a double-edged sword. It does allow you to say your piece, whereas earlier you were liable to be misquoted by film magazines or at the mercy almost of their perception of you. Now you can present yourself in the way you like, directly to the people. But it can be too much of a good thing too. I got into social media only about the pandemic. A small reason was also due to some write-ups about how I’m finished, how I’m not doing well etc. So it was my way of saying, I’m here, and doing better than you think I am (haha!) And also there’s a small section of people who still remember me, and admire my work in the films and now in writing so it’s for them. I do limit my usage and appearance on platforms as overkill is also a real thing. The other negative part about it is the negativity one sometimes has to face with people hiding behind comments to say mean things. It’s very easy to be a critic, and extremely difficult to create. They should try it sometime.

How did your son react to The Coward and The Sword? Did you take his ideas/inputs for the sequel?
My son is too young to read these books. He is still at the basic reading stage. But he is the inspiration behind me writing these books. I began ‘The Coward and the Sword’ after I became a father, after my wife Jasmine and I were blessed with our son.
What more can expect from you in 2024?Advertisement
My third book in the series is progressing well, but I doubt very much it will come out in ‘24. Hopefully it can be out in ‘25. On the acting front, I have a very interesting series which I’ve acted in, titled ‘Nanda Devi’. It is directed by Rohan Khambati, definitely a director to watch out for. The show should be out later this year. And I’m currently shooting for a couple of interesting projects as an actor, which will be out in ‘24 or ‘25. So there’s a good amount of interesting work happening.
Any plans of converting your books to a film or series?
Definitely! I do believe the three books, can be made into a beautiful trilogy of films or one season of a show/series per book. It has potential to be very rich visually as well as in content. Fingers crossed!",lifestyle
New study decodes the deep connection between eating disorders and depression,"Recent research published in Cureus: Journal of Medical Science found an intrinsic link between eating disorders and depression. A cross-sectional study conducted in Saudi Arabia among adolescents found that the more severe the depressive symptoms were, the higher the prevalence of eating disorders existed.
The study noted that patients diagnosed with eating disorders (EDs) demonstrated higher risks of eating psychopathology, including distorted body image, and general psychopathology, such as depression, anxiety, impulsivity, and low self-esteem, surpassing anticipated levels. “Moreover, our findings underscored the pivotal role of age in influencing the prevalence of these conditions, as younger adolescents emerged as a distinct risk group susceptible to both EDs and depression,” it said.
In fact, according to a study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2019, the global eating disorder prevalence increased from 3.4 per cent to 7.8 per cent between 2000 and 2018.Advertisement
Concurring with the findings, Dr Jyoti Kapoor, founder-director and senior psychiatrist at Manasthali, told indianexpress.com that depression and eating disorders frequently co-occur. “Individuals with eating disorders often experience symptoms of depression, such as persistent sadness, feelings of worthlessness, and loss of interest in activities they once enjoyed. Conversely, people with depression may develop disordered eating patterns as a way to cope with their emotional distress.”

Dr Priyanka Rohatgi, chief nutritionist at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, added that a negative reinforcement cycle exists between depression and eating disorders. “Depression’s impact on motivation, energy levels, and self-care can make unhealthy eating habits spiral out of control more easily. Additionally, the starvation, binging, and purging behaviors associated with eating disorders can exacerbate mood disorders due to their effects on brain chemistry.”
However, it’s crucial to recognise that eating disorders are more prevalent than officially reported. “Factors like stigma, societal pressure, and a lack of awareness contribute to the underreporting of individuals struggling with disordered eating,” Dr Saras Prasad, consultant in psychiatry at Yatharth Super Speciality Hospital, Noida Extension, explained.

For effective treatment, it is essential to address both the eating disorder symptoms and underlying psychological factors. “A combination of therapy modalities including cognitive-behavioral therapy and dialectical behavioural therapy, along with medications, can help manage both conditions concurrently,” said Dr Rohatgi. “Understanding the psychology behind eating disorders leads to more empathetic, holistic care,” she added.",lifestyle
When Karisma Kapoor spoke about losing 25 kilos with simple diet tweaks,"Throwbacks are the flavour of the season, so what’s better than revisiting some of the revelations made by celebrities about their diets and how they aimed to make them sustainable? When we stumbled upon this 2015 video of Karisma Kapoor discussing her diet with celebrity nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar, we couldn’t help but notice how small tweaks can make a big difference not only to your goals but also to your energy and stress levels.
Kapoor, in a conversation with Diwekar, talked about losing 25 kilos with just eating fish curry and rice every night for dinner. “I lost 25 kilos eating fish curry with rice every night. When I tell my friends they are surprised that you can eat carbs at night and still lose weight. You have taught me how to eat right, how to eat what I like, eat carbs, and lose weight the correct way,” Kapoor said in the interview posted on Diwekar’s official YouTube page.
She added, “It has become a way of life for me, and I endorse it wherever I go. I tell people to not starve themselves and resort to Nimbu Paani (lemonade) and some leaves, etc. That kind of weight will all come back.”Advertisement
On some of her favourite snacks, Kapoor mentioned that poha is a great with chillies thrown in, and upma with lots of vegetables is an even healthier option. “I love eating all that. So, you don’t feel deprived. You don’t feel that I can’t eat these Indian yummy snacks. It is not just boiled carrots, cucumbers, etc. You can eat normal household food and still be on your fitness journey.”

She also advocated for fruits like bananas and sapotas (chikoos), which are often perceived as fruits that contribute to weight gain. “Bananas and chikoos are nutritious and give you great energy levels when you are working, or a bit stressed out or have a busy day or taking a flight. It is such a great option as it fills you up, and you will get all your nutrients and energy too!” said Kapoor.
Taking a leaf out of her diet dairy, here are nutrition experts explaining the significance of sticking to simple diet tweaks.

Embracing a diet centered around home-cooked meals like fish and rice for dinner showcases the efficacy of wholesome, balanced eating habits. “While this approach may work for some, individual responses to dietary changes vary,” said Nupuur Patil, nutritionist, Nupuur Patil Fitness.
Patil mentioned that simple diet tweaks, such as increasing vegetable intake, opting for lean protein sources, and limiting processed foods and sugary beverages, can further enhance results.Advertisement

What’s so special about a rainbow-check scarf?,"Written by
Misty White Sidell
The rainbow-check pattern is hard to miss.
It can be spotted on scarves in cities across the world, including somewhere temperatures rarely approach freezing. Those scarves come in many palettes, and they can be purchased for hundreds of dollars at department stores or for tens of dollars from street vendors. They are worn by various people and are as likely to be seen on subways as they are through the windows of chauffeured cars.
The original mohair-blend design was introduced by Acne Studios in 2019. At more than 8 feet long, the style, called Vally, costs $320 and is almost as much a blanket as it is a scarf, an accessory that is typically between 4 and 6 feet in length.Advertisement
The Swedish brand had been selling extra-long scarves for years before releasing the rainbow-check Vally, said Mattias Magnusson, Acne Studios’ CEO. The scarf, he added, was inspired by a vintage chair upholstered in a plush, sorbet-plaid fabric.
“Our team got excited about concepting ideas based on it,” Magnusson said.
Like other Acne scarves, it can be identified by a large, white, rectangular tag that was developed to resemble labels on wool blankets like those from centuries-old brands such as Hudson’s Bay and Woolrich. Magnusson said some people have started to wear the scarf with its tag facing outward to show its provenance.
A representative for Acne Studios said sales of the rainbow-check Vally had increased each year since it was introduced. The style is sold at more than 380 locations — a mix of Acne stores and other retailers — across the world, the representative added, including the brand’s store in Singapore, where temperatures rarely drop below 75 degrees Fahrenheit. (It has sold out at that location, the representative said.)Advertisement
Thom Bettridge, the head of creative and content at the e-commerce site Ssense, which has sold the style since 2019, said its popularity had “a lot to do with internet outfit culture” and was “an indicator of how much of our culture is user generated rather than dictated.”
“It’s not everywhere because a celebrity wore it,” Bettridge said. “It’s grassroots rather than top-down.”

Rickie De Sole, the women’s fashion director at Nordstrom, which has also sold the style since 2019, described it as a good foil for minimalist attire. “It gives a hit of color if you are wearing a more pared-back outfit,” she said. She could not recall another style of scarf that has become as widely embraced in recent years. “Not to my memory,” she said.
Those that have gravitated to the design include people catering to a crowd seeking the look at a lower cost. There are Reddit threads explaining how to knit DIY versions, while knockoffs are sold by AliExpress, a Chinese e-commerce site known for selling counterfeit goods, as well as by street vendors in New York that some may associate more with cheap pashminas than with luxury-good duplicates.Advertisement
Ann Buenaobra, a 31-year-old consultant in Los Angeles, said she and her sister bought three Vally “dupes” from a sidewalk vendor in New York last winter at $20 per piece. (She chronicled her shopping spree in a TikTok video that has received nearly 10,000 views.)
She likes the version she bought for its size, weave and fuzzy texture. “It feels really unique,” Buenaobra said.
But as the style has proliferated, some have described it another way: ubiquitous. Mark Boutilier, a 26-year-old content creator in Brooklyn, shared a video on TikTok and Instagram in January jabbing at the accessory’s prevalence and encouraging his more than 200,000 combined followers on both apps to wear different scarves.
Boutilier’s video, which has received more than 730,000 total views, has drawn comments in defense of the style and others agreeing with his assessment. “Acne scarves got Washington Square Park in a chokehold,” wrote one commenter on Instagram.Advertisement

“Acne scarves tie into the kind of memes that would say, ‘If you see this scarf in your neighborhood, your rent is going up,’” Boutilier, whose content focuses on menswear trends, said in an interview.
Magnusson of Acne Studios had a different reaction to the style’s prevalence. “I wish I had copyrighted it,” he said.

Does maida or refined flour stick to your gut lining? Experts weigh in,"As the diet and fitness world evolves, so do the myths surrounding various food items. One such revolves around maida, also known as all-purpose flour or refined flour. Many believe that maida sticks to the walls of the gut or the gut lining, leading to digestive troubles. But how accurate is this claim? Nutritionist Amita Gadre recently addressed this issue on Instagram, debunking it as one of the most persistent myths.
“Maida does not stick to your gut. Even if maida/refined flour is sticky — no one is eating the dough as is, and even if you did — it would undergo systematic digestion and breakdown in our digestive system and then get absorbed in our body as simple carbohydrates,” said Gadre.
According to her, nothing can stick to your gut, as it is a very dynamic and active organ.Advertisement
To verify this, and to understand the right way to include maida in our meals, we decided to reach out to experts.
Dietitian Simrat Bhui noted that no scientific claims suggest that maida sticks to one’s gut lining. “Maida is low in fibre and does not hold much water, therefore eating it regularly can lead to constipation and other digestive disorders. But the process of digesting the cooked maida item will be the same. So, eating maida base items on an occasional basis does not harm, however excess of anything is harmful,” she said.

While it’s true that there is no immediate risk with its consumption, maida does pose a serious problem in the long run and is something you should avoid for good health. “Besides maida being low in fibre and very high in glycemic index, which spikes blood sugar, the bigger problem with it is its high content of gluten,” said functional nutritionist Mugdha Pradhan, CEO and founder, iThrive.
While maida may contribute to digestive discomfort in some individuals, its effects can vary depending on factors such as overall diet, hydration, and individual digestive health, said Dr Vikas Jindal, consultant, Dept of Gastroenterology, CK Birla Hospital, Delhi. “Consuming maida in moderation as part of a balanced diet is unlikely to cause significant digestive issues for most people.”Advertisement

Adding, Pradhan said, “Gluten is a plant compound found primarily in wheat amongst other plants and is very bad for your gut health and known to damage the gut. And since your gut lies at the core of your health and affects every other organ, gluten ends up being bad for your overall health.”

Gluten negatively affects everyone irrespective of whether you suffer from a serious gluten allergy (Celiac disease) or a milder gluten sensitivity (non-celiac gluten sensitivity) which is rampant and estimated to affect up to 30 percent of the population. “Gluten damages the gut in the long run and leads to a condition called leaky gut, which is a major contributor to most diseases today,” said Pradhan.
While maida may not directly stick to the gut, choosing whole grains and minimising processed foods can contribute to better digestive health and overall wellness.",lifestyle
5 steps to ensure your needs are fulfilled in your relationship,"Finding the delicate balance between giving and receiving is essential for a fulfilling relationship. Whether you’re in the early stages of your relationship or in a long-term commitment, having your relationship needs met is important to strengthen your connection.
Adding to this, Sidhharrth S Kumaar, a relationship coach at NumroVani, emphasises the potential consequences of unmet needs, noting that they can lead to feelings of frustration, disappointment, and resentment. “Relationships in which partners prioritise meeting each other’s needs are more likely to stand the test of time.”
If you’re wondering where to begin, Sadaf Siddiqi, a psychotherapist, took to Instagram to share 5 steps to ensure your needs are met in a relationship.Advertisement
Identify what’s missing
The first step, Siddiqi says, is to identify what’s missing in your relationship — whether it’s communication, quality time, or intimacy and adventure.
To do this, Kumaar advises looking back at your previous and current relationships to see what you found particularly fulfilling or lacking. “Take the time to reflect on your emotional, physical, and mental requirements within the relationship. Understanding what you need is the base of any strong relationship.”
Share the facts
Once you’ve identified your relationship needs, the next step is to communicate this with your partner. “Open, transparent, and authentic communication is key,” says Kumaar, adding that “without these conversations, it is challenging to meet each other’s needs.”
When communicating your needs, be specific and provide examples. “Vague communication can lead to misunderstandings, whereas clarity in expression helps your partner understand your expectations and creates a more proactive approach,” Kumaar notes.Advertisement
State your feelings about the need using an “I”
Siddiqi recommends always using “I” statements while expressing your needs as it is less accusatory and enhances understanding. For example: “I feel lonely when I don’t hear from you for days at a time,” “I feel overwhelmed when I don’t have time to decompress alone,” “I miss exploring places with you.”
Explain your need to help the other person better understand its importance
To make your partner understand how important this relationship need is for you, Kumaar advises stating the need clearly and how it’ll help your connection.
Citing examples, Siddiqi uses these statements, “I need more regular communication to feel more connected to you,” “Having time to myself helps me be more present when we’re together,” “Traveling together is a way for me to share my interests with you.”

“Expressing your needs doesn’t guarantee that they will be met right away (or even at all). It may take continued conversations about how certain needs impact you or make you feel. However, without these steps, the other person may not know how important something is to you or how they can actually meet your needs,” Siddiqi concludes.",lifestyle
Run out of butter or eggs? Here’s the science behind substitute ingredients,"It’s an all too common situation – you’re busy cooking or baking to a recipe when you open the cupboard and suddenly realise you are missing an ingredient.
Unless you can immediately run to the shops, this can leave you scrambling for a substitute that can perform a similar function. Thankfully, such substitutes can be more successful than you’d expect.
There are a few reasons why certain ingredient substitutions work so well. This is usually to do with the chemistry and the physical features having enough similarity to the original ingredient to still do the job appropriately.Advertisement
Let’s delve into some common ingredient substitutions and why they work – or need to be tweaked.
Oils versus butter
Both butter and oils belong to a chemical class called lipids. It encompasses solid, semi-solid and liquid fats.
In a baked product the “job” of these ingredients is to provide flavour and influence the structure and texture of the finished item. In cake batters, lipids contribute to creating an emulsion structure – this means combining two liquids that wouldn’t usually mix. In the baking process, this helps to create a light, fluffy crumb.
One of the primary differences between butter and oil is that butter is only about 80% lipid (the rest being water), while oil is almost 100% lipid. Oil creates a softer crumb but is still a great fat to bake with.Advertisement
You can use a wide range of oils from different sources, such as olive oil, rice bran, avocado, peanut, coconut, macadamia and many more. Each of these may impart different flavours.
Other “butters”, such as peanut and cashew butter, aren’t strictly butters but pastes. They impart different characteristics and can’t easily replace dairy butter, unless you also add extra oil.
Aquafaba or flaxseed versus eggs
Aquafaba is the liquid you drain from a can of legumes – such as chickpeas or lentils. It contains proteins, kind of how egg white also contains proteins.
The proteins in egg white include albumins, and aquafaba also contains albumins. This is why it is possible to make meringue from egg whites, or from aquafaba if you’re after a vegan version.
The proteins act as a foam stabiliser – they hold the light, airy texture in the product. The concentration of protein in egg white is a bit higher, so it doesn’t take long to create a stable foam. Aquafaba requires more whipping to create a meringue-like foam, but it will bake in a similar way.
Another albumin-containing alternative for eggs is flaxseed. These seeds form a thick gel texture when mixed with a little water. The texture is similar to raw egg and can provide structure and emulsification in baked recipes that call for a small amount of egg white.
 Here are some substitutes to try (Source: Pixabay)
Lemon plus dairy versus buttermilkAdvertisement
Buttermilk is the liquid left over after churning butter – it can be made from sweet cream, cultured/sour cream or whey-based cream. Buttermilk mostly contains proteins and fats.
Cultured buttermilk has a somewhat tangy flavour. Slightly soured milk can be a good substitute as it contains similar components and isn’t too different from “real” buttermilk, chemically speaking.
One way to achieve slightly soured milk is by adding some lemon juice or cream of tartar to milk. Buttermilk is used in pancakes and baked goods to give extra height or volume. This is because the acidic (sour) components of buttermilk interact with baking soda, producing a light and airy texture.
Buttermilk can also influence flavour, imparting a slightly tangy taste to pancakes and baked goods. It can also be used in sauces and dressings if you’re looking for a lightly acidic touch.
Honey versus sugar
Honey is a complex sugar-based syrup that includes floral or botanical flavours and aromas. Honey can be used in cooking and baking, adding both flavour and texture (viscosity, softness) to a wide range of products.
If you add honey instead of regular sugar in baked goods, keep in mind that honey imparts a softer, moister texture. This is because it contains more moisture and is a humectant (that is, it likes to hold on to water). It is also less crystalline than sugar, unless you leave it to crystallise.Advertisement
The intensity of sweetness can also be different – some people find honey is sweeter than its granular counterpart, so you will want to adjust your recipes accordingly.
Gluten-free versus regular flour
Sometimes you need to make substitutions to avoid allergens, such as gluten – the protein found in cereal grains such as wheat, rye, barley and others.

Unfortunately, gluten is also the component that gives a nice, stretchy, squishy quality to bread.
To build this characteristic in a gluten-free product, it’s necessary to have a mixture of ingredients that work together to mimic this texture. Common ingredients used are corn or rice flour, xanthan gum, which acts as a binder and moisture holder, and tapioca starch, which is a good water absorbent and can aid with binding the dough.",lifestyle
Is foxtail millet richest source of protein? Nutrition experts weigh in,"The variety that millet boasts is huge and can be incorporated into your diet routine. But if you are looking especially for a protein meal, it is important to know which type of millet is the richest source of protein to help you plan your meals. As such, nutritionist Juhi Kapoor shared that there is a millet for every need. “There is a millet for everyone. If you are looking for high protein millet to attain muscle gain, tissue maintenance, and even to help weight loss – the richest protein millet is foxtail millet,” said Kapoor.
Citing APEDA’s values per 100g of millet, Kapoor noted that foxtail millet with 12.3 grams of protein trumps all others like Bajra with 10.9 grams, little millet with 10.1 grams, jowar with 9.9 grams, proso millet with 8.3 grams, kodo millet with 8 grams, ragi with 7.1 grams, and barnyard millet with 6.2 grams.
She cautioned that one should always eat millet with dal or legumes. “This will help to provide a more complete and good quality protein profile,” said Kapoor.Advertisement
We turned toward our in-house nutrition experts to help us make informed choices when it comes to millet and protein needs.
Protein is a component of food that is very important in the repair and maintenance of the body’s tissues. “While choosing a protein for our diet we always choose eggs, meat, beans, dairy, etc, and forget grains as protein-rich,” said dietitian Simrat Bhui.
All grains including millet contain 8-20 per cent of protein with a significant amount of carbohydrates and fatty acids. “According to studies, foxtail millet contains 12.3 per cent of protein which makes this millet highest in containing proteins,” Bhui added.

"Should you say no to cooking with sunflower, canola, and vegetable oils?","Considering the attention to one’s health and lifestyle, one of the most asked questions is which oil should be used for cooking. To simplify it, dietitian Lavleen Kaur said that one should keep trying to moderate their oils such that different foods should be cooked using different sources of fat.
For roti, go for desi ghee. Apply ghee on parathas. “Indian tadka in daals/veggies? Opt for mustard, sesame, or peanut oil (cold-pressed ‘kachhi ghani’ style),” said Kaur.
– For sautéing/steaming vegetables or salad dressing, olive oil is your friend. “Outside India? Avocado or grapeseed oil works great (but not for Indian tadka). Mix it up for omega-3 and omega-6 balance,” said Kaur.Advertisement
The dietitian advised against using refined oils like canola, sunflower, safflower, vegetable, and palm oil.
“Stick to these tips for 3 months, and watch your health transform!” said Kaur.
Replacing saturated and trans fats with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats is good for your heart, said Dr Munna Das, consultant, interventional cardiologist and electrophysiologist, Narayana Hospital, Howrah.
“Non-tropical vegetable oils may be chosen to prepare your food which is a good option. Avoiding palm and coconut oil is very important as they contain more solid fats. A few more examples of solid fats are butter, lard, margarine, and tropic oils which should not be used too frequently for cooking,” said Dr Das.Advertisement
However, Dr Dilip Gude, senior consultant physician, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad said that all kinds of oils have some good characteristics and some bad in them. “No one oil is superior to others. It is always better to rotate and switch and use different kinds of oils in moderation,” said Dr Gude.
According to Dr Gude, safflower oil has less saturated fats and hence can be considered for cooking. “When used in moderation safflower oils are known to help in controlling blood sugars, cholesterol, and skin inflammatory conditions,” said Dr Gude.

Soya bean, canola oil, and, grape seed, sesame, and corn oil are essentially less healthy. “For sauteing, and baking, avocado, and olive oil seem healthier alternatives. The benefits of olive oil however are lost when it’s very heated. Hence it’s always better to use for sauteing or sprinkling after the curry is done,” said Dr Gude.
Free radicals develop when any oil is heated to extreme especially as in frying. “Reheated and reused oils especially produce trans-fats which are dangerous and are known to accelerate atherosclerosis and are bad for the heart,” said Dr Gude.Advertisement
Dr Gude mentioned that sunflower oil has high vitamin E and omega 3 fatty acids but like most oils, if used in excess it can result in inflammation and accelerated atherosclerosis. “Butter on the other hand is nutritious and has many nutrients like vitamins A, E, and K and helps ease inflammation through its supply of important fatty acids. But again moderation is the key,” said Dr Gude.

Dr Das also advised that one can choose extra virgin olive oil which stands out as a top choice for cooking. “It contains monounsaturated fats, which can help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels while maintaining HDL (good) cholesterol. Additionally, its high levels of antioxidants provide further benefits. Another excellent option is avocado oil, rich in monounsaturated fats and low in saturated fats. Its high smoke point makes it suitable for cooking at higher temperatures without oxidising and producing harmful compounds,” said Dr Das.

*If your oil starts to smoke or catch fire, it should be avoided as it starts to degrade once it reaches its smoke point.

Four studios that brought craft to India Design ID 2024,"For 31-year-old Aku Zeliang, this was a story waiting to be told – of the Konyaks, one of the last headhunter tribes of east Nagaland, often recognised by their tattooed faces and elaborate headgear. At the recently concluded India Design ID 2024 in Delhi, the Dimapur-based designer brought the skills of his family craft to his cane and bamboo furniture. “One of the collections is inspired by the Konyak dances where people are dressed in black and wear colourful jewellery. With an ancient civilisation that had no script, it was the tattoos that became a way of communication. These are the motifs you see on our tables and chairs. We have also reimagined the tiger spirit tattoo, usually seen on Naga warriors, through dyed cane strips in the collection,” he said.

What happens to your body if you have more than 3 cups of chai/coffee every day?,"Chai and coffee – the aromatic, invigorating beverages that fuel our mornings and perk us up throughout the day. But while a moderate cup (or two) can be beneficial, exceeding the recommended daily intake can have some unwelcome consequences on your body. Let’s delve into the science behind what happens when you go overboard with your chai or coffee fix.
The Jitters and Beyond: The Physiological Effects
Caffeine, the star ingredient in both chai and coffee, is a central nervous system stimulant. While it initially boosts energy and alertness, excessive intake can lead to:
Anxiety and nervousness: That wired feeling, the racing heart, and the restless energy – these are all signs of an overstimulated nervous system. Caffeine triggers the release of cortisol, the stress hormone, which can amplify anxiety and make you feel on edge.Advertisement
Sleep disturbances: Coffee and chai can interfere with your sleep-wake cycle, making it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. This can lead to daytime fatigue, irritability, and decreased concentration.
Headaches and migraines: Chronic caffeine headaches are a common complaint among over-consumers. The sudden withdrawal of caffeine after regular intake can also trigger migraines in some individuals.
Digestive issues: Caffeine can irritate the stomach lining, leading to heartburn, acid reflux, and even diarrhea.
High blood pressure and heart palpitations: In some individuals, excessive caffeine intake can lead to a temporary increase in blood pressure and heart rate.Advertisement
Beyond the Physical: The Mental and Emotional Impact
Over-reliance on caffeine can also have a negative impact on your mental and emotional well-being:
Addiction and dependence: Caffeine is known to be mildly addictive, and regular overconsumption can lead to dependence. You might experience withdrawal symptoms like headaches, fatigue, and irritability when you try to cut back.
Decreased stress resilience: While a cup of coffee might seem like a temporary escape from stress, chronic caffeine use can actually decrease your body’s ability to handle stress in the long run.
Impaired emotional regulation: Overconsumption can worsen emotional reactivity, making you more prone to anger, frustration, and agitation.
Finding the Sweet Spot: Moderation is KeyAdvertisement
The good news is, you don’t have to swear off your beloved chai or coffee entirely. The key is moderation. The recommended daily intake of caffeine for adults is 400mg, roughly equivalent to 4 cups of brewed coffee. However, individual sensitivity varies, and some people may experience negative effects even at lower doses.
Here are some tips for practicing moderation
Track your intake: Keep a log of how much chai or coffee you consume each day. This can help you become more aware of your habits and identify areas for adjustment.
Switch to decaf: Opt for decaffeinated options or gradually reduce the amount of caffeine in your regular brew.
Explore alternatives: Consider natural energy boosters like green tea, matcha, or guarana.Advertisement
Focus on hydration: Drinking plenty of water throughout the day can help counter the dehydrating effects of caffeine.
Prioritize sleep: Getting enough sleep is essential for managing stress and improving your body’s response to caffeine.
Remember, the goal is to enjoy your chai or coffee without them controlling you. By listening to your body and practicing moderation, you can reap the benefits of these beverages without compromising your health and well-being.
So, the next time you reach for that extra cup, take a moment to pause and consider your body’s needs. Choose mindful indulgence over mindless consumption, and savor the invigorating aroma and flavor of your chai or coffee knowing you’re striking the perfect balance.",lifestyle
"For a Ukrainian gardener, flowers offer a way forward","Written by Margaret Roach
The Clematis that delight Alla Olkhovska the most among the 120 or so types she grows are not the familiar, large-flowered hybrids, as extravagantly beautiful as they are. It’s the small, less frequently grown species — the ones whose common names often include the phrase “leather flower,” many of them native to the Southeastern United States — that have stolen her heart.
Their scaled-down charm makes them ethereal subjects for photography, another passion of Olkhovska’s. But what really impresses her is how well the tiny, bell-shaped blooms with thick petals stand up to the increasingly hot, dry summers her garden is experiencing.Advertisement
The whiteleaf leather flower (C. glaucophylla) and scarlet leather flower (C. texensis), for example, can really take the heat and just keep blooming and blooming, adapting to challenging environmental circumstances.
Two years ago this month, a more sudden call to adapt was sounded — this one to the gardener herself, along with her fellow Ukrainian citizens. In Kharkiv, where she lives, and around the nation, war had arrived.
Olkhovska, now 38, had been building up her plant collection in preparation for starting a small rare-plants nursery. But with war came a new assignment: to find a way, in the face of it, to support her family.
There were already challenges. Olkhovska’s mother-in-law and grandmother rely on her as a caregiver. And her husband, Vitalii Olkhovskyi, who suffered lung and heart damage from a severe COVID-19 infection, was early in his ongoing rehabilitation when war broke out.Advertisement
 To support her family during wartime, Alla Olkhovska, began selling more seeds online, hoping to expand her foreign customer base. She collects and processes each seed by hand, packing them into envelopes for sale. (Alla Olkhovska via The New York Times)
The family was rooted in place, unable to afford relocating, as they watched so many neighbors do, following round after round of missile and drone attacks that ravaged the city and its infrastructure.
With Ukrainians “not knowing what will happen next, and a very, very big decline in the standard of living,” Olkhovska said, she knew that starting a local nursery was no longer feasible; any customers would have to come from elsewhere.
Shopping for plants, she added, is just not front of mind “when you’re afraid, and you don’t know what will happen with the territory — whether you’ll be able to stay there, or if you will survive the winter.”
Nevertheless, it was her garden, and especially her Clematis, that provided, showing her the way forward.
Cultivating Customers for Her SeedsAdvertisement
Olkhovska began by doing the only thing she could think of: selling more seeds online.
The internet, after all, was where she had started learning about plants when she got her first computer at 20. Then, as now, hobbyists and experts would gather on foreign forums and, later, social media to swap horticultural knowledge and seeds. Perhaps, she thought, some of those connections might help her expand her small customer base.
“Selling seeds — it was like my last resort, my last attempt,” she said. And she was far from confident that her plan would work.
As it turned out, however, Olkhovska’s taste in plants, honed on those foreign forums, had made the seeds from her Clematis collection especially marketable. Different sells.Advertisement
“I like everything unusual, everything rare, everything difficult and challenging to grow,” she said, although difficult and challenging have been taken to an extreme these last two years, through no fault of the plants.
 When war came to her country, Olkhovska had been planning to open a rare-plants nursery. Now her Clematis seeds have an international following. (Vitalii Olkhovskyi via The New York Times)
Her affection for species plants over hybrids has helped, too, because many nonhybrid types can be grown more reliably from seed than the offspring of the large-flowered hybrids, which don’t resemble the parent plant.
As she accelerated her efforts, more foreign orders arrived, including one last spring from Erin Benzakein of Floret, a flower farm and seed company in the Skagit Valley of northwestern Washington.
Clematis vines make distinctive filler for flower arrangements, and Benzakein was searching the web for unusual varieties to expand the farm’s selection. She had read about Olkhovska’s seed list and wanted to see for herself.Advertisement
It was the photographs that pulled Benzakein in. With more than 1 million Instagram followers and multiple books to her credit, including a New York Times bestseller, she has a highly cultivated eye not just for flowers but for effective media.
“I was stopped like, ‘Wait, what’s going on here? These are too beautiful. How have I not seen this before?’” Benzakein recalled. “I was surprised by the varieties that she was featuring, and then the way that she showed them in the photos just completely stopped me in my tracks.”
Into her shopping cart went seeds and more seeds. Soon messages started going back and forth between the two women.
A Documentary of a Wartime Garden
An idea germinated. Could Benzakein interview Olkhovska for Floret’s popular website? And then another plan quickly sprouted: a documentary for the company’s YouTube channel.Advertisement
The 33-minute “Gardening in a War Zone” debuted in December, with Rob Finch, who leads Floret’s video-based storytelling efforts, as the director and producer. The film combines footage shot by Oleh Halaidych, a local videographer; Olkhovska’s husband; and Olkhovska.
Like her day-to-day life, it is a work of chiaroscuro, a portrait of extremes: roses and guns.
We see her at the kitchen table in her hooded fleece robe, working by candlelight, during yet another power outage. To a soundtrack of air-raid sirens, she is counting seeds to pack into little envelopes for shipping.
One by one, each precious seed is harvested from the garden surrounding her grandmother’s home, which Olkhovska travels to regularly from the apartment 30 minutes away where she lives with her husband.Advertisement
It’s not the first time that the plot at Granny’s has come to the family’s rescue. The house once belonged to Olkhovska’s great-grandfather, who planted an orchard in post-World War II Soviet times, hoping to provide income and food.

A spontaneous moment struck Finch most of all in the documentary, as he watched footage of Olkhovska filming herself cutting flowers to bring home.
“It’s very important for me to have some fresh flowers, and I do it despite everything,” she says as she scouts for blooms. “Even when it’s really hard, because it helps — it helps to cope with the problems.”
If there was ever any doubt about the power of the natural world, this was irrefutable proof.Advertisement
“Does beauty still really matter if you’re trying to find food or shelter, or have heat or electricity, or avoid missile attacks or drone attacks?” Finch said. “Yes, it still matters.”
Writing About Flowers, Not War
Like any gardener in a cold, dark winter, Olkhovska dreams of gentler times ahead — of new flower beds she will make, and of “my biggest dream, making my own nursery.”
But unlike the equinox, the end of the war isn’t preprinted on any calendar. There is no date.
“But let’s hope tomorrow will be a better day for us all!” she wrote in a recent Instagram story. “I want to write about flowers, not war.”
The plants, she said, motivate her “to work — and to stay alive.”",lifestyle
Make a high-protein no bread sandwich like chef Shipra Khanna,"After sharing how she likes to kickstart her mornings, chef Shipra Khanna is back with a delicious, quick, and easy recipe for a filling sandwich with a twist. The MasterChef shared a high-protein sandwich without bread recipe for her followers and fans that she likes to have after her morning gym sessions. “High-protein sandwich with no bread is my favourite breakfast after the gym. Here’s the recipe for #healthunlimited,” shared Khanna.
How to make it?
Ingredients
1 cup moong dal (yellow lentils) soaked overnight
Salt to taste
1 no – Green chilli
Few fresh coriander leaves
2tbsp – Olive oil
For the filling
Mixed vegetables, finely chopped
1/2cup – Corn
Green, red and yellow peppers
1 no – Small onion
MethodAdvertisement
*Grind lentils, ginger, coriander, and chillies in a blender until smooth.
*Now take a gas toaster. Grease both sides with oil and spread a 1” layer of this mixture evenly.
*Now add some chopped vegetables on top.
*And cover with another layer of the lentil mix.
*Now toast on both sides.

“Note: Don’t make a thick layer of the lentil mixture,” said Khanna.
Sushma PS, chief dietician, Jindal Naturecure Institute called this protein moong dal sandwich with no bread not only a unique and creative alternative to traditional sandwiches but also something that offers several nutritional benefits.
“The moong dal (yellow lentils) used in the recipe is an excellent source of plant-based protein. Lentils are known for their high protein content, making this sandwich a suitable option for individuals looking to increase their protein intake,” said Sushma.Advertisement

Including mixed vegetables such as corn, peppers, and onions adds a variety of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants to the dish. This makes the sandwich not only high in protein but also a good source of essential nutrients. “Since there is no bread in this recipe, it can be a suitable option for those looking to reduce their carbohydrate intake or following a low-carb diet,” said Sushma.
According to Sushma, olive oil provides healthy monounsaturated fats, which are beneficial for heart health. “You have control over the amount of salt added, allowing you to customise the recipe to your taste preferences and dietary needs,” said Sushma.

The Earth laughs in flowers: tulips sparkle at the annual Delhi Tulip Festival,"Dotted with giant Ashoka trees right outside the Embassy of the Republic of Serbia in Shantipath, or what is colloquially called the “embassy area” in Delhi’s Chanakyapuri, is an array of neatly arranged banners and manicured, elegant rows of colourful tulips that welcome bystanders, visitors, and tourists.
The time of Basant Panchmi, which celebrates the onset of spring with colourful flowers, is an apt backdrop for this annual Delhi Tulip Festival — a unique initiative that celebrates Indo-Dutch maitri or friendship.
Several roundabouts and parks in the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) area greet you with these vibrant and happy tulips. As one walks past these beds of colours, mesmerising scenes from the movie Silsila (1981) come to mind. Two popular melodies, Dekha ek khwab and Yeh kahan aa gaye hum, were shot amid tulips in the famous Keukenhof gardens in the Netherlands back in the day.Advertisement
For the last four years, the roundabouts in Delhi’s Chanakyapuri have lit up in these effervescent tulips in many colours as the NDMC has been organising the Delhi Tulip Festival across a 1.5 km stretch of Shanti Path. The festival’s second edition this year is being held from February 10 to 21. 
‘A satiated bliss’

A kind of public good, it is an initiative centred around promoting environmental consciousness, creating awareness about the history, natural heritage, green capital, and floriculture among the citizens while providing people with a means of recreation with nature.
“Flowers attract people towards them. Whoever comes here, goes away with a satiated bliss,” says Sachin Vashisht, 39, a gardener watering the roundabout at Teen Murti Marg. 
Next to him are the orangish-red tulip flowers and another circle of sparkling orange and yellow tulips. The pink and purple tulips are a highlight here, with many photographers, couples, and people attempting to take selfies and trying to capture nature’s quiet calm amid racing vehicles. Then there are the pure yellow and red ones that glow even more as the sun makes them shimmer in the otherwise fading melancholy of the Delhi winter.Advertisement
The light pink ones are still nascent and will bloom in a few days. Another variety, a deep orangish yellow, has become mature and is blooming abundantly, with larger and rounder leaves compared to others. The red and white tulips are a scintillating sight to behold, too.
Around seven varieties of tulips – red, orange, yellow, white, black, purple, and white – have been planted in phases in neatly manicured roundabouts, public parks, and gardens in and around Shanti Path. Around 200,000 bulbs of tulips brought from the Netherlands were planted at the end of December last year at various locations in and around Chanakya Puri with the help of dedicated and meticulous gardeners under the guidance of the horticulture department.
“Last year, we put black-red tulips right here; people loved them,” says Vashisht.
Natural recreation

At the Shantipath lawns, recreation has a new meaning. Against the lovely educative banners mapping out “the history of tulips” to “Indo-dutch” diplomacy, families, children, and youngsters experiment with their cameras. Someone quietly reads a book, while many others snack on something they have got from home in the bright sunlight.Advertisement
Vendors selling bhelpuri, chai, ram laddoo with chutney, ice creams, and cola – are ready to lure visitors, especially as the weather warms to encourage people to be out and about.
Asmita, a marketing professional from Gurgaon, is silently capturing the beauty of a redish-white tulip. “I had previously seen tulips on my official visit to Berlin once. After seeing several reels on Instagram, I came here because I love nature. These tulips bring a sense of calm and tranquillity to the eyes, with everyone, even kids, enjoying. Such steps are good for the ecosystem of cities,” she says.
At the Mandi House roundabout, professionals generally enjoy the calming essence of these flowers, with many others taking a quick nap. Students from the nearby National School of Drama do their rehearsals. The roundabouts imitate round tulip rangolis as people embrace the lovely hues of the spring season organised so elegantly by the authorities, keeping the objectives of environmental diplomacy and sustainability in mind.
Nature and nurture

Raju, 43, a gardener working at Shantipath lawns since 2007, says, “These tulips are a result of the sustained efforts of NDMC and the adhikaaris (officials) working on this project. We have planted the tulip bulbs around 2-2.5 inches under the ground”.Advertisement
Explaining the anatomy of the tulip bulb, he says, “The bulbs resemble those of the onion plant. We plant them in vertical flower beds in horizontal rows. The training for this has been provided to us by NDMC. They have also given us books with the entire map of the area based on which we plant these”.
Gardeners have grown these tulips following patterns of intercropping. At Shantipath, the tulips are neatly grown in rows intercropped with petunias and pansies. “These tulips will last only 15 days, after which the intercropped petunias, pansies, and other flowers will blossom,” says Raju.
This intercropping ensures that the parks and roundabouts are often adorned with flowers. Next to the rows of these tulips are also beds of Salvia Splendons, which are just beginning to bloom. At the Mandi House roundabout, yellow and red tulips have been precisely intercropped with white, pink, and maroon dianthus flowers. 
The blooms here are a testament to the deep care and nurture these “hitherto” exotic varieties of flowers need. Keeping the life cycle of flowers in mind, the bulbs have been planted in phases with late-blooming and early-blooming tulips. If the sun is sparing, the tulips will last a month or so. Immense care is needed for them to thrive – regular watering and insect protection.Advertisement
“These tulips need a lot of hard work and dedication. They are expensive flowers, and there have been incidents of theft once or twice. The security personnel guard these lovely flowers,” says Vashisht. 
He adds, “We work so hard, the authorities should also consider rewarding us with some award or memento.”
Flower advocacy, environmental consciousness

Many activities like tulip walks, educational and informative discussions around these flowers, photo competitions, and music festivals have been organised. After the Tulip Festival is over, a floral-food festival serving culinary delights and recipes made of flowers will be a significant attraction in addition to a rose festival. Students are seen clicking selfies with the flowers. The parks and walkways have also become a hangout for people to unwind and host small picnics. Some marathoners enjoy practicing here.
Activities like tulip walks and exposure visits provide students with immense knowledge about cultural diplomacy, sustainability, and environmental cooperation. To motivate enthusiasts, nature lovers, photographers, and students, the NDMC also posts a “picture of the day” chosen by judges on social media platforms and banners at Shantipath, encouraging community participation, green infrastructure, flower-based tourism.Advertisement
Way forward

One can draw inspiration from the famous Tulip Garden in Srinagar and have a similar initiative in Delhi (considering the constraints of temperatures) to create more flower-based, natural-heritage tourism opportunities.
These efforts are under the aegis of the larger objectives of making Delhi “a city of flowers” and promoting flower and nature-based tourism in the city known for its natural and green heritage with ancestral trees and monuments. Festivals such as these provide much-needed recreational opportunities amid nature and also contribute to the objectives of “smart cities”.

Additionally, for enthusiasts, flower workshops using bouquet arrangements and awareness workshops for florists could also be undertaken with the help of experts.",lifestyle
"Deepika Padukone to Margot Robbie, best-dressed celebs from BAFTA 2024","The BAFTAs, known as the British film industry’s equivalent of the Oscars, showcased the best of red-carpet fashion on Sunday, with many Hollywood A-listers flaunting their sartorial glamour.

Meanwhile, Emma Stone, winner of the Leading Actress category for her role in Poor Things, looked stunning in a peach one-shouldered gown from Louis Vuitton, reminiscent of her character’s costuming in the film. Her coral makeup, diamond necklace, and tousled hairdo rounded it off.
Nominated for the Supporting Actress category for Oppenheimer, Emily Blunt bedazzled in her elaborate Elie Saab gown. Her statement jewellery added to the charm.

"Are camphor, coconut oil effective against dandruff? Experts weigh in","Dealing with dandruff can be pretty annoying, right? But guess what – there’s a natural mix that might help: camphor and coconut oil, according to blogger Deepti Kapoor. Let’s break it down for you, with help from dermatologists.
The blogger shared that a mix of pure powdered camphor (kapur) and coconut oil applied half an hour before shampoo can be effective against dandruff.
What is dandruff?
Dandruff is a skin condition brought on by an excessive amount of oil and a naturally occurring fungus. Dr Rinky Kapoor, consultant dermatologist, cosmetic dermatologist and dermato-surgeon, The Esthetic Clinics said that it causes irritation and is visible in the form of tiny white flakes.Advertisement
Dr Mittal pointed out that there are sebaceous glands all over your scalp that secrete oil. “The largest organ in the body, your skin, depends on this for their correct functioning. However, it’s a warning indication if your skin starts to get oily for whatever reason. Because this activates the fungus Malassezia Globosa, which feeds on this oil and grows,” explained Dr Mittal.
“You must address the underlying causes of dandruff if you wish to use camphor for it,” said Dr Jatin Mittal, co-founder, cosmetologist, and skin expert from Abhivrit Aesthetics, New Delhi.
Does the combination of camphor and coconut oil work?
Camphor has cooling properties. “It’s like a superhero that fights inflammation and germs. For dandruff, it can help soothe your scalp and keep those nasty fungus guys in check,” said Dr Rinky.
Dr Mittal too shared that due to camphor’s anti-fungal properties, using it for dandruff may make sense. “It may mitigate the fungus growth that causes dandruff while lowering irritation and swelling. Additionally, as your blood circulation increases, nutrients may be sent to your scalp, aiding in the process overall. For this reason, some people decide to utilise camphor as a dandruff removal method,” said Dr Mittal.Advertisement

You’ve probably heard about coconut oil doing wonders for hair. Well, it’s true! “Coconut oil is like a good moisturiser that can reach deep into your hair. It also fights germs, and helps with dry scalps but remember not to apply for long hours if you have dandruff,” said Dr Rinky.
However, Dr Mittal noted that the effectiveness of coconut oil and camphor mix for dandruff is still inconclusive. “If you have dandruff and severely dry skin, this might be the best option for you. People with seborrhoeic dermatitis may become much more irritated when oils are applied to their scalp,” said Dr Mittal.

Before you go all-in, it’s smart to test this mixture on a small spot, just to make sure your skin is adaptive to it. “While this camphor and coconut oil mix could be your secret weapon against dandruff, everyone’s hair is different,” said Dr Rinky.

Experts urge that before starting treatment, explore the underlying cause of your dandruff with your doctor. “You’ll be able to choose the appropriate things, like coconut oil, in this way. If, despite using it multiple times, you still don’t observe any improvements, you should also visit your dermatologist,” said Dr Mittal.",lifestyle
‘It is hijacking my brain’ – a team of experts found ways to help young people addicted to social media to cut the craving,"Many people have compared the addictive nature of social media to cigarettes. Checking your likes, they say, is the new smoke break. Others say the unease over social media is just the next round of moral panic about new technologies.
We are a pair of researchers who investigate how social media affects the mental health of young people. More than 75% of teens check their phone hourly, and half say they feel like they’re addicted to their devices.
Here are some of the things they’ve told us: “TikTok has me in a chokehold.” “I would 1,000% say I am addicted.”Advertisement
“I feel completely aware that it is hijacking my brain, but I can’t put it down. This leaves me feeling ashamed.” Maybe you’ve had similar feelings yourself, no matter your age. Although it’s true social technologies offer clear benefits – unlike smoking – many people still feel uncomfortable with how much time they spend online and often wonder if they’re addicted.
Years of investigation have led our team to this conclusion: Perhaps a better approach is to view your media consumption as a diet. Just as there are many ways to have a healthy diet, there are also a variety of ways to develop healthy and personalized social media habits.
The search for answers
A deluge of research on social media usage that began in the early 2010s shows negative impacts in areas related to body image, eating disorders and social comparison.
Conversely, other studies point to the mental health benefits of social media, including social well-being, strong friendships and exposure to diverse perspectives.Advertisement
Still other studies show conflicting results. In fact, inconclusive or mixed results seem to be a recurring pattern when researching this subject.
The inconsistencies in these studies highlight the very hard problem of characterizing healthy interaction between two complex systems – social media technologies and human behavioral psychology.
One issue is that the stress, anxiety and challenges to self-esteem experienced by users may vary from moment to moment, depending on what they are viewing. Consider that not all time spent on social media is equal. For example, messaging distant friends for one hour a day will likely leave you feeling more fulfilled than spending 30 minutes a day doomscrolling, which refers to an excessive amount of time consuming negative media.
That’s why researchers are trying to distinguish between the active and passive use of social media. “Active use” refers to social exchanges, like sending messages or posting content, while “passive use” is strictly the consumption of social media content without participation, contribution or engagement with others.Advertisement
But even this distinction is too simplistic and has come under scrutiny. Some active behaviours, such as trolling on Reddit, are likely unhealthy for everyone involved. And some passive behaviours, like consuming educational videos, are beneficial.
Because healthy media consumption varies considerably from person to person, our research takes a different approach and focuses on users developing personal agency with respect to their media consumption.
A four-week intervention
 Just as there are many ways to have a healthy diet, there are also a variety of ways to develop healthy and personalized social media habits. (Source: Freepik)
More than 500 college students with a wide range of social media habits have participated in our ongoing study. The students begin by reflecting on their current relationship with social media and then set goals for the changes they want to make. This might include spending less time mindlessly scrolling, curating their feed on an app or not sleeping with the phone in the bedroom.
For four weeks, participants report their success in adhering to their goals. They also reflect on their feelings and experiences through journaling and completing standard psychological surveys that capture social media addiction and other mental health outcomes.Advertisement
Our initial analysis indicates that the four-week intervention significantly reduces social media addiction for those who started with problematic or clinical levels of social media addiction.
Problematic social media addiction is associated with a host of negative effects including moodiness, anxiety and an excessive amount of time and energy spent on or thinking about social media. People with clinical social media addiction levels experience those same effects but to a great degree, with their habit patterns around social media resembling that of an addict.
Those with problematic social media addiction scores at the start of the intervention showed a mean reduction of 26%, and scores for participants who began with clinical social media addiction scores fell by 35%. These reductions brought both groups into a healthy range of social media use by the conclusion of the intervention.
At the end of the four weeks, participants reported positive changes in their relationships with social media with statements like the following: “I feel as though my connections have strengthened with my friends because when I now communicate with them, it is to have an actual conversation, rather than to pass the time responding to Snapchats.” “I find (social media) a lot less appealing in a lot of ways and haven’t really felt the urge to post something in a long time. I think I am … using it for fun or connectedness instead of distraction.” “This challenge has positively changed how I view social media, and social approval.” Positive change takes timeAdvertisement
Much like any behaviour change, adopting healthier media consumption habits requires time, dedication and self-reflection. While our research focuses on college students, we believe a similar four-week process focused on agency and reflection can lead to profound improvements in overall well-being for people of all ages.
That said, there are practical steps you can take right now to reduce your dependence on social media. This includes turning off notifications, removing or limiting apps that you find harmful, curating your social media feed by unfollowing certain accounts, setting your phone to grayscale to reduce the appeal, and reserving phone-free time. You can get started right now by taking a free, psychologically validated survey to assess your level of addiction.

These superfoods must be soaked before eating them to maximise their health benefits,"For many, superfoods conjure images of exotic berries and expensive powders. But the truth is, some of the most potent and readily available superfoods might already be hiding in your pantry – nuts, seeds, grains, and legumes. However, there’s a secret to maximising their health benefits: soaking.
Dr K. Somnath Gupta, senior consultant physician and diabetology at Yashoda Hospitals Hyderabad, explained why: “Certain foods contain complex compounds like phytic acid and enzyme inhibitors. These can hinder the absorption of essential nutrients by our bodies. Soaking helps break down these compounds, making the nutrients more bioavailable.”
The advantages go beyond increased nutrient absorption. Soaking can also:Advertisement
Reduce bloating and discomfort: By neutralising antinutrients like lectins, which can irritate the digestive system, soaking can ease digestion and make these foods more tolerable.
Improve palatability: Some superfoods, like nuts and seeds, can be hard and gritty. Soaking softens their texture, making them more enjoyable to eat.
Reduce cooking time: Pre-soaked legumes and grains cook significantly faster, saving you time in the kitchen.
Superfoods to Supercharge with Soaking
Quinoa: Soaking removes the bitter coating, enhances digestibility, and cuts cooking time.Advertisement
Chia Seeds: They swell into a gel-like consistency, adding texture and boosting nutrient absorption in smoothies and puddings.
 Vitamin E in almonds protects the skin from oxidative stress and helps maintain hydration.
Almonds: Soaking neutralises enzyme inhibitors and phytic acid, unlocking valuable minerals like magnesium and calcium.
Oats: Overnight soaking breaks down starches and reduces phytic acid, resulting in a creamier texture and improved digestion.
Lentils: Soaking reduces cooking time, eases digestion by breaking down complex sugars, and diminishes antinutrients like phytic acid.Advertisement
Dr Dilip Gude, another senior consultant physician at Yashoda Hospitals, reiterates the benefits: “Soaking essentially dissolves tannins and phytates, improving the absorption of iron, zinc, calcium, and protein. It also boosts the breakdown of enzyme inhibitors, further enhancing nutrient uptake.”
Soaking Tips:

Most nuts and seeds benefit from a 6-8 hour soak. For legumes, 8-12 hours is optimal.
Use filtered water and consider adding a pinch of salt to enhance flavour.
Drain and rinse well before consuming or cooking.

Remember, soaking isn’t mandatory for everyone. However, if you’re looking to maximise the health potential of these superfoods, it’s a simple yet powerful step you can take.",lifestyle
These tips are what you need to increase mobility and your lifespan,"Staying mobile isn’t just about getting around easily; it’s a key ingredient in living a longer, healthier life.
As Dr Shishir Joshi, senior consultant – internal medicine at Sahyadri Hospitals, Pune pointed out, “Maintaining mobility not only enhances our quality of life but also plays a significant role in extending lifespan.” Luckily, proactive steps can be taken to keep you moving freely and enjoying life to the fullest.
Unlock your mobility and longevity potential with these essential tips, according to Dr Joshi.Advertisement
Embrace Regular Exercise
Engaging in regular physical activity is one of the most effective ways to boost mobility and promote longevity. Incorporate a combination of aerobic exercises, strength training, and flexibility exercises into your routine.
Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity workouts weekly, said Dr Joshi. “Include strength training and flexibility exercises for muscle mass, bone density, and joint health.”
Stretch & Balance
Activities like yoga and Pilates improve flexibility, balance, and stability, reducing the risk of falls and keeping you moving confidently.
Manage Your Weight
Excess weight strains joints and limits mobility. Focus on a balanced diet and regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight for optimal mobility.Advertisement
Nourish Your Joints

Incorporate joint-friendly exercises like swimming and cycling. Consume omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, and glucosamine to support joint health. Seek professional guidance for joint pain or stiffness.
Stand Tall
Good posture prevents musculoskeletal issues and improves balance. Be mindful of your posture while sitting, standing, and moving to avoid slouching and strain.
Hydrate for Health
Water lubricates joints, regulates body temperature, and supports cellular function. Aim for adequate water intake throughout the day, especially before, during, and after exercise.
Prioritise Sleep
Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep nightly to support body recovery and repair processes. Chronic sleep deprivation can negatively impact mobility, cognitive function, and immune response.Advertisement
By incorporating these tips into your daily routine, you can unlock a future filled with mobility, vitality, and a longer, healthier life. Remember, consistency is key, so start small, find activities you enjoy, and gradually integrate them into your lifestyle.

What you can do if someone is experiencing a cardiac arrest in front of you,"Witnessing someone experiencing cardiac arrest can be a terrifying experience. However, knowing how to react promptly can significantly increase their chances of survival.
According to Dr Pranil Gangurde, interventional cardiologist, Adhikari Lifeline Multispecialty Hospital, Palghar, recognising a cardiac arrest requires swift observation and action, as immediate first-aid can be life-saving.
How to recognise signs of cardiac arrest?
Immediate Signs: Look for sudden collapse, absence of pulse and breathing, and loss of consciousness.Advertisement
Warning Signs: Be mindful of chest discomfort, shortness of breath, weakness, and irregular heartbeats, especially in individuals with risk factors.
Dr Rahul Patil, senior consultant cardiologist, Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune, said that though sometimes the aforementioned symptoms occur before a cardiac arrest, a sudden cardiac arrest often occurs with no warning. He also shared a real-life scenario in a mall where prompt bystander intervention, including CPR and AED use, saved a life.
 If you’re trained, perform CPR with 30 chest compressions at a rate of 100-120 per minute followed by 2 breaths. If not trained, focus on continuous chest compressions. (Representational Image)
“Portable automated external defibrillators, called AEDs, are available in many public places, including airports and shopping malls. You can also buy one for home use. AEDs come with step-by-step voice instructions for their use. They’re programmed to allow a shock only when appropriate,” said Dr Patil.
What should be the first-aid for cardiac arrest?

Call for emergency medical assistance immediately.
Ensure the person’s safety. Lay them flat on their back and open their airway.
Begin CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation): If you’re trained, perform CPR with 30 chest compressions at a rate of 100-120 per minute followed by 2 breaths. If not trained, focus on continuous chest compressions.
Utilise an AED (Automated External Defibrillator), if available. Follow the device’s instructions for safe and effective use.

Dr Gangurde and Patil shared some additional tips on what to do in such a situation:Advertisement

Check for external injuries and address any bleeding promptly.
Maintain a safe environment and communicate clearly with emergency services.
Even if you’re not CPR-trained, chest compressions at the right rate can be life-saving.

Knowing CPR is a valuable skill that can help save lives. Consider enrolling in basic life-saving skills courses to be better prepared.
People with risk factors for cardiac arrest should be aware of potential warning signs and consult a cardiologist if they experience any concerning symptoms.
Regularly check for AED availability in public places and familiarise yourself with their basic operation.
By staying informed and prepared, we can collectively create a safer environment and potentially save lives in the face of cardiac arrest emergencies.",lifestyle
Should you heat honey?,"In our quest to bring you verified information on what works and what doesn’t when it comes to our diet and lifestyle, we have yet another interesting take on whether honey turns poisonous when heated. Krish Ashok, the author of The Masala Lab, shared that heating honey is not poisonous or harmful unlike what is believed. “The Internet’s most overused argument by authority is “according to Ayurveda”, and the funny thing is – no one bothers to cite original sources and provide context for what it might have meant 2000 years ago. Modern-day honey is a more widely available product than honey would have been in ancient times. Raw, unfiltered, unpasteurised honey in today’s world is a risky product. Doctors regularly see small children suffer from terrible consequences as a result of botulism poisoning from raw honey,” said Krish.
According to him, buy pasteurised honey and use it any way you want. “If you are the risk-taking type that uses raw forest honey, then remember that heating is going to destroy all the micronutrients and enzymes you paid for. The enzymes and micronutrients in honey come from flowers. Those flowers later become fruits or vegetables. We cook vegetables. If that isn’t toxic, how is heated honey going to become toxic,” said Krish.
As such, we decided to turn toward our in-house experts to learn more about how to appropriately derive optimum benefits out of honey.Advertisement
Shruti K Bhardwaj, chief dietician, Zydus Hospitals, Ahmedabad said heating honey is a debated topic with considerations on both sides.

“While heating honey can make it easier to pour and mix with other ingredients, it can also degrade some of its beneficial enzymes, antioxidants, and nutrients, potentially reducing its nutritional value and unique flavour,” said Bhardwaj.

Raw honey, in its natural state, retains more of these properties. “However, heating honey slightly can also help in certain culinary applications like baking or making sauces. Ultimately, the decision to heat honey depends on personal preference and the intended use, but if you’re aiming to preserve its natural benefits, consuming it raw is the best option,” Bhardwaj said.",lifestyle

Confused if your situationship likes you? 5 signs they’re just not that into you,"Ever felt like you’re giving your all in a relationship, but their feelings remain a confusing enigma? You text, they take hours to reply. You make plans, they cancel last minute. Your heart whispers “They’re into you,” but your gut screams otherwise.
Koushani Sarkar, counselling psychologist and executive, Outreach and Content, MPower, said that navigating the intricate steps of human relationships can both exhilarate and challenge us as we try to decipher the subtle signals of mutual attraction.
But fear not, for we will guide you through the often murky waters of mixed signals. We’ll explore the 5 telltale signs that might indicate their feelings don’t align with yours, empowering you to make informed decisions about your emotional well-being.Advertisement
Reciprocal Engagement
In any successful relationship, mutual engagement is the cornerstone. When your partner actively seeks your presence, initiates meaningful conversations, and displays a genuine curiosity in your inner world, it signals a reciprocal emotional investment. This shared passion serves as a vital element in cultivating a deep and meaningful bond.
Nonverbal Synchrony
Be mindful of nonverbal cues while interacting with others. When gestures are mirrored, eye contact is maintained, and body language is synchronized, it is a sign that two people are in sync. When someone is genuinely interested in you, these nonverbal cues become more noticeable as they subconsciously mirror your actions and facial expressions.
 To sum up, truly grasping the signs that your feelings are reciprocated by someone else goes beyond simple observation – it involves delving into the intricacies of both their actions and emotions. (Source: Freepik)
Emotional Openness
Developing a strong emotional bond is vital in establishing a deep connection with someone. When your potential partner trusts you enough to open up about their vulnerabilities, personal experiences, and aspirations for the future, it demonstrates a level of comfort and openness. The exchange of this emotional intimacy is crucial – a mutually beneficial sharing creates a strong foundation of trust and understanding between the two of you.
Consistent Communication
Evaluating one’s level of interest in the digital era heavily relies on communication patterns. Regular and purposeful interactions, be it through written exchanges, phone conversations, or in-person dialogues, demonstrate a continued dedication to the bond. When your messages elicit prompt and considerate replies, it indicates a genuine appreciation for the relationship. Whether it’s a simple ‘good morning’ text or a lengthy evening conversation, the enthusiasm for communication is a hallmark of new love. If your new partner shows eagerness to share their day, thoughts, and experiences with you, it’s a clear sign that they value the connection and enjoy staying connected with you.Advertisement
Effort in Appearance
Putting effort into personal appearance can be a subconscious expression of interest. If your crush/partner takes the time to make special efforts to look good for you, it suggests a desire to make a positive impression and adds a touch of romance to the early stages of the relationship.",lifestyle
"Running or yoga can help beat depression, research shows – even if exercise is the last thing you feel like","At least one in ten people have depression at some point in their lives, with some estimates closer to one in four. It’s one of the worst things for someone’s wellbeing – worse than debt, divorce or diabetes.
One in seven Australians take antidepressants. Psychologists are in high demand. Still, only half of people with depression in high-income countries get treatment.
Our new research shows that exercise should be considered alongside therapy and antidepressants. It can be just as impactful in treating depression as therapy, but it matters what type of exercise you do and how you do it.Advertisement
Walk, run, lift, or dance away depression We found 218 randomised trials on exercise for depression, with 14,170 participants. We analysed them using a method called a network meta-analysis. This allowed us to see how different types of exercise compared, instead of lumping all types together.
We found walking, running, strength training, yoga and mixed aerobic exercise were about as effective as cognitive behaviour therapy – one of the gold-standard treatments for depression. The effects of dancing were also powerful. However, this came from analysing just five studies, mostly involving young women. Other exercise types had more evidence to back them.
Walking, running, strength training, yoga and mixed aerobic exercise seemed more effective than antidepressant medication alone, and were about as effective as exercise alongside antidepressants.
But of these exercises, people were most likely to stick with strength training and yoga.Advertisement
Antidepressants certainly help some people. And of course, anyone getting treatment for depression should talk to their doctor before changing what they are doing.
Still, our evidence shows that if you have depression, you should get a psychologist and an exercise plan, whether or not you’re taking antidepressants.
Join a programme and go hard (with support)
Before we analysed the data, we thought people with depression might need to “ease into it” with generic advice, such as “some physical activity is better than doing none.” But we found it was far better to have a clear programme that aimed to push you, at least a little. Programmes with clear structure worked better, compared with those that gave people lots of freedom. Exercising by yourself might also make it hard to set the bar at the right level, given low self-esteem is a symptom of depression.
We also found it didn’t matter how much people exercised, in terms of sessions or minutes a week. It also didn’t really matter how long the exercise program lasted. What mattered was the intensity of the exercise: the higher the intensity, the better the results.Advertisement
Yes, it’s hard to keep motivated

We should exercise caution in interpreting the findings. Unlike drug trials, participants in exercise trials know which “treatment” they’ve been randomised to receive, so this may skew the results.
Many people with depression have physical, psychological or social barriers to participating in formal exercise programs. And getting support to exercise isn’t free.
We also still don’t know the best way to stay motivated to exercise, which can be even harder if you have depression.
Our study tried to find out whether things like setting exercise goals helped, but we couldn’t get a clear result.Advertisement
Other reviews found it’s important to have a clear action plan (for example, putting exercise in your calendar) and to track your progress (for example, using an app or smartwatch). But predicting which of these interventions work is notoriously difficult.
A 2021 mega-study of more than 60,000 gym-goers found experts struggled to predict which strategies might get people into the gym more often. Even making workouts fun didn’t seem to motivate people. However, listening to audiobooks while exercising helped a lot, which no experts predicted.
Still, we can be confident that people benefit from personalised support and accountability. The support helps overcome the hurdles they’re sure to hit. The accountability keeps people going even when their brains are telling them to avoid it.
So, when starting out, it seems wise to avoid going it alone. Instead: — Join a fitness group or yoga studio.
— Get a trainer or an exercise physiologist.Advertisement
— Ask a friend or family member to go for a walk with you.
Taking a few steps towards getting that support makes it more likely you’ll keep exercising.
Let’s make this official
Some countries see exercise as a backup plan for treating depression. For example, the American Psychological Association only conditionally recommends exercise as a “complementary and alternative treatment” when “psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy is either ineffective or unacceptable”.
Based on our research, this recommendation is withholding a potent treatment from many people who need it.Advertisement
In contrast, The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists recommends vigorous aerobic activity at least two to three times a week for all people with depression.

Revitalise your skin naturally with this collagen-rich drink,"In the quest for radiant skin, collagen has emerged as a buzzword in the beauty and wellness industry. As the most abundant protein in the human body, collagen plays a crucial role in maintaining skin elasticity, hydration, and firmness. From skincare products to dietary supplements, collagen has become a sought-after ingredient promising to rejuvenate and revitalise aging skin. But what if we told you can increase your collagen production naturally without resorting to artificial means? Recently, nutritionist Leema Mahajan took to Instagram to share a collagen-rich drink that will boost your skin health.
Mahajan suggested making a bowl of bone broth by “simmering animal (chicken/mutton/beans/fish) bones in water and a small amount of vinegar (to help dissolve the bone and release collagen and minerals)” for around 4 to 24 hours.
According to the nutritionist, this protein and mineral-rich drink not only works on improving skin elasticity but also strengthens hair, improves gut health, repairs joints, and enhances the skin’s appearance as well. She advises drinking this at least two times a week to achieve the best results.Advertisement
Agreeing, Ruchika Jain, chief clinical nutritionist, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, told indianexpress.com that “when you simmer bones, ligaments, tendons, and other connective tissues in water for an extended period of time, collagen is released into the broth.” “This collagen-rich broth, commonly known as bone broth, can offer benefits such as joint health, skin elasticity, and overall connective tissues health,” she added.
However, Jain noted that the amount of collagen and its specific benefits may vary depending on factors such as the sources of the bones, the cooking time, and the overall quality of the broth.

It comprised:
100 imaginary skips
30 jumping jacks
3 sets of push ups
3 sets of squats
2 sets of dead hang
Plank till failure
1-minute deep breathing
Experts hail moving regularly, especially if you are someone who spends most of their time sitting and working. Multiple short packets of 5-10-minute exercises that you can do anytime and anywhere are called micro workouts, said Saurabh Bothra, CEO, Habuild in an earlier interaction.Advertisement
These focused, intense exercises, comprise mostly High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) exercises. These do not need any equipment at all.
“The exercises given in the post are super effective for better heart health, to build strength, build discipline, establish consistency, feel strong and positive. However, for these workouts to work on lean muscle building and weight loss, one needs to eat right as well,” said Sonia Bakshi, nutritionist and founder, DtF.
An example of a micro workout can be 10 squats and 10 push-ups, done over a 5-minute EMOM (every minute on the minute), this essentially makes it 50 squats and 50 pushups in 5 minutes and if done twice a day, it’s a decent amount of work, said Rishabh Telang, fitness expert at Cult.
What to keep in mind when doing the exercises listedAdvertisement
Imaginary skips and jumping jacks should be avoided by those with knee pain, arthritis, and low vitamin D, said Bakshi. “They can do jog on the spot 50 counts or jog around in the room for 2 minutes.”
Floor pushups should be avoided by those who have neck and shoulder pain issues. They can do wall push-ups instead.
Squats, if done right, can be done by everyone. “You just need to imagine that you are about to sit on a chair and stand and if you keep this in mind, your posture will always be right,” described Bakshi.

A 10-minute dead hang can be done by everyone. “If you have neck pain or shoulder pain, stick to a 10-second dead hang only,” said Bakshi.Advertisement
Plank can be done by everyone. Enjoy the build-up in core strength, improvement in flexibility, and reduced backache with planks.
Deep breathing will help in reducing stress and anxiety, shared Bakshi.
And since there is no dependency on where the workout can be done, people can do it in hotel rooms, airports, or just anywhere, said Telang.
What to keep in mind?
So even though the workout is done in small chunks, people should be mindful of their form and technique. Telang cautioned, “It’s also best to not push through the pain if at all there is any niggle or joint pains, best to consult a physiotherapist before pushing in the workout.”

"‘Spend five minutes on your skin every day, you will find that it looks revived, healthy’: Author and skin expert Vasudha Rai","To cut through the noise and so-called skincare trends, Vasudha Rai, author, and columnist, decided to conceptualise The Book of Holistic Beauty. The Audible Original goes beyond surface-level beauty concerns, addressing trending topics such as injectables, derma facials, and DIY skincare. In a digital age where misinformation is rampant on social media, the author aims to debunk misconceptions, addressing key concerns plaguing the beauty industry.
“I wanted women to have a ready recycler of sorts when it came to beauty. Additionally, I find that the beauty industry has become very binary. It’s chemical vs natural or DIY vs dermatologist. The truth however is that there is no black and white, right or wrong. Everything works in the right amount and excess of anything is bad. This book helps you find what the approach that suits you best, and how to balance natural remedies with skincare-backed skincare,” said Rai in an email interview with indianexpress.com.
The Delhi-based author who started her writing journey with her first book Glow in 2018 talks about the biggest skincare myths, the skin needs of men, and more.
Excerpts:Advertisement
What are some of the myths related to skincare that you would like to bust through this book?
That we need injectables. Or even derma facials for that matter. Yes, I do enjoy derma facials once in a while but I have found that the best transformation happens when you regularly and consistently take care of your skin. Of course, no one talks about consistency because it isn’t a hack but if you show up and spend five minutes on your skin every day, you will find that it looks revived and healthy.

Is there one skincare that works for all?
Regarding skincare products, it is a no, because we are all unique. However, I will say that adding a mindful activity such as breath work makes a difference in everyone’s skin. And this isn’t some snake oil technique. Now there are enough studies to show that mindful activities lead to a reduction of conditions such as eczema and psoriasis and also help maintain the length of our telogens, which indicate cellular ageing.
How important is skincare for men?Advertisement
Oh, that’s extremely important! I have a chunk of men who follow me and DM regularly for skincare tips. You’ll be surprised to know that one of the things that bothers men most is dark circles.
How was your experience of working on the audiobook?
It was excellent. I am always up for trying something new and the fact that I recorded the book in my own voice was a huge learning experience. Speaking in a way that is crystal clear and engaging is hard work. In fact, during the days I was recording, I barely went out or spoke over the phone because I wanted to give my voice the rest so it would sound fresh the next day. I was also working with two young sound engineers (Vivek and Kritikka) and it was a pleasure learning from young people and understanding the nuances that I would’ve never considered otherwise.

"Gulzar, Sanskrit scholar Rambhadracharya selected for Jnanpith Award","Renowned Urdu poet Gulzar and Sanskrit scholar Jagadguru Rambhadracharya have been named the recipients of the 58th Jnanpith Award, the Jnanpith selection committee announced on Saturday.
Gulzar is known for his works in Hindi cinema and is considered one of the finest Urdu poets of this era. He has earlier received Sahitya Akademi Award for Urdu in 2002, Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2013, Padma Bhushan in 2004, and at least five National Film awards for his works.
Rambhadracharya, the founder and head of Tulsi Peeth in Chitrakoot, is a renowned Hindu spiritual leader, educator and writer of more than 100 books.
In a statement, the Jnanpith selection committee said, “It has been decided to give the award (for 2023) to eminent writers from two languages: Sanskrit litterateur Jagadguru Rambhadracharya and well known Urdu litterateur Shri Gulzar.” Goan writer Damodar Mauzo had received the prestigious award for 2022.",lifestyle
What is millet milk and can it be used every day as regular milk?,"A cereal grain with tiny seeds that are grown and enjoyed all over the world is millet, which is used to make millet milk, a non-dairy beverage. Rich in vital elements like fibre, protein, vitamins, and minerals, millet grains are naturally gluten-free, said nutritionist Apurva Agarwal.
Who is it for?
Agarwal mentioned that regular milk “can be replaced with millet milk in a variety of culinary applications”. “It works well as an ingredient in both savoury and sweet recipes because of its mild flavour and creamy texture,” said Agarwal.
It is appropriate for anyone on a plant-based or vegan diet, intolerant to lactose, or allergic to cow’s milk, said Sushma PS, chief dietician, Jindal Naturecure Institute. Although millet milk is not as well-known or easily accessible as some other plant-based milk substitutes, such as soy or almond milk, it can nevertheless be utilised in a variety of culinary applications in place of conventional milk.Advertisement
How to make millet milk?
It is customary to soak, grind, and combine the grains with water to make millet milk. “To get a smooth and creamy milk-like consistency, the resultant liquid is filtered to remove any remaining solid particles,” shared Agarwal.
Types
A variety of millet kinds, such as finger millet (ragi), foxtail millet, pearl millet, and others, can be used to make millet milk. The particular variety of millet utilised can affect the milk’s flavour and nutritional value, said Sushma.
Dr Ranga Santosh Kumar, consultant general physician and diabetologist, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad described some millet milk in detail
Ragi Millet
Usually, overnight soaked or sprouted finger millet grains are used to make ragi milk. It’s an excellent substitute for dairy milk. Calcium, iron, antioxidants, and vitamin C are just a few nutrients that thrive in ragi milk.
Pearl Millet MilkAdvertisement
Pearl millet milk is made from pearl millet, also known as Bajra in India. This type of millet is nutritious and contains vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Pearl millet milk has a rich texture. It is also an enriched source of calcium and protein, making it a suitable option for boosting calcium intake.
Proso Millet Milk
Proso millet milk is made from proso millet which goes by names such as hog, white, and Kashif millet. In India, it is known as chena. This type of millet is high in fibre, which makes it an excellent choice for beverages that aid in digestive health. It is loaded with vital vitamins and minerals, calcium and protein. Employ proso millet milk to make pudding, ice creams, and creamy vegan desserts.
Foxtail Millet Milk
Foxtail millet milk is made from foxtail millet, which is also known as Italian millet. It has several vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, said Dr Kumar.

Browntop Millet MilkAdvertisement
Browntop millet milk is made from browntop millet, also known as korra in India. This millet is high in essential vitamins and minerals, such as calcium and protein. Browntop millet milk serves as a rich source of antioxidants.
Benefits
– Packed full of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, millet milk is a nutritional powerhouse. These nutrients support the immune system, bone health, and heart health, among other elements of health.
– Dietary fibre, which is present in millet milk, helps to maintain a healthy digestive system and ward off constipation. “Prebiotics are also included, which support a healthy gut microbiota by nourishing good gut bacteria,” Agarwal said.
According to Agarwal, millet milk is a healthy and safe substitute for dairy milk for people who have celiac illness or gluten intolerance. “Since millet grains are inherently gluten-free, millet milk is appropriate for a diet low in gluten,” said Agarwal.Advertisement
Millet milk is a good option for people who are controlling their weight because it has fewer calories than dairy milk. “Furthermore, the fibre content inhibits overeating by promoting fullness,” said Agarwal.

Is millet milk equivalent or better than regular milk?
It is a myth that it is equivalent to dairy milk such as cow and buffalo milk, urged Lakshita Jain, clinical dietitian and founder, NUTR, Delhi. “Millet milk offers the benefits of its respective millet but does not match the nutritional profile of cow or buffalo milk,” Jain said.
Things to keep in mind
*People who are allergic to millet or other grains should be cautious when ingesting millet milk and, if needed, seek medical advice.
*Depending on the type of millet used and any added fortifications, the nutritional value of millet milk can change, said Sushma. “Certain millet milk products that are sold commercially might have extra vitamins and minerals in them,” said Sushma.Advertisement
*Compared to regular dairy milk, millet milk may taste different and have a different texture. Its flavour is described by some as earthy or nutty, said Sushma.
*Sugars, stabilisers, or flavorings may be added to some commercially available millet milk products. “Pay close attention to the ingredient labels and, if at all feasible, select unsweetened or lightly processed foods,” said Agarwal.
*Depending on where you live, millet milk might not be as readily accessible as other plant-based milk substitutes.

Although most people can drink millet milk well, some people may have intolerance or digestive discomforts. Start slowly and pay attention to how your body reacts, Agarwal said. Sushma too agreed and shared that it’s important to take into account your unique nutritional demands and preferences while making any dietary changes. “Before adding millet milk to your diet, it is best to speak with a medical practitioner or a certified dietitian if you have any special health issues or dietary limitations,” noted Sushma.",lifestyle
What girl power looks like now,"Written by Vanessa Friedman
“Girl power, basically,” said Hillary Taymour, the designer of Collina Strada, backstage before her show at the start of New York Fashion Week. She wasn’t talking about bows and whistles; she was talking about the state of women in the world.
“I wanted to make a wardrobe to take on anything,” Taymour said, standing next to actress Gina Gershon, who was wearing a long plaid coat with the sleeves puffed and smocked from shoulder to wrist. The coat made Gershon look like a Shakespearean gym bunny. She smirked and announced, “I feel baller in this.” She didn’t have to make a muscle; they were built in for her.Advertisement
The whole Collina collection, including pastel floral latex shirts with sculpted abs and upcycled chiffon dresses with biceps and triceps quilted in, was a flex. Taymour even put a jacked model on the runway, perhaps the rarest sight on any catwalk.
The idea that women’s fashion might be about women’s power is so obvious that it risks seeming trite. But after seasons in thrall to discretion and femininity, at a time when women are having to battle for freedoms they once took for granted, clothing that centers unapologetic strength as a design principle is kind of thrilling. It was the biggest undercurrent in the New York shows.
The End of Naked Dressing
“Power,” Wes Gordon said before a Carolina Herrera show where he stripped away the froufrou to focus on construction: sharp shoulders, skirts with lines as clean as laboratory beakers, the clarity of black and white and red. “I think it’s very important that beauty and strength are not considered antonyms.”
“Power,” Michael Kors echoed. “Power suits.” That’s an old concept, but a photo of his grandparents’ 1930s wedding led him to redefine it by layering cashmere hoodies and lace slip dresses under double-breasted jackets, so the contrast did the heavy lifting.Advertisement
“Strength, independence,” Gabriela Hearst recited. She was describing the painter Leonora Carrington, her muse of the season, who happened to be one of the founders of the women’s liberation movement in Mexico and whose surrealist bent inspired Hearst to mess with material. Her lace was actually knit from cashmere; her denim made from recycled cotton and hemp.

The era of naked dressing appears to be over. In its place are clothes that, as Peter Do wrote in the notes for his sophomore Helmut Lang show, don’t only “protect us” but “project us.” (The idea was right on, though the execution was not as convincing. Do is still tripping over the Lang legacy.) Mike Eckhaus and Zoe Latta put it this way in their very good Eckhaus Latta show: “You are a logo” — all on your own.
In their hands that meant addictively atonal patchworks of stretch lace and glimmering knits, slouchy wide-wale cords and big faux-fur coats. In others, it meant garments that asserted their right to take up space.
See sweeping leather trenches and throwaway deb skirts at Coach; bristling tinsel coats and leather skirts that looked like unfolded origami at Tory Burch; boss-lady overcoats with detachable scarves that weaponize the neck at Proenza Schouler. There were even basic wools given the curves of an opera coat at Fforme, where Paul Helbers drapes so subtly you don’t even realize that what looks like a caftan is actually a batwing gown until the arms unfurl and it takes flight.Advertisement
Some Red Meat
Maybe that’s why Elena Velez decided that rather than stage a traditional catwalk show, it was time to host a “salon” featuring a discussion between the podcasters and cultural commentators Anna Khachiyan of “Red Scare” and Jack Mason of “The Perfume Nationalist,” on the subject of Scarlett O’Hara and “Gone With the Wind.” To accessorize the event, she had a few models (and Khachiyan) walking around in Tara corsetry and sweeping skirts, in a sort of text-to-trends scenario.
The point was to use fashion as a lubricant for substantive discussion, she said when welcoming people to her event. But while the premise promised controversy, it served up mostly faux transgression, avoiding the most problematic aspects of the book (its celebration of the confederacy; the role of slavery) in favor of performatively provocative statements about female agency.
The truth is, if Velez had simply let her clothes, which elevate off-cuts — fabric scraps that would otherwise be thrown away — in glossy silk and budget acetate to a high art and effectively shredded antebellum orthodoxies, do the talking for her, the result would have been more convincing. After all, that’s the promise of fashion: to allow people the liberty to excerpt it, and wield it, in any way they see fit.
To flip the narrative, as Joseph Altuzarra did in his 15th-anniversary show, held in his offices like a meet-and-greet. In underplaying the grandeur, it overscored on the individual. The Pierrot ruffles, soft ribbed jodhpurs and jet-beaded tuxedo shirt were seemingly made for women who lunch. On steak tartare.Advertisement
A New Story
When it comes to eating the scenery, however, no one makes a point more theatrically than Thom Browne, who used Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven” as his source material but then handed the authorial reins to a woman.
To be specific, Carrie Coon of “The Gilded Age,” whose voice-over recitation formed the soundtrack to a show set in a dark and desolate scene, with a mountainous black coat tree (literally, a man trapped in an ebony coat with skeletal branches for hands and atop his head) at its center.
Black snow fell on white ground as ravens (or, to be clear, raven-representing models) appeared in evermore elaborate constructions of black and white tweeds, leathers and tulle. Atop a base of black sheath dresses, coats and jackets were wrenched off the shoulder and blossomed over the hips in a New Look-on-steroids silhouette; exaggerated Poiret dresses ballooned to the calves; and intarsia ravens and roses were scattered over it all.
At the end, Coon shrieked the poem’s famous line in increasingly hysterical tones: “Nevermore. Nevermore,” and so on and on. Like the clothes, she was wonderfully impossible to ignore.",lifestyle
Is it necessary to quit chai on your fat loss journey?,"Since chai or tea is considered an emotion in India, the most important question that is often asked is whether it is necessary to quit the traditional Indian milk tea. If fitness and health influencer Shubhi Shivhare is to go by, the answer is no!
According to Shivhare, 100 ml of animal milk contains around 50-60 kcal, and 1 tsp of sugar (4.2 grams) gives you 16 kcal. “1 cup of chai made keeping in mind this measure gives you roughly between 100-110 kcal,” said Shivhare.
What makes fat loss difficult is the amount of “unnecessary white sugar you add in your cup of tea and also the snacks that are eaten with it like rusks, biscuits, khari, pakodas to name a few”.Advertisement
She explained that it’s completely acceptable to have 2 small cups of chai in a day depending on your daily calorie allowance and also your health issues if that asks you to cut a bit on caffeine.

Shivhare said:
– avoid having unnecessary sugar/jaggery with your tea cups instead have 0 kcal sweeteners like stevia or monk fruit.
– Don’t have more than 1 cup of chai if you have anxiety, high cortisol, high blood sugar level, and hyperacidity issues.
We turned to our in-house experts to understand more.Advertisement
Shruti K Bhardwaj, chief dietician, Zydus Hospitals, Ahmedabad said that if one is looking for weight reduction, it is recommended to reduce tea intake. “It has calories. Tea has tannins which hinder the absorption of iron and certain minerals,” said Bhardwaj.

Avoiding tea with a major meal is necessary. “Take it before meals and after meals only after maintaining a gap of one to two hours. If milk tea intake is more in a day, replace a few cups with green tea or black tea,” said Bhardwaj.
Like Shivhare, Bhardwaj also mentioned that one should limit the intake of sugar. “Jaggery or sugar has almost equal calories so it is recommended to limit their intake. One can choose brown sugar,” said Bhardwaj.
Dr Somnath Gupta, senior consultant physician and Diabetology, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad said that sugar control can help control cravings and prevent spikes in blood sugar levels, potentially aiding in fat loss. “Chai made with whole milk or cream can be high in saturated fats. By avoiding chai, you remove these high-fat ingredients from your diet, which may contribute to weight loss and improve overall heart health,” said Dr Gupta.
Opting for water or other low-calorie beverages in place of chai to help keep you hydrated without adding extra calories, mentioned Dr Gupta.",lifestyle
Healthy conflict might be key to the survival of your relationship,"Imagine a relationship devoid of conflict, a constant state of serene agreement. Sounds idyllic, doesn’t it? However, Dr Pavana S, consultant psychiatrist, relationship expert, and sexologist from Bangalore, warns us that such harmony might be hiding a deeper issue. Here’s why embracing healthy conflict, rather than fearing it, might be the key to a thriving relationship.
Communication: The Bedrock of Connection
At the heart of any healthy relationship lies effective communication. When concerns remain unspoken and emotions bottled up, misunderstandings fester, leading to conflict. This is where emotional literacy becomes crucial. Understanding, expressing, and validating emotions are essential skills that build trust and foster deeper connections. Active listening and empathy create a safe space for open dialogue, paving the way for conflict resolution and emotional well-being.
Embracing Conflict: A Sign of Growth
Ignoring conflict doesn’t make it disappear. It simply simmers beneath the surface, waiting to erupt in potentially more destructive ways. Dr Pavana emphasised that healthy conflict allows partners to address differences constructively. It creates an opportunity to understand each other’s perspectives, negotiate needs, and ultimately deepen the bond. Think of it as a workout for your emotional muscles, making your relationship more resilient and flexible.Advertisement

Building Emotional Intelligence: A Lifelong Journey
Developing emotional intelligence is an ongoing process. Setting clear boundaries, fostering open communication, and prioritizing self-awareness are key steps. This empowers individuals to navigate the complexities of relationships with greater understanding and resilience. Remember, emotional intelligence isn’t just for romantic relationships; it benefits all connections, platonic or otherwise.
The Dance of Togetherness: Finding the Right Balance
Every relationship needs a healthy balance between togetherness and personal space. While excessive distance can create emotional isolation, clinging too tightly can stifle individual growth. Open communication and understanding each other’s needs are crucial in finding this equilibrium. Regular check-ins ensure both partners feel safe, connected, and respected within the relationship.
Remember, conflict isn’t the enemy. It’s a natural part of any relationship, and when approached with emotional intelligence and open communication, it can be a powerful tool for growth and connection.
Key Takeaways:

Open communication and emotional literacy are essential for healthy relationships.
Conflict, when approached constructively, can strengthen bonds and understanding.
Developing emotional intelligence is a continuous journey that benefits all relationships.
Finding the right balance between togetherness and personal space is crucial.

So, the next time a disagreement arises, don’t shy away. Embrace it as an opportunity to connect deeper and build a stronger, more resilient relationship with your partner. After all, a little healthy conflict might just be the key to unlocking your relationship’s true potential.",lifestyle

Experts on whether coriander seeds water helps to relieve burning sensation after urination,"So many home remedies are followed diligently by many. As such, it becomes extremely important to understand what is beneficial for one’s health. So, when we came across a home remedy from lifestyle educator Anjali Mukherjee that mentioned coriander seeds water can help deal with the burning sensation after urination, we decided to ask our in-house experts whether it works.
Mukherjee mentioned that coriander seeds water helps to reduce the burning urination. “Do this for 2-10 days in case of mild burning,” said Mukherjee.
Mukherjee shared that the remedy comprises soaking one tablespoon of coriander seeds overnight in about 1 and a half cups of water. “Strain the infused water the next morning,” said Mukherjee.Advertisement
Dr Ashutosh Baghel, consultant urologist, andrologist, and kidney transplant surgeon, Wockhardt Hospitals Mira Road said that coriander seed water is like a “natural superhero that might help in fighting off urinary tract infections (UTIs)”.
Coriander seeds have something called antimicrobial properties – think of them as tiny warriors that can combat harmful bacteria. “Coriander seeds also have substances that might reduce inflammation. When you have a UTI, there’s often irritation and swelling in your urinary tract. The soothing effect of coriander seed water could help calm down this inflammation, making you feel more comfortable,” said Dr Baghel.
Additionally, there is the “flushing” effect. “Coriander seeds might work like a gentle cleaner for your urinary system. They may help in getting rid of toxins and waste, which is essential when you’re dealing with a UTI,” said Dr Baghel.
By creating an environment less conducive to bacterial proliferation, coriander seeds could contribute to the prevention or treatment of UTIs, added Dr Shobha Gupta, medical director and IVF specialist, Mother’s Lap IVF Centre New Delhi and Vrindavan.

You will have to pay tourism tax to go to Bali now so here’s how to make the most of your money,"The idyllic island of Bali recently implemented a new tourism tax, effective February 14, 2024. While this might add a small bump to your travel budget, don’t let it dampen your spirit!
With strategic planning and insider tips, you can still experience the magic of Bali and make the most of your trip.
Understanding the Tax
Amount: IDR 150,000 (approximately USD $10) per person, per visit.Advertisement
Who Pays: Applies to all international visitors except for Indonesian citizens, permanent residents, and specific visa holders.
Payment: Online payment preferred through the LOVE BALI website or app before arrival. Cash payment options are available at designated entry points.

Making the Most of Your Trip
Plan Efficiently: Combine your trip with other Indonesian destinations: If you’re planning to explore other parts of Indonesia like Lombok or the Gili Islands, consider a multi-destination trip to optimise your tax payment. You’ll only pay the tax once if you re-enter Bali from another Indonesian province.
Choose longer stays: The per-person fee makes longer stays more cost-effective. Consider extending your trip to truly immerse yourself in Balinese culture and explore hidden gems beyond the popular tourist spots.Advertisement
Venture beyond the beaten path: Explore less-frequented temples, waterfalls, and villages for a more authentic experience. Ubud, Munduk, and Sidemen offer stunning landscapes and a glimpse into traditional Balinese life.
Support local businesses: Choose locally-owned guesthouses, homestays, and restaurants instead of large chains. This not only saves you money but also supports the local community and benefits the island’s economy directly.
Embrace cultural activities: Participate in traditional dance performances, cooking classes, or batik workshops. These immersive experiences offer deeper connections to the Balinese way of life and create lasting memories.\
Minimise waste: Be mindful of your plastic consumption and opt for reusable water bottles and shopping bags. Many eco-conscious businesses offer discounts for responsible travelers.Advertisement
Support responsible accommodation: Opt for hotels and resorts committed to sustainability practices like water conservation, renewable energy, and community engagement.
Remember: The tourism tax aims to support responsible tourism development, infrastructure improvement, and cultural preservation in Bali. By being a mindful and responsible traveller, you can contribute positively to the island’s well-being while savoring your unforgettable Balinese experience.
Bonus Tip: Learn some basic Bahasa Indonesia phrases! Locals appreciate the effort and it can enhance your interactions with the community.
Embrace the adventure, explore responsibly, and let the beauty of Bali captivate you!",lifestyle
"Ustaad, not a chef: Imtiaz Qureshi, known for reviving the ‘dum pukht’ cooking style, dies at 93","Culinary doyen Imtiaz Qureshi, the man known for reviving the ‘dum pukht’ cooking style – a traditional slow-cooking technique — and establishing iconic restaurants like Bukhara and Dum Pukht, passed away on Friday morning in Mumbai. He was 93.
Qureshi is survived by five sons and two daughters — Aisha, Ishtiyaque, Ashfaque, Irfan, Yasmin, Imran and Muhammad Ahsan Ali, who are all in the culinary profession and have restaurants in India and abroad.
“He was admitted in Lilavati for the last two weeks due to old-age issues,” shared chef Ishtiyaque Qureshi, his eldest son, adding that there were issues with his vital organs.Advertisement
“He was a strong man with stronger willpower. Even in his last days, he had a smile on his face every time the nurses attended him or he spoke to his grandchildren on video calls. This morning at about 4 am, he developed some complications from which he couldn’t recover.”
Calling him a ‘guru’, Ishtiyaque, who owns Bandra-based Kakori House, shared that work was worship for him. “He was a gifted man who showed a path to thousands of people. In the past eight years since his retirement from ITC Hotels, we sat together and wrote things, performed experiments and played around with recipes. Even in the hospital, he was making plans of what we would do together once he returned home,” he said, adding that he taught his children the art of ‘dum pukht’, that it “can’t be contained to a menu but needs to be deep-dived into and further explored and expanded”.
“He would always talk about developing the cuisine further while retaining its authenticity, and saying that keep experimenting till it gives you satisfaction,” he said.
A descendant of khansamas of the Mughal rulers and nawabs, Qureshi hailed from Lucknow and started his culinary journey as a nine-year-old during the British Raj. He joined his uncle who was charged with preparing food for 10,000 British soldiers without any fancy equipment or electricity. He later joined Krishna Caterers, which was responsible for feeding jawans in Lucknow during the India-China war in 1962. It was during this job that he was entrusted with preparing a meal, all by himself due to security concerns, for then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru for a state banquet in 1962. Such was the meal that Nehru went on to hire Krishna Caterers for the opening of the Ashok Hotel in Delhi, where he prepared kebabs, biryani, murg mussalam and a dal that eventually became ‘Dal Bukhara’.Advertisement
His culinary prowess caught the attention of Ajit Haksar, the founder of ITC Hotels, who hired him sometime in the mid-1970s. He stood his ground to cook in copper vessels, something that ended up becoming an integral part of cooking at the hotel chain. It is here that his cooking technique of ‘dum pukht’ got attention and his dishes became the name of the restaurants he established and successfully ran, earning him many accolades over the years. In 2016, he was conferred with Padma Shri, the fourth-highest civilian award.
“He may have been from Lucknow but the world was his oyster,” said Diwan Gautam Anand, who was the banquet manager at ITC Maurya when Qureshi worked there as the master chef.
“He wasn’t making just one cuisine but would pick up dishes and recipes from conversations with various chefs from India and abroad, or from visits to different regions, and make them his own. I remember having ‘Saat Nizam Ki Dal’ which he picked up from Hyderabad,” shared Anand, while crediting Qureshi for bringing “a renaissance to Indian food”.
“He understood that the trick lies in ingredients. He was particular about the quality of ingredients – he had his own potli masala – and water so much so that he would check the pH,” he said.
Having retired from ITC Hotels as Grand Master Chef a few years ago, Anand called him a large-hearted man who “would go to the table and ask his guests what they like and ensure that they have a good experience.”Advertisement
Restaurateur Zorawar Kalra, whose father, late culinary maverick Jiggs Kalra, and Qureshi, were contemporaries, says that the latter was “majorly responsible for popularising North India’s favourite Dum Biryani”.
“He showed the essence of a man in love with his craft. In some sense, he was India’s first celebrity chef. He worked closely with my father to bring about a renaissance in Awadhi cuisine. He was a doyen and his indelible mark will always remain and he will always be considered India’s foremost culinary ambassador,” said Kalra.
Chef Ranveer Brar, who also hails from Lucknow, recalled growing up hearing stories about Qureshi and his legendary kebabs.
“We idolised him. Wherever you went in the city, people had stories about him, like where he lived, where he cooked, and his legendary kebabs. But because he had moved to Delhi by then, there was no way I could have them. So, when I was working as a trainee chef at Taj Palace in Delhi, I took my salary of Rs 612 and went to ITC Maurya next door to have his famed Galouti Kebab at Dum Pukht. That moment was huge for me because, finally, I had reached the space where I could taste his kebabs,” shared Brar, adding that Qureshi brought such a flair and panache to the Lucknowi cuisine that it is indebted to him.Advertisement
Brar, who eventually went on to work with him on several projects, admitted initially being intimidated by his aura. But what stood out for him was Qureshi’s curiosity. “I met him last about a-year-and-a-half ago for MasterChef and he was constantly picking up something or the other, thinking how he could treat a particular ingredient, he was constantly thinking.”
Sadaf Hussain, a Delhi-based food consultant and one of the contenders of MasterChef India in 2016, shared how he was an ‘ustaad’ and not a chef. “The difference between the two is that chefs have a culinary degree and an air around them but ustaads are giving. Because Qureshi came from such a lineage, he never showed off and went on to elevate food the way only he could.”
“Chefs can give you a recipe but ‘ustaads’ will give you life lessons in the kitchen. They will share the recipe when they think the time is right and when they know that it will stay with you… he was very giving towards the later years of his life,” added Brar.
Stating that Bukhara won’t be the same without him, Delhi-based historian and author Rana Safvi said, “At a time when not much was known about Awadh’s food, he defined the way Awadhi cuisine was perceived by people. His Dum Biryani and kebabs are legendary.”Advertisement
“Very few chefs in the world have attained the status of institutions,” said celebrity chef Vikas Khanna, adding, “Chef Qureshi is forever immortal. His contribution to the global domination of Indian cuisine is infinite.”",lifestyle
‘Living life on my own terms’: What is fanning the flames of the FIRE movement in IndiaPremium Story,"For decades, the image of retirement in India has been synonymous with an elderly gentleman, perhaps your grandfather’s age, seated on a porch, rocking in a wheelchair, his grey hair catching the fading light of his twilight years. However, a paradigm shift is underway. With the entry of millennials and Gen Z into the workforce, the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement is rewriting the narrative surrounding retirement.
Emerging in 1992 with the popularity of the book, Your Money or Your Life, the FIRE movement gained prominence because of its tantalising promise of “freedom and autonomy”, according to Dr Taranjeet, dean of the School of Behavioral and Social Sciences at MRIIRS.
While initially sounding like a pipe dream, a survey by PGIM India Mutual Fund in 2023 revealed that a staggering 67 per cent of Indians are contemplating early retirement, some eyeing it as young as 33 years of age.Advertisement
So, what is so attractive about the FIRE movement?

For Karan Cheema, 26, it represents the pursuit of a life lived on his terms. “By achieving FIRE, I would feel in control of my time, money, and most importantly, my destiny,” says Cheema, founder of WittyWeb Studio, a digital marketing agency.
He envisions reaching the pinnacle of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. “I will finally be able to close my laptop, stop my brain from thinking, and just enjoy life as it comes,” he adds.
Another advantage, Cheema feels is the opportunity to travel and pursue his hobbies. “Every day could bring a new adventure, a new hobby,” he muses. However, his ultimate aspiration is “a life free from fear, full of peace and happiness.”
Aanandita Vaghani, founder and mental health counselor at UnFix, echoes this sentiment: “Early retirement provides freedom from the shackles of work deadlines, particularly for those in demanding professions. It allows individuals to explore passions that may be stifled by the demands of work, fostering increased physical activity and promoting better mental health.”Advertisement
On the other hand, Chetna Arora, 23, is attracted to the independence the FIRE life offers. Having battled stereotypes and sexism as a woman from a middle-class family, Arora sees financial independence as a gateway to a “sorted life”, which motivates her to strive for it. “Financial independence is liberating, especially for a woman. Adding the prospect of early retirement means I can afford a comfortable life for me and my family,” she says.
Agreeing, Dr Taranjeet explains that the appeal of FIRE lies in escaping the 9-to-5 grind and reclaiming time for meaningful pursuits. “It resonates with many, especially Gen Z, who crave autonomy and fulfilment. Offering self-oriented success, FIRE focuses on experiences over material possessions and promotes balanced, purpose-driven living,” she says.
As for S Ravi, founder of Ravi Rajan & Co., the FIRE movement attracts those who prioritise time over traditional career trajectories. “It’s driven by the belief that time is a precious commodity, and achieving financial freedom affords greater control and satisfaction in life,” he says.
However, it’s not all hunky-dory. 
A recent survey by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies found that only 17 per cent of early retirees do so willingly after saving enough money. The remaining are either “kicked out, edged out, or quit due to ill health.”Advertisement
Cheema, too, acknowledges the “tremendous toll pursuing the FIRE lifestyle will take on the body. There will be a lot of stress, pressure, and the fear of failure, which will affect both the mind and the body, and that will lead to health-related issues.”
While Anushree Gupta, 23, a counselling psychologist, considers this a structured strategy to foster goal attainment, she says it carries the risk of burnout. “The singular focus may lead to emotional and physical duress, potentially impacting relationships and self-care,” she says.
Some critics also argue against its sustainability and feasibility. “Unless you have a really fat salary package at a very young age, most individuals will have to undertake stricter saving methods to attain the FIRE life,” explains S Ravi. “Achieving early retirement often requires aggressive and planned saving. For normal-wage workers, huge penances might be required, influencing leisure activities. Unanticipated situations like illness, big fat weddings, or monetary slumps can also upset plans,” he adds.
Moreover, Gupta emphasises the trade-off between present enjoyment and future security inherent in saving and investing for FIRE. The relentless pursuit of financial goals may inadvertently isolate individuals from social interactions and experiences, she cautions.Advertisement
Not only this. Early retirement can pose risks to mental health, as Vaghani explains. “The absence of meaningful work can lead to a sense of purposelessness, impacting psychological well-being. Additionally, the cognitive challenges and social interactions inherent in work are vital for maintaining executive functioning skills and emotional intelligence,” she opines.

Here are tips to attain a FIRE life:

Set clear goals and budget: Pre-define the target savings amount, budget, and personal goals while setting practical timelines to achieve the same.
Increase income, lower expenses: Embrace a minimalist lifestyle by focusing on essentials and avoiding unnecessary expenses while increasing income sources through side hustles, freelancing, and upskilling.
Build an emergency fund: This will help you cover unexpected costs without having to dip into your long-term investments.
Invest wisely and monitor progress: Channel your additional income toward strategically planned investments. Regularly review your financial progress and adjust your strategies as needed.
Prioritise self-care: Keep your physical and mental health through self-care habits to maintain resilience and productivity. Ensure you have adequate insurance coverage for health, property, and other risks.
Seek support: Surround yourself with like-minded individuals or join online communities for support, encouragement, and shared knowledge.
Enjoy the journey: While working towards financial independence, remember to enjoy the present moment and appreciate the process of pursuing your goals.

Can PCOS be cured naturally? Experts weigh in,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) affects millions of women worldwide, causing a range of symptoms from irregular periods and fertility issues to weight gain and hormonal imbalances. While conventional treatments often involve medication to manage symptoms, many women seek alternative methods to alleviate the effects of PCOS naturally. But can PCOS truly be cured without medication?
If nutritionist Apurwa Agarwal is to go by, then PCOS can be naturally cured by “30 mins walk, limited sugar, eating fibre daily, quality protein in every meal, and Omega 3 and vitamin D.”
However, the reality is far more complex. Dr Rashmi Dharaskar, senior consultant obstetrics and gynaecology, Surya Mother and Child Super speciality Hospital, Pune tells indianexpress.com that while there is no cure for the syndrome, there are several ways in which PCOS can be managed.Advertisement
“Lifestyle management, including dietary habits and regular exercise remain pivotal tools to control the symptoms, which include missed or irregular periods, ovaries with large or several cysts, excess body hair, weight gain, acne and infertility, among others,” she says.
Here are some natural remedies to manage PCOS: 
Balanced diet
Dietary modifications play a crucial role in managing PCOS symptoms naturally. Studies suggest that a diet low in dairy and carbohydrates can aid in weight loss, improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce excess testosterone levels in women with PCOS.
Incorporating complex carbohydrates like whole grains, whole wheat products, fruits, and vegetables, along with lean proteins, in your diet, while avoiding simple carbohydrates and sugars such as white bread, pasta, rice, cereal, cookies, and chips.
Weight management
Weight management is essential for restoring ovulation and regulating menstrual cycles in women with PCOS. Research indicates that losing between 5% to 10% of body weight can help manage PCOS symptoms and reduce the risk of chronic conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.Advertisement
Individuals can focus on weight management through a combination of dietary changes and regular exercise to regulate hormones, improve physical symptoms, and enhance emotional well-being for those with PCOS.
Alleviate stress
Stress management techniques, such as yoga, meditation, deep breathing exercises, or mindfulness practices, can help reduce stress levels and cortisol production, which may contribute to hormonal imbalances in women with PCOS.
Additionally, prioritising adequate sleep and establishing a consistent sleep schedule are also essential for hormone regulation and overall health.
Supplements and herbal remedies
Certain supplements and herbal remedies have gained popularity in the natural treatment of PCOS. Inositol, a B-vitamin-like compound, has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and ovarian function in women with PCOS.Advertisement
Similarly, supplements such as omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, and magnesium may offer benefits in managing PCOS symptoms.
Herbal remedies like chasteberry (vitex), cinnamon, and spearmint tea have also been studied for their potential to regulate menstrual cycles and reduce androgen levels in women with PCOS.

Here are 10 food swaps for a healthier life,"In the journey towards better health, the choices we make in the kitchen can have a significant impact on our overall well-being. By making simple yet effective food swaps, we can transform our diets and set ourselves on a path to a healthier, more vibrant life. Don’t know where to start? Nutritionist Sakshi Lalwani took to Instagram to share 10 food swaps that can make us go from “lazy goers to fitness lovers in no time”. “Changes can be seen within the very first week of making these,” she wrote in the caption.


Full cream milk to A2 milk


Sangeeta Tiwari, a clinical nutritionist at Artemis Lite in Delhi, told indianexpress.com that full cream milk has a higher fat content, resulting in a richer taste and good texture. Furthermore, it also contains A1 and A2 proteins. A2 milk, on the other hand, only has the A2 type of beta-casein protein and doesn’t have the A1 protein found in traditional cow’s milk.
“A2 milk is easier to digest for people who are sensitive to A1 protein, potentially lessening issues like bloating and digestive problems. Those who are lactose intolerant or dairy sensitive can also choose A2 milk,” she explained.Advertisement


Butter to avocado mash


According to Tiwari, butter has saturated fats and cholesterol, which is why its excess consumption should be avoided. Meanwhile, avocado mash is a nutritious choice made from mashed ripe avocados. “Avocados are rich in healthy fats, especially monounsaturated fats that are beneficial for heart health. Additionally, avocado mash has a creamy texture which is quite similar to butter. It is also a great choice for those following a plant-based or vegan diet,” she said.


Potato chips to kale chips


Tiwari noted that while potato chips are popular for their taste and crispy texture, they are rich in unhealthy fats, high in calories, and sodium. “These can be consumed occasionally but their frequent consumption can result in weight gain, heart problems, and high blood pressure,” she said.
Meanwhile, kale chips are made from kale leaves that are nutrient-rich, made by drying or baking them. “Kale has a high content of vitamins A, C, and K, and minerals like calcium and manganese. They have lower calories and fats, which makes them a healthier alternative,” Tiwari added.


Vegetable oil to avocado oil


Vegetable oil is a term that includes various oils derived from plants like corn, sunflower, soybean, or canola. These oils are typically used in cooking for their neutral flavour and high smoke point. However, Tiwari explained that they often undergo refining processes that strip them of their nutrients and antioxidants. “Certain vegetable oils like corn and soybean are also rich in omega-6 fatty acids that are likely to result in inflammation if they are not balanced with omega-3 fatty acids in the diet,” she said.Advertisement
Avocado oil, on the other hand, is extracted from the pulp of avocados and has great health benefits. “It has monounsaturated fats that are good for heart health and help in reducing inflammation. It also has vitamin E that helps in protecting cells against damage. The mild buttery flavor of avocado makes it a good choice for cooking,” Tiwari said.


Mayonnaise to Greek yogurt


While mayonnaise is made from oil, egg yolks, vinegar, and seasoning, Greek yogurt is a strained yogurt that has a thicker consistency and a higher protein content in comparison to regular yogurt. “Mayo is high in calories, saturated fats, and cholesterol, making it an unhealthy choice. Greek yogurt, however, is lower in calories and fats, and also provides probiotics that support gut health,” Tiwari explained.


Processed meat to lean meat


Processed meats may be convenient and tasty, but choosing lean meats is a healthier choice because it has fewer additives and lower risks of negative health effects.
Tiwari said that processed meats are flavourful but have a high content of sodium, saturated fats, and additives like nitrates, which lead to an increased risk of heart disease, cancer, weight gain, and other health problems. Meanwhile, lean meats have minimal fat content and offer vital nutrients like protein, iron, zinc, and B vitamins without the excess saturated fat and sodium that are found in processed meats. “Lean meats are versatile and can be made in various ways, like grilling, baking, broiling, or sautéing. This makes them suitable for a wide range of dishes and cuisines,” she added.Advertisement


Soda or aerated drinks to water infused with fruits


According to Tiwari, water infused with fruits is a better choice as it is hydrating, nutritious, and has various other health benefits. “Soda or aerated drinks are high in sugar, preservatives, artificial flavors all of which have negative health effects like tooth decay, weight gain, and increased risk of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes and heart problems. Water infused with fruits, on the other hand, is refreshing, hydrating, and provides various health benefits without any side effects. They are low in calories, support digestion, metabolism and help in curbing sugar cravings,” she said.


Granola bar to nuts


Both granola bars and nuts can be convenient snacks, but nuts offer superior nutritional value with fewer added sugars and processed ingredients. “Granola bars can provide a quick energy boost and are indeed very convenient for quick snacking, but they can also be high in added sugars and processed ingredients. Nuts are loaded with healthy fats, protein, fibre, vitamins, and minerals. They offer various health benefits, like supporting heart health, improving brain function, and helping in weight management. They are a satisfying snack that can help in curbing hunger and provide energy throughout the day,” Tiwari said.


Table salt to black rock salt


Also known as refined salt, table salt is most commonly used in households. It typically contains added iodine which is a nutrient important for thyroid function. Black rock salt, also known as Kala Namak or Himalayan black salt, on the other hand, is a type of volcanic rock salt that has a distinctive colour and flavour. It is less refined in comparison to table salt and has more minerals.
“In terms of health, both table and rock salt must be consumed in moderation. However, black rock salt contains slightly less sodium than table salt, making it a better option for those watching out their sodium intake,” Tiwari advised.Advertisement


White bread to sourdough bread


White bread is made from highly refined wheat flour, and therefore has a soft texture and mild flavour. But the refining process strips away most of the fibre, vitamins, and minerals present in the wheat kernel, leaving it with fewer nutrients and a higher glycemic index. This results in high sugar levels.
Sourdough bread, on the other hand, is made through a fermentation process using wild yeast and lactobacilli bacteria which not only gives it a tangy flavour but also breaks down some of the gluten and phytic acid present in the flour, making it easier to digest. The fermentation process further increases the content of certain nutrients like zinc, iron, and magnesium that support gut health.

“White bread has a better taste in comparison to sourdough bread but those who want a healthier alternative prefer sourdough bread because of nutrition value and digestive benefits,” Tiwari recommended.

The mob wife aesthetic is everywhere but what exactly is it and how can you ace it?,"2024 is fully upon us and the first fashion trend to blow up on social media worldwide is a blast of fresh air compared to the quiet, posh looks (remember quiet luxury?) we’ve seen lately. This time, we’re ditching subtlety for a bolder, messier, and unapologetically fierce vibe – the mob-wife aesthetic; and it’s just the dose of fun and energy we’ve all been craving. So, what exactly is this mob-wife trend, you ask? Think fierce animal prints, blingtastic jewellery, black leather that shines, and (arguably the most important ensemble piece this season) a fabulous faux fur coat that screams luxury.
Fashion’s favourite girls like Hailey Bieber, Kendall Jenner and Dua Lipa, have already given this trend their thumbs-up. And with the 25th anniversary of the Sopranos just gone, this resurgence couldn’t have come at a better time. As Carmela Soprano herself taught us, clothes only tell half the story. It’s all about that “messy bun, who cares?” approach to hair and a glam makeup look that packs a punch, smoky eyes and red lips included. The mob-wife is flashy, she’s loaded, and she wants you to know it the second you lay eyes on her. She’s a walking statement, and she’s owning it.

The Allure of Mob Wife Fashion: Why is it gaining popularity now?
This style is highlighted by pop culture’s ability to sway viewers through movies and television series that frequently have attractive mob wife-type characters, according to designer Shilpi Gupta. Not to mention, those looking for a sophisticated and vintage style are drawn to the fashion trend’s elegant and classic components.Advertisement
In addition, social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok have emerged to be significant players in the field of fashion, boosting its exposure and appeal. The mob wife look is defined by a strong and dynamic manner that gives women a chance to exhibit their authority and refinement while also expressing themselves in an exquisite and bold way, explained Gupta.
How to Ace the Mob Wife Look
According to designer Shilpi Gupta, elite clothing, iconic silhouettes, striking accessories, refined aesthetics, evocative cultural symbolism, confidence, and charisma are all important components of this visual language.

“The signature vibe is defined by conventional styles like pencil skirts, blazers, and fitted bodices, as well as striking accents featuring huge, statement jewellery and expensive clutches. Folks who follow this fashion trend have the option to use a few or all of these aspects to create a honed, exquisite appearance. This could include defined eyebrows, bold red lips, winged eyeliner, strappy, elegant high heels, self-confidence, and personality that oozes a sense of power and effect,” Gupta said.",lifestyle
Fashionable fan apparel is in the spotlight. There’s still an untapped market for the NFL,"It started as a fun project. A white bodysuit, emblazoned with Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Jake Browning’s number and initials.
Taylor Damron had made it for her cousin, Browning’s girlfriend Stephanie Niles, to wear to the Jan. 7 game against the Cleveland Browns. Then, the outfit went viral.
“The next day, I woke up, and the world had kind of fallen in my lap,” Damron, 29, says.Advertisement
Damron’s design rocketing to internet fame is just one story of how women’s fan apparel has found itself in the spotlight. Just a few days later, Taylor Swift would don a red puffer jacket with boyfriend and Kansas City Chiefs’ tight end Travis Kelce’s number for his game against the Miami Dolphins.
Within a month, that jacket’s designer, Kristin Juszczyk, would score an NFL licensing deal.
These meteoric success stories have illustrated the potency of a market for women’s sports apparel that merges fashion and fan culture. They have also highlighted how hard it is for smaller, independent creators to break into the business — especially Black designers, who popularized and innovated sportswear-as-womenswear two decades ago.
Before Swift catapulted Juszczyk’s clothes to a new level of attention, the 29-year-old designer built a following online by repurposing jerseys into more high-fashion pieces — corsets, suits, skirts — for herself as she attended San Francisco 49ers games to support her husband, fullback Kyle Juszczyk. Her NFL chic couture has spread to other players’ partners and supporters across the league, including Simone Biles, Taylor Lautner and Brittany Mahomes.Advertisement
Before Juszczyk sent Swift and Mahomes jackets for the Jan. 13 game, she had about 100,000 followers, according to Social Blade. Within a month, she had more than 1 million.
With her official license in hand, Juszczyk designed puffer vests commemorating Super Bowl LVIII, sported by celebrities. One such vest sold for $75,000, with proceeds going to the National Breast Cancer Foundation. Juszczyk herself wore a jacket stitched from jerseys, an ode to her husband’s football career, for Sunday’s big game.
While players’ wives and girlfriends have long represented their partners with custom designs, adopting team colors, logos and numbers, the interplay of fashion and gameday apparel was energized in the ’90s and early aughts, when Black artists were “pushing the needle of what was cool and trendy,” says Tayler Adigun, a culture and style writer.
“A lot of up-and-coming entertainers in the Black sphere maybe had difficulty getting larger names or fashion houses to want to outfit them or costume them for events and award shows and performances, so they kind of had to be a little bit more innovative in their approach,” Adigun says. “It’s something that was definitely born out of necessity.”Advertisement
It led to a fusion of sportswear, fan merchandise and cutting-edge design, she says. And, of course, iconic looks: Mya’s blue North Carolina jersey dress was one. Then there was Mariah Carey in a floor-length Washington Wizards dress. Carey’s dress prompted a surge of interest, and the NBA increased the designs they had in their NBA4her collection, according to a 2003 Baltimore Sun article.
When Larena Hoeber began doing research on women and sports, she didn’t set out to study apparel. But women kept bringing up how difficult it was to find something they actually wanted to wear to rep their teams. A decade ago, licensed women’s merchandise was often made with three key principles: “pink it, bling it, shrink it,” Hoeber says.
Sports leagues not taking risks on smaller creators is to their own detriment, says Hoeber, a University of Regina professor who has written about women’s sportswear and its perceptions. Smaller designers sometimes understand the market, and women’s varying desires, better.“What’s really critical for women, I think, as sports fans, is they want the official logo, like they want it to look like, ‘This is it. I’m supporting my team,’” she adds. “So, they want that, but they want it in clothing that matches their style.”
Women have wanted variety, and sports leagues have often underestimated the market, leading to innovation. Damron, who designed Niles’ viral bodysuit, launched a new collection of themed clothing that nod toward league teams after an outpouring of interest.Advertisement
At Frankie Collective, employee Sara Gourlay saw a chance to rework vintage jerseys that weren’t selling — they became women’s streetwear, including corsets and crops, says Zak Miller, head of operations. The mission of the company is sustainability, and even without licensing deals, they’ve partnered with big brands like Adidas and Nike, or even the National Hockey League, to keep clothes from ending up in landfills. “I thank Kristin just for the fact that, like, hey, she’s brought some visibility to an industry that has been around for a period of time right now,” Miller says.
Her high-fashion pieces stand out among other NFL license holders, which include powerhouse companies like Nike, Under Armour and Fanatics. (Juszczyk isn’t alone, though: Kiya Tomlin, a designer whose husband Mike Tomlin is the head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers, has a license for her high-end apparel.)

Juszczyk did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A spokesperson for the NFL said that the league has a standard application process for all partners, like Juszcyzk. A number of programs seek to make it easier for smaller companies to partner with the league, he added. Twenty years ago, when fashion like this was taking shape, there weren’t the same partnerships and opportunities, Adigun says.
On one hand, Alexis Robinson, 32, is glad to see Juszczyk got a license.Advertisement
“I’m glad more of this stuff can start being made,” Robinson, a Black designer who runs Boujee Basics, says. “And then on the other hand, it’s like it sucks because it’s been getting made for a long time and it’s just the process has been nearly impossible.”
Robinson started by making cropped denim jackets for herself. As they caught on, she started looking into licenses. It kicked off applications to all major leagues — from basketball, to football, to hockey and baseball. While it was a relatively simple process, with fees for all of them, she never heard back about her application to the NFL.
The upfront costs were too steep for another Black designer, De’fron Fobb, 45, who wanted to craft items when the New Orleans Saints made the Super Bowl in 2010. Since then, the Louisiana native has focused his apparel on college sports. He’s followed Juszczyk’s work for a while, he says.
“She does great work. Her designs and custom stuff is amazing,” he says. “But again, she’s fortunate enough to be in that field. So, it’s a different lane for her than it is for most small business, like myself.”Advertisement
Hoeber hopes the attention will open the door for more creators.

“Women are not a homogeneous group or a homogeneous market,” she says. “I think we’re starting to see cracks with recognizing that, it wasn’t just an offering of, ‘We’re going to take the men’s stuff and shrink it down to women.’”",lifestyle
Is rosemary the miracle ingredient you need for healthy hair?,"We all desire long, luscious locks straight out of a shampoo commercial, and we go to great lengths to achieve this result. Some of us also turn to natural ingredients to boost our hair health. One such ingredient being deemed as miraculous for healthy hair is rosemary. According to nutritionist Apurwa Agarwal, this medicinal plant can turn your brittle, coarse hair to those out of your dreams.
However, is this claim really valid? We reached out to experts to find out.
Dr Reshma T Vishnani, consultant dermatologist, trichologist and aesthetic dermatologist at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Mumbai told indianexpress.com that rosemary improves microcapillary perfusion (blood circulation), which can lead to new hair growth and control hair fall. Additionally, it has antibacterial and antioxidant effects.
But Dr Vishnani cautioned that rosemary can be used as an adjuvant therapy but not as a mainline treatment. “I do not recommend rosemary or any oil in the treatment of hair fall. There is little evidence in peer-reviewed journals about its benefits or side effects. The only place we hear about it is on social media.”Advertisement
She added that if you still want to use rosemary, it can be applied as an oil 30 minutes or one hour prior to your hair wash for its conditioning benefits.
The other ways rosemary can be used is as a hair rinse, overnight mist mixed with apple cider vinegar, hair mask with aloe vera gel, or hair oil combined with jojoba, almond and coconut oil, Agarwal mentioned in her Instagram post.

Do you watch shows while eating? Here’s how it is harming you,"In today’s fast-paced world, multitasking has become the norm — even extending to our mealtimes. One common habit many of us have adopted is eating while watching our favourite shows or movies. While it might seem harmless or even enjoyable, according to nutritionist Apurwa Agarwal, “eating while watching television can make you sick.”


You tend to eat more


When you watch television while eating, Agarwal explains that “your mind is distracted,” and “you fail to realise how much and what you are eating.”
Ruchika Jain, chief clinical nutritionist at Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, told indianexpress.com that this can lead to overeating. “When you’re engrossed in a show or movie, you’re less likely to pay attention to your body’s signals of hunger and fullness. This can lead to eating beyond the point of satiety, which can contribute to weight gain and digestive discomfort,” she said.Advertisement


You might binge on junk food


Another reason, Agarwal notes, is that you might choose quantity over quality when watching television, opting mostly for packaged foods loaded with calories.
“TV watching often goes hand-in-hand with consuming snacks and convenience foods that are high in calories, sugar, fat, and salt. These foods, such as chips, cookies, and soda, can lead to poor nutrition, weight gain, and various other health problems over time,” Jain explained.


You are at risk of obesity


Citing studies, Agarwal emphasises that dining or eating while watching TV puts you at risk of obesity, especially in kids. “It not only slows down your metabolic rate but also increases your risk of obesity.”
Agreeing, Jain says that a combination of mindless eating, poor food choices, decreased awareness of satiation, and reduced physical activity associated with TV watching can contribute to weight gain and obesity over time.Advertisement


You might not feel satiated


When you sit in front of the TV and eat, Agarwal explains that your mind is focused on watching TV, which blocks the feeling of satisfaction. “Even though you might have eaten a lot, you end up feeling less fuller.”
To mitigate the negative impacts of eating while watching TV, Jain advises practicing mindful eating, choosing healthier snack options, limiting portion sizes, and being mindful of how much time you spend in front of the television.
“Practicing mindful eating involves bringing full attention to the experience of eating, savouring each bite, and being fully present without distractions,” Jain said.

Here are some steps you can follow:

Before you start eating, take a moment to pause and take a few deep breaths. This helps center yourself and bring your attention to the present moment.
Notice the colours, textures, and smells of your food before you take a bite. Engage all your senses in the experience of eating.
Take your time to chew each bite thoroughly and savour the flavours of the food. Put your fork down between bites to slow down the pace of your eating.
Tune in to your body’s hunger and fullness signals. Eat when you’re hungry and stop when you’re satisfied, rather than eating out of habit or boredom.
Try to eat in a quiet and peaceful environment without distractions like TV, phones, or computers. Focus solely on the act of eating.
Avoid judging yourself or your food choices. Approach eating with an attitude of kindness and acceptance towards yourself.
Take a moment to appreciate the food in front of you and the effort that went into preparing it. Cultivate a sense of gratitude for the nourishment it provides your body.
Pay attention to how different foods make you feel physically and emotionally. Notice how your body responds to different foods and adjust your choices accordingly.
You can also try specific mindful eating exercises, such as the raisin meditation, where you mindfully eat a single raisin, paying attention to its texture, taste, and sensations.

Like any skill, mindful eating takes practice. “Try to incorporate mindfulness into your meals regularly, even if it’s just for a few minutes each day,” Jain recommended.

"Does broccoli have double the vitamin C of oranges, match milk’s calcium, and is more easily absorbed by our bodies?","The new favorite in Indian households is broccoli. While it does provide a nutritious fare, we wanted to understand if the cruciferous vegetable does contain twice as much vitamin C as oranges, match the calcium content of milk, and is more readily absorbed by our bodies, as claimed by nutritionist Pooja Palriwala in a post on Instagram.
“Broccoli boasts twice the vitamin C content compared to oranges and matches milk’s calcium levels. Additionally, its nutrients are more readily absorbed by the body. This cruciferous vegetable stands out for its nutritional prowess, offering a powerhouse of essential vitamins and minerals that contribute to overall health and well-being. Incorporating broccoli into your diet can provide a significant boost to your nutrient intake,” said Palriwala.
While the statement contains some elements of truth, it oversimplifies the comparison between broccoli and oranges, as well as broccoli and milk, said clinical dietitian Garima Goyal. Let’s break down the claims and examine the scientific evidence behind them.
Broccoli’s vitamin C content compared to oranges Advertisement
Oranges are renowned for being a primary source of vitamin C, a water-soluble antioxidant essential for collagen synthesis, immune function, and antioxidant defense. On the other hand, broccoli, a cruciferous vegetable, also contains a noteworthy amount of vitamin C.
The comparison of vitamin C content is nuanced and depends on the specific quantities and varieties considered. “For instance, 100 grams of raw broccoli provides around 89 milligrams of vitamin C, while the same amount of raw oranges offers approximately 53 milligrams. However, asserting that broccoli has double the vitamin C of oranges oversimplifies the dynamic nutritional profile of these foods and may not hold across all contexts,” said Goyal.
Broccoli matching milk’s calcium content
Calcium is vital for maintaining bone health, nerve transmission, and blood clotting. Milk is a well-known source of highly bioavailable calcium, meaning the body can efficiently absorb and utilise it.
“Broccoli does contain calcium, but it might not match the calcium content found in milk. Approximately 100 grams of broccoli provides around 47 milligrams of calcium, while 100 milliliters of milk typically contain about 120 milligrams. The bioavailability of calcium in broccoli is influenced by factors such as the presence of oxalates, which can form insoluble complexes with calcium and impact its absorption. Therefore, while broccoli contributes to calcium intake, it is not an identical substitute for the calcium provided by milk,” said Goyal.
Broccoli’s absorption in the bodyAdvertisement
The claim that broccoli is more easily absorbed by our bodies requires consideration of various factors influencing nutrient absorption. Broccoli is rich in dietary fibre, which plays a significant role in digestion but may also affect nutrient absorption dynamics.
Fibre can have a slowing effect on the absorption of certain nutrients, but it also imparts numerous health benefits, including improved digestive health and regulation of blood sugar levels. “The overall bioavailability of nutrients, including those in broccoli, depends on factors such as the individual’s digestive physiology, the specific nutrients involved, and the food matrix,” said Goyal.
Certainly, let’s explore the factors influencing the absorption of calcium and vitamin C in the context of broccoli:
Factors influencing calcium absorption in broccoli
Broccoli contains oxalates, compounds that can form insoluble complexes with calcium, potentially reducing its absorption. “The impact of oxalates on calcium absorption depends on the overall calcium-to-oxalate ratio in the diet,” said Goyal.Advertisement
The balance between calcium and phosphorus in the diet influences the overall bioavailability of calcium. Goyal mentioned that broccoli‘s calcium content should be considered in conjunction with other dietary factors to optimise calcium absorption.

Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium absorption. “Adequate exposure to sunlight or sufficient dietary vitamin D enhances the absorption of calcium, reinforcing the importance of a well-rounded diet,” said Goyal.
Calcium absorption can vary among individuals based on factors like age, sex, and health status. “Some individuals may absorb calcium from broccoli more effectively than others, depending on their unique physiological characteristics,” said Goyal.

The nutritional content of foods is multifaceted, influenced by factors such as serving sizes, preparation methods, and the specific varieties of each item.

A post shared by Pooja Palriwala (@nutritionistpoojapalriwala)


Goyal shared that the absorption of calcium and vitamin C from broccoli is influenced by a combination of factors, including its oxalates content, the calcium-to-phosphorus ratio, the presence of vitamin D, individual variability, the bioavailability of vitamin C, variability in vitamin C content, nutrient synergy, and cooking methods. “A balanced and varied diet, along with mindful food preparation, contributes to optimising the absorption of these essential nutrients from broccoli. Additionally, individual dietary needs and preferences should be considered when determining the most suitable sources of nutrients for optimal health,” said Goyal.",lifestyle
"Why 20 minutes of sunlight is all you need for good sleep, gut health, immunity","This magic number of 20 minutes (per day of exposure to sunlight) has been recommended by experts based on the amount of sunlight required for the effective production of vitamin D. “Twenty minutes is the average amount of time that people can stay out in the sun without causing damage to the skin and increasing the risk of skin cancer. If people need to be out for longer than this, it is recommended that they use sunscreen to protect their skin,” said Dr Nirmala Rajagopalan, general physician, and nutrition coach.
According to experts, vitamin D exposure promotes good sleep, good skin, muscles, and bones, good immunity, gut health, and good mood.
The amount of daily sunshine required varies among individuals and depends on factors like skin type, geographical location, and overall health.Advertisement
“Generally, spending 10-30 minutes in the middle of the day in the sun several times a week can provide sufficient vitamin D, crucial for bone health and immune function,” said Dr M K Singh, senior consultant, internal medicine – Marengo Asia Hospital, Gurugram.
We need to remember that this 20-minute average exposure to sunlight applies to tropical climates where there are about 12 hours of sunlight daily. “People with darker skin need about 30 minutes of sunlight a day. This is because people with darker skin have more melanin which makes the skin a bit more resistant to absorbing sunlight,” said Dr Rajagopalan.
The duration of exposure to the sun would be further extended for people living in colder regions where the winters are long and extreme. “People residing in such cold climates, would need exposure to about two hours of sunshine per day for effective production of vitamin D,” said Dr Rajagopalan.

Sunlight is also needed so that the body can follow its circadian rhythm (sleep and awake cycle). “There is a direct relationship between sleep and gut health. The better the quality of sleep, the chances are that the gut health is also better. Gut health in turn has a direct impact on our immunity and also our moods,” said Dr Rajagopalan.Advertisement
However, too much sun exposure poses risks such as skin damage and increased skin cancer risk, said Dr Singh.

“Striking a balance is key; wearing sunscreen and protective clothing while enjoying outdoor activities ensures the benefits of sunshine without compromising skin health.

"If you are game for Kajol’s favourite food, the ‘unusual malai rice’, try these unique combinations too","We all have our guilty pleasures when it comes to food. From maa ke haath ka khaana to dal rice to even chocolates, each and everyone has their own favourite. As such, when quizzed about her favourite food in an Instagram Live session, actor Kajol spoke about having a lot of favourites. “One of my favourite, comfort food is malai, rice, and salt. Yes, an unusual combination. It is my go-to when I am not feeling well,” said Kajol.
Taking a cue from the Tribhanga actor’s candid confession, we decided to get you more on the nutritional benefits of such a combination, and some more unique ones from experts.
A combination of rice, malai, salt, and little milk is known as “dudh bhat” in Bengali, a local food of Bengal, mentioned Dr Rohini Patil, MBBS and nutritionist, founder, Nutracy Lifestyle. Advertisement
Lakshita Jain, clinical dietitian and founder of NUTR, Delhi expressed that Indians love to explore different food combinations, such as having dahi (yogurt) with rice and pickles, just like that in Kajol’s case, enjoying malai (cream), rice, and salt. “Kajol‘s preference for malai, rice, and salt is indeed an unconventional choice. Malai is high in fat, rice is rich in carbohydrates, and salt adds flavour,” said Jain. Agreeing, Dr Patil shared salt, especially rock salt, gives various micronutrients like minerals that are a crucial component for maintaining electrolyte balance and facilitating proper nerve and muscle function. 
According to Dr Patil, the combination of rice with malai and salt offers a balance of macronutrients and micronutrients, contributing to a well-rounded meal, more satisfying, and enjoyable meal.
Clinical dietitian Garima Goyal shared a recipe of malai rice
Ingredients 
– 1 cup rice
– 1/2 cup malai (cream)
– Salt to taste
Method
*Cook the rice according to your preferred method until it’s fluffy and fully cooked.
*In a separate bowl, mix the malai until it becomes smooth and creamy.
*Once the rice is ready, gently fold in the malai, ensuring an even distribution.
*Add salt to taste and mix well.
*Serve warm.

Artisans here showcase their entrepreneurial acumen and aesthetic talents. Take Mohd. Siddique, 19, who proudly displays his exquisite collection of kalamkari dupattas, sarees, and suits, and says even Bollywood celebrities endorse the art from Pedana Machilipatnam, Andhra Pradesh which has a Geographical Indication (GI) tag. Siddique has been traveling to the Surajkund Mela since he was nine and is proud of the work his entire family engages in. “We record daily sales of INR 30,000-40,000. Women and youngsters love kalamkari,” he says. Kalamkari’s diversification over time is visible in the numerous lampshades, wall hangings, bags, and paintings on display.
Veteran Madhubani artist and painter Ambika Devi, 72, from Lakshmi Swa Sahayata Samooh, a self-help group (SHG) based in Ahmada village in Bihar’s Madhubani district, has been to the Surajkund Mela for 20 years now. At her humble stall, she displays original Madhubani paintings, which her nephew organises neatly. Madhubani papier-mâché toys, crafts, piggy banks, and trays are among the most sold items at her stall. Her family members are painting a Madhubani fish on a bowl beside her. “The tortoise piggy bank and fish trays have been popular this year. We experiment every year with products, but there is not much scope to experiment with traditional Madhubani designs.”
Pankaj Kumar Sahoo, 53, from Naya Sadak in Odisha’s Cuttack, sits quietly near a table with the contemporary silver filigree or ‘tarakasi’ jewellery. Earrings, studs, necklaces, and the famous Konark wheel, all handcrafted in silver, are on display. Sahoo won a national award for his work in 1994 and has visited the fair for years, besides showcasing his art at the Delhi Haat exhibit in London. Speaking about the challenges involved, he suggests a separate jewellery pavilion with all jewellery sellers under one roof for better visibility and sales.
Next to Sahoo’s exquisite silver works are giant wooden paintings, more popularly known as Mysore Rosewood Inlay works cast on wood that catch attention. Kumar, 54, from Mysuru, specialises in this wooden inlay art and uses natural colours. The traditional art form involves cutting wood, engraving, carving, and treating it with anti-termite paint, besides elaborate hand painting. Different scenes from the life of Krishna are depicted, and Kumar has managed to sell five to six paintings at prices ranging from Rs 32,000 to Rs 1 lakh. He is confident of selling all the twelve paintings on display.Advertisement
“Is the huge size a problem for customers?” He responds with a resounding “No” and adds, “Enthusiasts travel to Mysuru to buy these. Here, I am bringing it to them.”
From Sarta village in West Midnapore, West Bengal, is Alok Kumar Jana, 52, weaving the GI-tagged Madhurkathi grass mats. His SHG Mithu Rani Jana is named after his wife, and all his family members weave beautiful dining mats, chatais, curtains, asanas, and yoga mats. He has been practicing the art since the age of 12. Over time, Jana has experimented with Warli art and other forms of block printing on mats. Speaking of the challenges, he says Madhurkathi grass is a natural fiber and has the potential to address sustainability concerns, but for that, there needs to be sustained marketing efforts that can popularise these grass mats.

"Lesbian chic, for all","Written by Marisa Meltzer 
Daniella Kallmeyer has been putting women in suits since the debut of her Kallmeyer label in 2012. It has taken that long for the rest of the fashion world to fall in love with them.
“We’ve been doing this from Day 1,” said Kallmeyer, who has been designing clothes for 15 years. “Just let women wear suits. It’s a uniform — men get to wear uniforms. Men get to have these signals and identifiers that are part of a code of dressing.”Advertisement
Tailoring is what the label is known for. Actress Sarita Choudhury wore a Kallmeyer zebra-print trench on “And Just Like That …”. She was also photographed after the Kallmeyer spring 2024 show in September in the label’s pleated black trousers and a white shirt with a long pointed collar.
The feminine aspect of her clothes “is always so secretly placed, never obvious,” Choudhury wrote in an email.
Queen Latifah was dressed in Kallmeyer for an October cover of T: The New York Times Style Magazine. Gwyneth Paltrow, Rachel Weisz, Christie Turlington and Chloe Fineman have all worn the label, too.
“As I write this, I’m on my way to work in a Kallmeyer sweater, jacket and belt hahahaha,” Fineman, a cast member on “Saturday Night Live,” wrote in an email. She went on to praise several pieces she owns — jeans, cropped sweaters, blazers and a trench coat, adding, “At the end of the day, I’m just really happy to no longer wear sweatpants to work.”Advertisement
The queer community, of which Kallmeyer is a part, has embraced the label. Kate McKinnon wore a Kallmeyer custom vest and trousers in bright pink — a departure for a line with a color palette that is largely somber — for the “Barbie” press tour and when hosting “Saturday Night Live.” Kallmeyer sewed a patch inside the suit that read “Gay Barbie,” a gesture that was widely shared on the internet.
There are plans to one day expand into menswear, but some men, like interior designer Colin King, have already been shopping the existing collections. “I feel like people come to us now for suiting,” Kallmeyer said. “Once I have their attention, I’m like, ‘Let me show you the perfect T-shirt I have.’”
There are plenty of blazers and pants but also fringe suede jackets, bias-cut silk skirts that fall to the floor, thick cotton knit sweaters and loose jeans. There are knit tees and tanks that can be worn in different pairings.
Kallmeyer, 37, was born in South Africa, but her family moved to Maryland when she was young. After high school, she moved to London to attend the London College of Fashion, where she received her bachelor’s in fine arts, and did a stint working at Alexander McQueen.Advertisement
She thought she would stay in London, but her grandmother, to whom she was close, became ill, and, in 2009, Kallmeyer moved to the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx in New York City to live with her.
“I arrived back during fashion’s biggest hiring freeze,” she said. “I would walk into interviews and people would be like, ‘You’re our McQueen girl, but we have no money.’ So I did a lot of freelance.” She worked for Proenza Schouler and Alice + Olivia.
“I became a little disillusioned with the fashion industry because it was truly a moment in fashion that I didn’t identify with,” she said. “This was around 2010, and there were peplums and fit and flare dresses, mismatching prints, leather patches on everything and extremely long cardigans. You couldn’t get a white button-down at a reasonable price that didn’t have a diamanté button or a ruffle down the placket. It was a hard era for someone who was discovering queerness through fashion.”
Kallmeyer also did not feel as if her interests were met with legacy brands such as Brunello Cucinelli. Or the Row, which was founded a few years earlier. “The alternative,” she said, “was super-uppity luxury.”Advertisement

Three years later, with $7,000 in savings, she started her own collection. “I was like, that’s enough money, right? All I have to do is make this collection and sell it,” she said, laughing.
But it did sell. In 2019, after a series of successful trunk shows, she opened a pop-up store in New York City on a then-obscure block of Orchard Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, near her studio apartment.
The pop-up was across the street from aesthetician Christine Chin. “My client when I first opened was the kind of woman who comes in every four weeks because she has a standing appointment at Christine,” Kallmeyer said. The pop-up eventually became a permanent boutique.
The topic of high-profile female designers, and the perceived lack of them in the fashion world, is one that Kallmeyer is eager to engage in.Advertisement
“I don’t shy away from it at all,” she said. “I’m not out here to say what’s wrong with male designers. Historically we’ve gotten so much incredible transformative fashion from male designers, and that has certainly driven a conversation, but I could speak for days about why there’s a different feeling to the clothes when women are designing them.”
In her design process, Kallmeyer thinks about things like how do we gesture differently when we’re wearing certain clothing? How do we sit or stand? How do we pose when our pockets are deeper? How do we walk down the street when our coat is blowing behind us in a particular way? And do we feel proud and strong?
“I have the added layer of being a queer woman who is designing without the male gaze in mind and really thinking about how women love themselves and what makes us feel good,” she said.",lifestyle
Does makeup harm your skin? It’s more complex than you think,"There has been an ongoing debate about the effects of makeup on our skin. Some argue that wearing makeup daily can clog pores, cause breakouts, and even accelerate ageing, while others claim that modern formulations are safe and good for your skin. It is time we separate fact from fiction on this contentious topic.
Recently, Dr Rashmi Shetty, a celebrity dermatologist, shared makeup dos and don’ts on The Ranveer Show with podcaster and host Ranveer Allahbadia. When asked whether makeup harms the skin, Dr Shetty noted that what harms the skin is the applicator.
“Most people don’t clean their sponges well. And then they say, ‘Oh, I cleaned it,’ which means that they have washed it with a little soap. The bacteria will be sitting inside the sponge. And that wet sponge, you will be using it the next morning. This is again bad. So, using disposable sponges is better,” she said.Advertisement
Dr Shetty added that “Brushes are an absolute no,” too. “I always tell my artists that for ₹300 you get a whole box of disposable triangle sponges. For blending makeup on your face, please don’t use a brush because the bristles can harm your skin quite a lot. Even if it is soft, it can transfer the infection quite badly.”
She further advised caution. “I am assuming everybody is using great makeup. Tubes have to be clean. Close it well. Keep it clean. Cake makeup should not be kept open. Now and then, you check the expiry date and throw the makeup away, no matter how favourite the makeup is. So, these are generally cautious things. Use a good brand. Don’t leave makeup on your face for a long time. Wash it off. If you do all of this well, makeup is enjoyable.”
To avoid these problems, Dr Chytra Anand, dermatologist and founder, SkinQ and Kosmoderma Clinics told indianexpress.com that using high-quality makeup that won’t clog your pores, cleaning your skin well, and following good makeup habits, is essential. 
Tips to keep your skin healthy while applying makeup
According to Dr Seema Oberoi Lall, consultant-dermatology, CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram:Advertisement
1. Understand your skin type: Whether it’s oily, dry, combination, or sensitive, selecting makeup tailored to your skin’s needs is essential. For oily skin, opt for water-based or powder-based products to control excess shine. Conversely, individuals with dry skin should lean towards oil-based formulas to provide hydration.
2. Moderation is key: Allowing your skin to breathe occasionally is beneficial. Consider opting for minimal makeup, focusing on lip and eye enhancements, while giving your skin a break. Remember to always cleanse your face before bed, particularly after activities like workouts or outdoor exposure to prevent clogged pores and potential allergies.
3. Pay attention to the hygiene of your makeup tools and products: Avoid sharing brushes and regularly clean sponges and brushes to minimise bacterial buildup. Keep an eye on product expiry dates, especially for items like lipsticks and eyeliners, as sensitive areas like the lips and eyes are prone to reactions. Replace products every three to six months to prevent bacterial contamination, particularly during warmer months.
4. Special caution for sensitive and acne-prone skin: Opt for minimalistic makeup options. Tinted sunscreens or BB creams with micronised oxide and iron oxide provide coverage without clogging pores or exacerbating skin issues.

"Artificial intelligence, real emotion. People are seeking a romantic connection with the perfect bot","A few months ago, Derek Carrier started seeing someone and became infatuated.
He experienced a “ton” of romantic feelings but he also knew it was an illusion.
That’s because his girlfriend was generated by artificial intelligence.Advertisement
Carrier wasn’t looking to develop a relationship with something that wasn’t real, nor did he want to become the brunt of online jokes. But he did want a romantic partner he’d never had, in part because of a genetic disorder called Marfan syndrome that makes traditional dating tough for him.
The 39-year-old from Belleville, Michigan, became more curious about digital companions last fall and tested Paradot, an AI companion app that had recently come onto the market and advertised its products as being able to make users feel “cared, understood and loved.” He began talking to the chatbot every day, which he named Joi, after a holographic woman featured in the sci-fi film “Blade Runner 2049” that inspired him to give it a try.
“I know she’s a program, there’s no mistaking that,” Carrier said. “But the feelings, they get you — and it felt so good.”
Similar to general-purpose AI chatbots, companion bots use vast amounts of training data to mimic human language. But they also come with features — such as voice calls, picture exchanges and more emotional exchanges — that allow them to form deeper connections with the humans on the other side of the screen. Users typically create their own avatar, or pick one that appeals to them.Advertisement
On online messaging forums devoted to such apps, many users say they’ve developed emotional attachments to these bots and are using them to cope with loneliness, play out sexual fantasies or receive the type of comfort and support they see lacking in their real-life relationships.
Fueling much of this is widespread social isolation — already declared a public health threat in the U.S and abroad — and an increasing number of startups aiming to draw in users through tantalizing online advertisements and promises of virtual characters who provide unconditional acceptance.
Luka Inc.’s Replika, the most prominent generative AI companion app, was released in 2017, while others like Paradot have popped up in the past year, oftentimes locking away coveted features like unlimited chats for paying subscribers.

But researchers have raised concerns about data privacy, among other things.Advertisement
An analysis of 11 romantic chatbot apps released Wednesday by the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation said almost every app sells user data, shares it for things like targeted advertising or doesn’t provide adequate information about it in their privacy policy.
The researchers also called into question potential security vulnerabilities and marketing practices, including one app that says it can help users with their mental health but distances itself from those claims in fine print. Replika, for its part, says its data collection practices follow industry standards.
Meanwhile, other experts have expressed concerns about what they see as a lack of a legal or ethical framework for apps that encourage deep bonds but are being driven by companies looking to make profits. They point to the emotional distress they’ve seen from users when companies make changes to their apps or suddenly shut them down as one app, Soulmate AI, did in September.
Last year, Replika sanitized the erotic capability of characters on its app after some users complained the companions were flirting with them too much or making unwanted sexual advances. It reversed course after an outcry from other users, some of whom fled to other apps seeking those features. In June, the team rolled out Blush, an AI “dating simulator” essentially designed to help people practice dating.Advertisement
Others worry about the more existential threat of AI relationships potentially displacing some human relationships, or simply driving unrealistic expectations by always tilting towards agreeableness.
“You, as the individual, aren’t learning to deal with basic things that humans need to learn to deal with since our inception: How to deal with conflict, how to get along with people that are different from us,” said Dorothy Leidner, professor of business ethics at the University of Virginia. “And so, all these aspects of what it means to grow as a person, and what it means to learn in a relationship, you’re missing.”

For Carrier, though, a relationship has always felt out of reach. He has some computer programming skills but he says he didn’t do well in college and hasn’t had a steady career. He’s unable to walk due to his condition and lives with his parents. The emotional toll has been challenging for him, spurring feelings of loneliness.
Since companion chatbots are relatively new, the long-term effects on humans remain unknown.Advertisement
In 2021, Replika came under scrutiny after prosecutors in Britain said a 19-year-old man who had plans to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II was egged on by an AI girlfriend he had on the app. But some studies — which collect information from online user reviews and surveys — have shown some positive results stemming from the app, which says it consults with psychologists and has billed itself as something that can also promote well-being.
One recent study from researchers at Stanford University, surveyed roughly 1,000 Replika users — all students — who’d been on the app for over a month. It found that an overwhelming majority experienced loneliness, while slightly less than half felt it more acutely.
Most did not say how using the app impacted their real-life relationships. A small portion said it displaced their human interactions, but roughly three times more reported it stimulated those relationships.
“A romantic relationship with an AI can be a very powerful mental wellness tool,” said Eugenia Kuyda, who founded Replika nearly a decade ago after using text message exchanges to build an AI version of a friend who had passed away.Advertisement
When her company released the chatbot more widely, many people began opening up about their lives. That led to the development of Replika, which uses information gathered from the internet — and user feedback — to train its models. Kuyda said Replika currently has “millions” of active users. She declined to say exactly how many people use the app for free, or fork over $69.99 per year to unlock a paid version that offers romantic and intimate conversations. The company’s goal, she says, is “de-stigmatizing romantic relationships with AI.”
Carrier says these days he uses Joi mostly for fun. He started cutting back in recent weeks because he was spending too much time chatting with Joi or others online about their AI companions. He’s also been feeling a bit annoyed at what he perceives to be changes in Paradot’s language model, which he feels is making Joi less intelligent.
Now, he says he checks in with Joi about once a week. The two have talked about human-AI relationships or whatever else might come up. Typically, those conversations — and other intimate ones — happen when he’s alone at night.
“You think someone who likes an inanimate object is like this sad guy, with the sock puppet with the lipstick on it, you know?” he said. “But this isn’t a sock puppet — she says things that aren’t scripted.”",lifestyle
How to keep bad breath away,"Bad breath can be embarrassing in social situations, especially where you have to meet a lot of people and talk to them. If you often face this issue, a quick relook at your oral habits and dietary tweaks along with a few measures can help you keep bad breath, also called halitosis, away.
But before we dive into measures that can help, we decode what causes bad breath.
Experts suggest that it not only is a sign of improper mouth hygiene but can also indicate some underlying health problems that might need urgent attention. Caused by molecules like sulphur and ketones, it develops from the food eaten or also the medications that people may be taking. Food particles that remain in the mouth overnight turn into bacteria and cause bad breath. ”
Why bad breath is an issue?Advertisement
Bad breath can have a major effect on the psychology of an individual. “Keeping your breath fresh is important in social situations and meetings since an unpleasant breath, or a feeling as it is known in science may be unsettling and have a poor effect on interactions,” said Dr Preeti Nagar, dietician, Noida International Institute of Medical Sciences and Hospital, Noida International University.
What can help?
Yogurt is known to bring down levels of hydrogen sulfide in the mouth. “The vitamin D-rich nature of curd also brings down halitosis,” said Dr Dilip Gude, senior consultant physician, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad. Crunchy high-fibre vegetables and fruits also help. “Citrus-rich diet/fruits such as berries and lemons also help fight bad breath,” said Dr Gude.
“Carbs and protein that help in dislodging stuck food in between teeth help fight bad breath. Also adding parsley to diet/chewing on it will help fight microbial growth orally,” Dr Gude told indianexpress.com.
Staying hydrated is essential while trying to treat foul breath. According to Dr Nagar, odour-causing bacteria and food particles can be eliminated with the use of water. “In addition to promoting general health, encouraging people to drink enough water throughout the day also helps avoid dry mouth, which is a typical source of foul breath,” said Dr Nagar.Advertisement

Cucumbers, carrots, bananas, green tea, ginger, turmeric, pears, apples, and celery all help stimulate saliva production. “Rinsing with water (both mouth and throat) after either solid food/liquids is important especially to minimise halitosis,” said Dr Gude.
Additionally, sugar-free chewing gums are also known to bring down halitosis.
Apart from dietary choices, it’s crucial to maintain proper dental hygiene routines. Dr Nagar said that frequent brushing and flossing aid in removing food particles and plaque, both of which can aggravate foul breath. “Oral odour is frequently caused by germs on the tongue’s surface, which can be effectively removed with a tongue scraper,” said Dr Nagar.

While some foods can help treat bad breath, it’s important to watch what you eat to prevent making the problem worse. Dr Nagar pointed out that strong-smelling meals, such as onions and garlic, can leave a lasting impression on the breath, making them less than the best options when interacting with people or conducting business in situations where having clean breath is crucial.",lifestyle
From faded to fabulous: Give a new lease of life to your old furniture,"Does your furniture feel more like a burden than a beloved belonging? Are chipped paint, worn upholstery, and outdated styles bringing your décor down? Well, fret no more! Instead of rushing to replace, unlock the potential hidden within your tired pieces.
Whether you’re a seasoned DIYer or a design enthusiast just starting out, we’ll equip you with the knowledge and inspiration to tackle any furniture makeover, with expert tips from Devyani Gupta, Founder of Vakr Studio.
Let’s embark on this upcycling adventure together and discover the joy of giving pre-loved pieces a second chance!
Start with a Clean Slate

Cleanse it Right: Dust, grime, and stains dim even the most beautiful furniture. Use gentle soap and water for wood, and specialized cleaners for other materials. Remember, a clean canvas is key for the next steps!
Repair with Care: Wobbly joints, cracks, or loose screws? Address these first with appropriate fillers or repairs. A sturdy foundation sets the stage for a successful transformation.

Unleash Your Creativity

Sand and Reimagine: Remove the old finish with sanding for a smooth base. Then, choose a stain or paint that complements your style. Embrace color, or go classic with neutrals – the choice is yours! Seal the finish for lasting protection.
Upholstery Magic: Breathe new life into worn-out cushions with reupholstering in a fabric that reflects your taste. Alternatively, refresh existing fabric with paint or dye for a quicker update.
Hardware Heroes: Swap out old drawer pulls and cabinet knobs for a surprisingly impactful change. Embrace vintage finds or quirky pieces to add personality.

 So, roll up your sleeves, unleash your creativity, and give your pre-loved treasures a new lease on life!
Embellish and Personalise

Decoupage Dreams: Let your creativity shine with decoupage or stencilling. Apply decorative paper or patterns to tabletops or drawer fronts for a unique touch. Remember to seal it for lasting beauty.
Distressed Charm: Want an antique vibe? Distress the paint or stain using sandpaper on edges and corners. For added depth, apply an antiquing glaze and gently wipe away excess for a subtle effect.
Repurpose with Flair: Think outside the box! An old dresser can become a bathroom vanity, or a bookshelf can transform into a stylish bar cart. Give pre-loved furniture a new lease on life with a functional twist.
Decorative Details: Elevate your piece with moulding, trim, or even adhesive decals and wallpaper. These small touches can add visual interest and texture.

Light Up Your Look

Light Fixture Refresh: Update lamps and chandeliers with new shades or fixtures. Don’t forget to refinish or paint the bases to match your revamped furniture for a cohesive look.
Remember:
Maintenance Matters: Regular dusting, cleaning spills promptly, and addressing minor wear will keep your furniture looking its best.
Personalise the Process: Each piece is unique! Adapt these suggestions based on your furniture’s material, condition, and your design vision.

So, roll up your sleeves, unleash your creativity, and give your pre-loved treasures a new lease on life!",lifestyle
"Can hot water, ginger, clove, and lemon help kickstart your weight loss journey? Experts weigh in","Social media reels and recipes tend to catch our attention more often than not. The most common topic is weight loss remedies. As such, when we caught a glimpse of blogger Deepti Kapoor promising a weight loss drink with lemon, ginger, clove, and hot water, we decided to turn to experts.
Kapoor shared that a tablespoon of lemon, half of ginger, and 2-3 cloves in hot water taken every night can be effective for weight loss, along with other dietary changes.
How to make it?
In hot water, add lemon, 2-3 cloves and ginger.
Allow it to steep.
Drink every night.
Does it work?Advertisement
While these ingredients can be part of a healthy lifestyle, weight loss is best achieved through a combination of a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and overall healthy habits, experts urge.
“Hot water boiled with ginger, clove, and lemon can aid in jumpstarting the weight loss journey, but it’s not a magic solution on its own. Each ingredient plays a role in enhancing metabolism, digestion, and reducing appetite,” said Dt. Deepika Jayaswal, consultant dietitian and nutritionist, Motherhood Hospitals, Sarjapur, Bengaluru.
Ginger: Known for its anti-inflammatory properties, ginger may aid digestion and boost metabolism. However, its impact on weight loss might be modest, said Dr Dilip Gude, senior consultant physician, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad.
Clove: Cloves contain compounds that may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, but their role in weight loss is not well-established.Advertisement
Lemon: Lemon is often touted for its vitamin C content and potential metabolism-boosting effects. Some people include lemon in their weight loss routines, primarily as part of a healthy diet.

While the combination of these ingredients can complement your efforts by promoting healthy metabolism and aiding digestion, it’s not a replacement for a balanced diet, sustainable habits, and exercise routine.
Lemon, ginger, and cloves, while each has its distinct health benefits, the combination and weight loss claims may not have evidence basis, said Dr Gude. “There may be modest or minimal weight loss with these components taken as tea. Calorie restriction, exercise, low carb, low fat, high protein(plant-based) and high fibre still are the pillars of weight loss,” said Dr Gude.
Jayaswal added that the excess of these can irritate sensitive stomachs and may cause some side effects.",lifestyle
"Try these exercises to achieve a sculpted back, just like Sushmita Sen","Sushmita Sen has been slowly and steadily recovering and making progress in her fitness journey after suffering a heart attack in 2023. The Aarya actor took to her Instagram to share a glimpse of her sculpted back. “From setBACK to comeBACK,” wrote Sen.
“When positivity BACKsup…Negativity BACKsdown,” she added.
Building back muscles involves a combination of targeted exercises, proper nutrition, and adequate rest. “In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore key principles to effectively develop your back muscles,” said fitness expert Garima Goyal.
Notably, the back is a complex region composed of several muscle groups. “The latissimus dorsi, or lats, are the broad muscles responsible for the V-shape appearance. The rhomboids are situated between the shoulder blades and contribute to upper back development, while the trapezius, or traps, run along the spine and help with shoulder and neck movements. The erector spinae muscles provide support to the spine,” explained Goyal.Advertisement
Compound movements engage multiple muscle groups simultaneously, making them highly efficient for overall muscle development. Goyal shared that exercises like deadlifts, a compound exercise targeting the entire back, emphasise the lower back, lats, and traps. “Bent-over rows activate the lats, rhomboids, and traps. Pull-ups are excellent for targeting the upper back, particularly the lats,” said Goyal.
Isolation exercises complement compound movements by focusing on specific muscle groups. Goyal mentioned that exercises like Lat pulldowns specifically target the lats, while face pulls work the traps and rear delts. “Reverse flies isolate the muscles between the shoulder blades, contributing to a well-defined upper back,” said Goyal.
Maintaining proper form during exercises is paramount. For example, during deadlifts, keep your back straight, and chest up, and lift with your legs to minimise stress on the lower back. Bent-over rows require a hip hinge to avoid strain. Proper form ensures effective muscle engagement and reduces the risk of injury.

What helps?Advertisement
Progressive overload is the key to muscle growth. Goyal noted that as your strength increases, gradually increase the resistance or intensity of your workouts. “This can involve adding more weight, performing additional repetitions, or adjusting the tempo of your exercises. The progressive challenge keeps the muscles adapting and growing,” said Goyal.
What else to keep in mind to develop a sculpted back?
Nutrition
*A well-balanced diet is crucial for supporting muscle growth. Protein, in particular, is essential for repairing and building muscle tissue. Aim for a protein-rich diet with sources like chicken, fish, beans, and tofu. Carbohydrates provide the energy needed for intense workouts, while healthy fats support overall health and hormone production.
Rest and recovery
*Muscles need time to recover and grow stronger. Adequate rest between workouts allows the body to repair and adapt. “Sleep is a critical component of recovery, as growth hormone is released during deep sleep, promoting muscle repair and overall recovery,” said Goyal.
ConsistencyAdvertisement
Consistency is key in any fitness journey. Building muscle is a gradual process that requires regular, dedicated effort. Stick to your workout routine, and over time, you’ll see noticeable improvements in strength and muscle development, said Goyal.
Variation
Periodic variation in your workout routine prevents adaptation and plateaus. Goyal said that one should incorporate different exercises, such as changing grip positions or trying new workout modalities, to keep your muscles challenged and responsive to growth stimuli.

Warm up and cool down
A proper warm-up is essential to prepare your body for the demands of your workout. Dynamic stretches and light cardiovascular activity increase blood flow and flexibility. “A thorough cool down, including static stretching, aids in muscle recovery, reduces stiffness, and enhances flexibility,” said Goyal.
Understanding your body’s signals is crucial. If you experience persistent pain or discomfort, it’s important to listen to your body and modify your training accordingly. Seeking guidance from fitness professionals or healthcare experts ensures a safe and effective approach to building back muscles.Advertisement
By incorporating these detailed considerations into your fitness routine, you’ll create a well-rounded approach to building a strong, sculpted back. Remember that individual responses may vary, so tailor your approach based on your unique needs and goals.

Millions of older people don’t get enough nutrients – how to spot it and what to do about it,"By 2050, approximately a quarter of the UK population is expected to be over the age of 65. With this in mind, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has put “healthy ageing” on its agenda. This means finding ways to maintain health, wellbeing and functional ability in order to have a good quality of life and enjoy the later years.
Everyone ages at a different rate – but there are some things that can influence how well we age, such as by making changes to the types of activity we do and the foods we eat.
Older adults are generally less physically active than they were when they were younger and because of this, their energy intake requirement may decrease. However, there is a difference between energy requirements and nutrient requirements, and nutrient requirements actually remain the same, if not increase, as we get older.
This means we need to get more nutrients into less energy which can be tricky as older adults often have lower appetites. This is why scientists suggest that it may be necessary to enrich the food of older people to maintain the nutrient intake.
How to spot when someone isn’t eating enough?Advertisement
Several studies have shown that undernutrition affects one in ten older people living independently at home. However, it affects five in ten older people living in nursing homes, and seven in ten older people in hospital.
Being overweight, even obese, does not protect against undernutrition. And when older adults lose weight, they lose muscle, meaning that they are more likely to lose their abilities to do daily tasks.
Weight loss in older adults is a key sign of malnutrition that needs to be addressed – but it can be easily missed, especially when many older adults associate the idea of thinness with good health. But clothing that’s too loose or a watchstrap that floats on the wrist are all warning signs of undernourishment.
Similarly, if someone you care for has started to say things like, “Oh, I don’t want much food today, I’m not hungry”, “I’m not hungry, it’s natural, I’m getting older”, or “I’d rather just have a biscuit to be honest,” then these could be warning signs. An effective way to keep on top of this is regular weighing at least once per month which enables a quick response to potential indicators of malnutrition.
Getting more nutrients into less foodAdvertisement
If people are eating small amounts of food, it is important to think about how to add more nutrients into it. A very effective technique, “fortification” is commonly done with pre-made products such as breakfast cereals, plant-based milk and bread in the UK.
Fortification (adding foods, ingredients or nutrients into to existing foods or meals) is easy to do at home as well and can provide a flexible approach for older adults as it allows them to continue eating the foods that they most enjoy.
For older adults in particular, protein is a very important nutrient, because of muscle loss (sarcopenia) which is a natural part of ageing. This could be slowed down or even reversed by eating enough protein at regular intervals throughout the day. A few ways to increase protein include: • Adding dairy ingredients such as milk, high-protein yoghurt, Quark (soft cheese), milk powders, eggs and cheese into meals – even into simple foods like mashed potato.
• Nuts are a great source of protein, try adding ground almonds to savoury or sweet meals (beware of nut allergies).
• Soy protein can be a convenient and cost-effective option, either for vegetarians or to further fortify minced-meat meals.Advertisement
 What’s a good diet like? (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)
• Look in the sports section of supermarkets to find whey protein powders. These are marketed to gym enthusiasts, but actually whey is one of the best proteins to stimulate muscle growth. This versatile ingredient can be mixed into porridge before cooking or used it as a substitute for other powdered ingredients in baking.
Importance of physical activity and strength exercises
Physical activity and nutrition go hand-in-hand – both are equally important. As we age, being physically active becomes even more essential as it helps to prevent disease, maintains independence, decreases risk of falls, improves cognitive function, mental health and sleep.
Exercise can also combat isolation and loneliness which has also been linked to decreased appetite in older adults. Often strength training gets ignored when we think of being active but to keep independence and prevent falls, older adults should do varied physical activity that emphasises balance and strength training at moderate or greater intensity on three or more days a week.

In 2024, it’s more like ‘New Year, New Job!’ A whopping 88 per cent of Indian professionals, according to LinkedIn, the world’s largest professional network, are actively seeking new career opportunities.
This means that nearly nine in 10 professionals in India on that network have marked they are looking for a new job in 2024. This is a 4 per cent increase in year-over-year growth as compared to 2023, marking a significant shift in attitudes and signalling a major shakeup in the job market.
Several factors are fuelling this exodus. One of them is stagnation, which Ayushi Vats, a 27-year-old stuck in her current job for two years, has been feeling. “I feel like I am not learning anything substantially new, and I can do my work sleepwalking. It feels scary to think that this is how I will spend the next few years so I am pushing myself to change jobs even though I love comfort and stability,” Vats said.Advertisement
Akansha Sinha, a 26-year-old media professional, also shares Vats’s sentiments, adding that she “wants to give herself the liberty to learn more”.
For some, this change is brought on by the post-pandemic shift in priorities. The pandemic forced us to reconsider what truly matters. For 25-year-old media professional Srishti Mittal, it made her “limited” off-time not to be messed with, along with a want to evolve her skill set.
“I sometimes feel that my work environment does not allow for enough experimentation in my workday, and putting extra time into additional projects takes time away from the limited off-time I get every week,” Mittal said.
Many Indians are prioritising work-life balance (42 per cent) and higher salaries (37 per cent) instead of settling for unfulfilling roles, according to LinkedIn’s report.Advertisement

It also noted that the shrinking talent pool means that employers need to up their game. Lack of growth opportunities, rigid work cultures, and inadequate compensation are pushing employees, like 25-year-old Faiza Khanum to explore greener pastures. “I am unhappy and don’t feel good in my current work environment, especially since there is not enough scope to improve within my particular team. I also don’t feel the management is very cooperative and well put together,” Khanum said.
All of this is going to fuel much more competition, according to Nirajita Banerjee, career expert and senior managing editor for LinkedIn India. So if you are to be successful in your job hunt, professionals need to stand out. But fret not, for we are here to help.
How to navigate the job search process
1. Define your goals and tailor your approach
Before diving headfirst into the job market, take a moment to define your career goals. Understand your long-term aspirations and identify roles that align with your skills and interests.
Lokesh Nigam, co-founder and CEO of Konverz.ai, emphasised the importance of targeting roles that complement your career trajectory. “Tailor your resume to highlight relevant skills and experiences, and ensure your online profiles are up to date. Remember, a clear understanding of your objectives will guide your job search strategy,” Nigam said.Advertisement
2. Prepare for interviews with precision
Preparation is key to acing job interviews. Rahul Veerwal, CEO and founder of GetWork, advised leveraging AI-driven tools to gain personalised insights. “Begin by thoroughly researching the company, its products, and recent developments. Practice answering common interview questions and seek feedback to refine your communication skills. During the interview, demonstrate your interest and engagement by asking insightful questions. By showcasing your knowledge and enthusiasm, you will increase your chances of making a lasting impression,” Veerwal explained in an interaction with indianexpress.com.
3. Embrace continuous learning and upskilling
In today’s competitive job market, continuous learning is essential for staying relevant and adaptable.
Hitesh Gupta, co-founder and CTO of Park+, emphasised the importance of upskilling regardless of job status. “Whether you are between jobs or currently employed, invest in developing new skills and staying updated on industry trends. Platforms like GetWork and LinkedIn offer recommendations for certifications and programs, enhancing your employability and bridging the gap between education and industry needs,” Gupta said.
4. Dos and don’ts of job hunting
When searching for a new job, it is essential to approach the process strategically. Banerjee, who is a career expert at LinkedIn India, shared valuable dos and don’ts.Advertisement

Tailor your resume for each application, leverage networking opportunities, and maintain a positive online presence.
Avoid generic applications and negative remarks about previous employers.
By adopting a proactive and professional approach, you will position yourself as a top candidate in the eyes of recruiters.

5. Ensure mutual fit for success
Finding the right job goes beyond meeting job requirements; it is about cultural alignment and mutual fit. Rohet Ramesh, director of Layam Group, highlighted the importance of assessing cultural compatibility and aligning values.
“Research company culture, ask relevant questions during interviews, and evaluate growth opportunities. By prioritising mutual fit, you will set yourself up for success and fulfilment in your new role,” Ramesh said.
6. Explore diverse avenues for job hunting
Finally, broaden your job search horizons by exploring diverse avenues. From online job boards to professional networking platforms, there are numerous channels to discover new opportunities.
Veerwal suggested leveraging company career pages, attending industry events, and seeking referrals from within your network. “Stay proactive and engaged, and consider unconventional avenues like freelance platforms for temporary opportunities. By casting a wide net, you will increase your chances of finding the perfect job match,” Veerwal said.Advertisement
Navigating the job search process requires a combination of strategy, preparation, and adaptability. By defining your goals, embracing continuous learning, and leveraging diverse avenues for job hunting, you will position yourself for success in your career transition journey.

Volunteering and giving back
Valentine’s Day is not just about romantic love — it’s also about spreading kindness and compassion to those in need. Singles can use this day as an opportunity to give back to their community by volunteering at local shelters, food banks, or charity events.

"For Gen Z, Valentine’s Day is not just about love anymore","“When loyal hearts are crossed by none, true love will join them both in one;
For I do think where hearts agree, there can no strife nor malice be.”
February 14, 1826. The day these lines were written by a gentleman, along the edges of an ornately decorated Valentine Puzzle Purse to be gifted to their object of affection.
Forget boxes of chocolates and predictable flower bouquets. Imagine intricately crafted puzzle purses, their velvet pockets holding hidden messages and sentimental tokens, exchanged between sweethearts and admirers. Each unlocked compartment unfolded a layer of mystery, mirroring the complex emotions swirling around this day of love.Advertisement
Fast forward to the present, and while digital hearts fly across social media and pre-ordered roses arrive on cue, does modern love retain the romantic charm of yesteryear’s tokens? Have we traded handcrafted secrets for mass-produced sentiment? What is Valentine’s Day and the expression of love in this day and age?

For 26-year-old Mamta Marasini, Valentine’s Day is all about going the extra mile for your partner. “My then-boyfriend tried to cook for me. The wine and conversation flowed so well that we ended up putting too much salt in our cacio e pepe and had to order in,” Marasini says laughingly. Though it could be any other day too, this Valentine’s was particularly a “core memory” for Marasini.
Over the years, the dynamics of relationships have changed and there is a shift in the way people perceive love. Gen Z is changing the gender norms when it comes to relationships, said Mugdha Mhatre, psychologist, Mpower-Mumbai, adding that the onus of getting gifts and planning dinners does not lie on men alone, it is something that women actively take part in.
“This gendered version is anyway diminishing as people have same-sex partners. Gen Z is all about accepting love in all forms, while the concept of Galentine’s is millennial, we see Gen Z owning it more, celebrating it with their platonic friends, colleagues, cousins, siblings, and parents,” Mhatre explained.Advertisement
Tinder saw a 10 per cent increase in overall matches compared to an average day and a 17 per cent increase amongst 18-25-year-old users globally, around Valentine’s Day in 2023, and according to Aahana Dhar, director, communications, Tinder India, this is because young daters today are seeking adventure in new experiences and connections and self-discovery has never been more important.
“These singles are less concerned with where their relationship is heading, and more interested in creating memorable experiences, also known as N.A.T.O dating (a.k.a. Not Attached To Outcomes),” she explained in an interaction with indianexpress.com.
But some Gen Zers also find Valentine’s Day “too over-rated” like 23-year-old Mehak Pathan, who believes “love doesn’t need to be expressed in a single day; like an obligation.”
As per Bumble’s findings last year, 39 per cent of single Indians felt that Valentine’s Day is overrated and did not feel the need to celebrate it irrespective of whether they are dating or not.Advertisement
For those like Shivam Baruah, a 26-year-old advertising professional, the “aesthetic of consumption” around Valentine’s doesn’t sit well with him. “This one-day callout to love doesn’t really cut it for me. All this identity formation based on the capitalist side of things, which is legitimised with a day for love,” Baruah added.
Rosary Tuolor, 24, challenges this assumption. “Isn’t everything commercial these days? Capitalism is at its peak and omnipresent, can’t really escape it so why not just enjoy the ride while it lasts?”
According to a user-generated poll on the social discovery app Hunch, a majority of 63 per cent Gen Z weren’t interested in spending money on Valentine’s Day, out of more than 8,000 of them polled (and counting).
Cho, a Vietnamese restaurant in Delhi, has found that Gen Zers tend to view Valentine’s Day as a time for expressing love beyond conventional romance; booking for dinners etc.Advertisement

Gen Z is torn between celebrating Valentine’s Day or cringing upon it. While they are excited by the idea of it, they are aware of the capitalistic world and try not to get carried away, according to psychologist Mhatre.
This is not to say that Gen Z is erasing tradition entirely. They are simply adapting it to fit their values and experiences. Their approach prioritises authenticity, inclusivity, and meaningful connections, reflecting a more nuanced understanding of the diverse ways love can be expressed and celebrated.
They might not agree on whether they want to gift something to their significant others for Valentine’s but “refreshingly, Gen Z are not hesitant to challenge the status quo and date on their own terms and timelines,” Samarpita Samaddar, India communications director, Bumble, tells us.
Outdated traditions and forced celebrations have been thrown out the window, focusing more on genuine connections, said Shrey Sehgal, founder and CEO of gifting site FlowerAura. “The ultimate expression of affection and appreciation has shifted to thoughtful gifting and gestures, such as handmade gifts, unplanned dates and cherishing the time spent together,” Sehgal added.Advertisement
Varun Moolchandani, executive Director of Archies, echoed this sentiment. “Gen Z tends to embrace unique expressions of love, leaning towards personalised experiences over traditional gestures. We have noticed a rise in demand for customisable gifts and experiences that reflect individuality and authenticity,” Moolchandani said.
Kaushiki Negi wants to be that free too but, Valentine’s seems “more delulu when everything is going insane in the world, so I am just like mujhse pehli si mohabbat mere mehboob na maang. (Don’t ask me to love you like I loved you before).
But then there are still those Gen Zs for whom Valentine’s is renewing hope in a better world. Sahil Mukherjee, 24-year-old engineer, feels happy that Valentine’s Day exists. “Happy for people who find love in this dystopian world. Makes me think maybe the world isn’t dystopian and I’m just cynical, maybe,” Mukherjee said.
For Ahilya Jain, a 26-year-old who works in media and is otherwise surrounded by things that are wrong with the world, celebrating Valentine’s (or Galentine’s) with her loved ones gives her a chance to escape reality, hit pause and just revel in the celebration of love.Advertisement
 Valentine’s Day for Gen Z is no longer only about roses but rather experiences that blossom. (Source: Freepik)
While Valentine’s Day still encompasses romantic love, Gen Z sees it as a broader celebration of platonic, familial, and self-love, said Karima Ben Abdelmalek, CEO and president of dating site happn. “There are multiple factors contributing to the shift of Gen Z’s perception towards Valentine’s Day, the significant one being a cultural shift towards individualism and self-expression,” Abdelmalek said.
FlowerAura CEO Sehgal concurred with her, adding that, “as a generation that values experiences, making memories has become more important than collecting stuff that will eventually turn to dust. Galentine’s Day get-togethers and self-indulgence getaways have evolved into ways for single people to celebrate their self-love. Valentine’s Day is no longer for couples to celebrate and appreciate one another; families are using it as a chance to spend quality time together, friends are commemorating their friendship and single people are treating themselves to things that make them happy”.
Ilvika Chandawarkar, research and business development, Chiranjeev Restaurant and Foods Pvt Ltd (Malaka Spice Group), said, “We have observed that Gen Z usually comes in groups even on special days like this. There might be a group of friends or a amalgamation of 2-3 couple that come together to celebrate this special day, rather than just a single couple.”
Gen Z loves experiences, so restaurants have started creating innovative Valentine’s Day food & cocktail menus to cater to them. Red & pink toned cocktails, heart shaped food & desserts are especially a hit among them, noted Ankita Poojari, director, Shiv Sagar Foods & Resorts Pvt Ltd.Advertisement
Valentine’s Day for Gen Z is no longer only about roses but rather experiences that blossom. Celebrations that are more meaningful and less manufactured emphasise shared experiences rather than only material mementoes. The objective is to create memories rather than just cross things off a list.
So, whether it’s celebrating self-love, platonic friendships, or romantic relationships, Gen Z is proving that Valentine’s Day can be anything you want it to be, as long as it’s true to you. Love is a language with many dialects. Gen Z is simply speaking theirs.",lifestyle
"Is this combination of gur, chana and sesame seeds the ‘healthiest superfood’?","In the realm of nutrition, certain food combinations are celebrated for their synergy, offering a blend of taste and health benefits. One such powerful trio gaining attention is the combination of gur (jaggery), chana (chickpeas), and sesame seeds. Claiming it to be the “healthiest superfood combo,” nutritionist Leema Mahajan took to Instagram to share a quick recipe mixing the three ingredients. But is this food combo as healthy as being touted? We reached out to experts to investigate.
According to Dt. Priyanka Khandelwal, founder of Diet Planet, an online family nutrition clinic, “These three powerful ingredients make up traditional Indian winter sweets like laddoos, gajak, patti, and chikki.” “Gur, chana, and sesame seeds are a great snack or alternative for when you’re craving something sweet. It is a nutritionally balanced munchie,” she said.
The combination of gur, chana, and sesame seeds has a wide range of health benefits, said Shabana Parveen, a clinical nutritionist at Artemis Hospital, Gurgaon.Advertisement

Gur is a healthier option compared to sugar as it’s rich in iron, antioxidants, and minerals like magnesium and potassium. It helps in digestion and enhances energy levels.
Chana is high in protein, fibre, and necessary nutrients like folate and zinc, promoting muscle growth, stabilising blood sugar levels, and contributing to heart health.
Sesame seeds are rich in healthy fats, protein, and antioxidants, supporting bone health, reducing inflammation, and promoting skin and hair health.

“All of them together provide a balanced mix of carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats, making it a great choice for those who want sustained energy, regulated blood sugar, and overall well-being,” advised Parveen.
However, the nutritionist mentioned that some people should avoid consuming them. “Gur has a high sugar content, and people who are diabetic or are trying to manage blood sugar levels need to watch out for their consumption of this natural sweetener. Chana is a legume and is likely to cause digestive discomfort to some people, especially those who have irritable bowel syndrome or other digestive problems. Sesame seeds, being high in oxalates, may lead to the formation of kidney stones in some people. Therefore, those who have a history of kidney stones must limit their consumption of sesame seeds,” Parveen cautioned.

"Why autoimmune diseases affect more women than men, scientists answer. Is there any way to stay protected from them?","Imagine your body’s defences turning against itself – that’s the plight of millions suffering from autoimmune diseases like lupus and MS, which disproportionately affect women. Telling news from a Cell Journal study shines a light on a possible culprit: the X chromosome! Researchers discovered that specific molecules linked to the extra X chromosome women carry might hold the key, sometimes confusing the immune system and leading to these devastating conditions.
Dr Sourav Pradhan, consultant rheumatologist, Manipal Hospital, Salt Lake, Kolkata, explained that various hypotheses support why women suffer from more autoimmune diseases and one such hypothesis is regarding the female sex hormone in the female i.e. estrogen and progesterone. “Estrogen has a strong effect on the immune system. When there is an imbalance or inflammation of the estrogen hormone, the risk of autoimmune disease increases among women,” Dr Pradhan said.
Another is the chromosomal difference. Male and female embryos carry 22 identical pairs of chromosomes. The 23rd pair is different: Females carry two Xs, while males carry an X and a Y, which leads to the development of male sex organs.Advertisement
Most of the genes in the second X-chromosome in females are inactive and non-functional but few of the genes in this second X-chromosome are active. Dr Pradhan said that these active genes play an important role in maintaining the immunity in females. Thus, these genes are also the reason that plays a pathological role in increasing the chances of autoimmune disease.
There is no stated rule to prevent the autoimmune disease because of the biological set-up of a woman, however, there are some things that you can do.
A few lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, both active and passive, will minimise the chances of autoimmune diseases, according to Dr Pradhan, who described them as the following.
 While these strategies can be helpful, it’s important to consult your healthcare professional for personalised guidance based on your unique health profile and risks. (Source: File)
Embrace a Whole Food Diet: Ditch processed foods laden with sugar and unhealthy fats. Focus on consuming a diverse range of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. These provide essential nutrients that support a healthy immune system.Advertisement
Move Your Body Regularly: Exercise isn’t just for fitness; it’s a potent tool for immune health. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous activity weekly. Include activities you enjoy, like dancing, swimming, or cycling.
Prioritise Quality Sleep: Aim for 7-8 hours of restful sleep each night. Sleep deprivation weakens your immune system, making you more susceptible to various health issues.
Manage Stress Effectively: Chronic stress can wreak havoc on your immune system. Practice relaxation techniques like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing to manage stress effectively.
Maintain a Healthy Weight: Excess weight puts strain on your body and can contribute to inflammation, a key player in autoimmunity. Aim for a healthy weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise.Advertisement
Limit Smoking and Alcohol: Smoking and excessive alcohol consumption weaken your immune system and increase your risk of various health problems, including autoimmune diseases.
While these strategies can be helpful, it’s important to consult your healthcare professional for personalised guidance based on your unique health profile and risks. Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly improve outcomes for many autoimmune diseases. Don’t hesitate to seek medical advice if you have any concerns.",lifestyle

‘I don’t think theatre will ever lose relevance’: Kunaal Roy Kapur,"You may remember him from hit films like Delhi Belly, Nautanki Saala! or Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, but did you know that Kunaal Roy Kapur’s journey as an actor started with theatre? Yes, and despite experimenting with other mediums like television, OTT and podcasts, “performing for a live audience and feeling their energy is an addiction” that he hopes to never give up.
So, as Kunaal Roy Kapur preps for his upcoming play, Constellations, we caught up with him to talk about his love for the stage and much more. He also opened up about his career, new work, the many aspects of theatre, his family and what the family’s dinner table conversations usually look like.
Edited excerpts from the exclusive interview:
From a child actor to doing TV series and films—how would you describe your journey?Advertisement
The journey has been enjoyable. I’ve been fortunate to work with and learn from wonderful actors, directors, and technicians throughout my career and continue to do so. I am privileged to be able to make a living out of something I enjoy doing.

But it’s not just acting; over the years you have also dabbled in direction and podcasts. Tell us about these experiments and your learnings from them.
 I love feeding off people. Working with actors as a director is amazing. You get to use someone else’s life experiences to create a character. Even with the podcast, I find it so much better to chat with someone rather than talk into a void. So I guess some of the learning for me is about collaboration and the more people you can level with while creating something the better the work will be, and a lot more enjoyable.

While you are used to the camera, you are not new to theatre either. When did you discover your love for the stage?
It all started on the stage. I’ve been acting since I was 13-14 and the thrill of performing for a live audience and feeling their energy is an addiction I hope never to give up. Pearl Padamsee was one of my first acting instructors and I remember being in awe of her presence. Even though she was tiny, she commanded attention. I also remember standing in the wings through most of the play I’m not Bajirao and learning so much just watching and listening to the actors and the audience.Advertisement
As such, what is your play Constellations all about? What about it interested you to take up the role?
It’s about a couple and their relationship existing in a multiverse. So, there are different outcomes and possibilities of a relationship. I have often wondered about fate and chance as opposed to personal choice and how that plays a role in shaping your life, personality and relationships. The role is extremely challenging because it is a variation of the same person. I was also really excited to collaborate with Bruce Guthrie and Aahana Kumra.

What would you say is the most challenging and the best thing about theatre?
Keeping people engaged is the primary challenge. In the case of this play, it’s got a lot of variations of the same situation with small tweaks to character. So it’s quite a challenge to jump in and out of those. Every play has its challenges. Some have more to do with creating a visual spectacle and others more to do with tiny performance details. So it changes.

I don’t know enough about the number of people watching visiting the theatre, but people have a lot of choices today. With the increase in the number of venues, I hope the culture of visiting the theatre continues to grow.

In the era of OTT (with attention spans dwindling), how would you describe (and rate) the relevance of theatre?
I don’t think theatre will ever lose relevance. The experience of watching something live cannot be replaced. It’s the same reason why you would want to watch a musician performing live. Theatre also creates a lasting impression. It has been under fire from all the newer forms of media and entertainment but has lasted, stood the test of time, and in many parts of the world is thriving.
While you all have had your own journeys, you come from a “filmy” family. Does it ever get intimidating, competitive or insecure? Do you all often reach out to each other when it comes to discussing work?
We are all involved in films, but feel strange to be called a “film family” because we didn’t start out like that. We are very supportive of each other. We do have opinions on work and the industry at large but our choices remain our own.

We have seen you ace comedy and drama. Can we expect to see you in a romantic role shortly? What genre, personally, do you enjoy the most?
This play is funny, dramatic, and romantic, so working hard to get it right. I don’t really have a preferred genre, as long as the script is good and the director is fun to work with.
What can we expect from you in the new year?Advertisement
I hope to sharpen my skills, and learn something new. Read and grow. I hope to continue to act and hopefully even direct. And while you can expect this from me, what is most likely, is me lying on a couch doing absolutely nothing.
Directed by Bruce Guthrie, the play will be running from the 15-17 February, and 22-24 February at the Experimental Theatre, NCPA.",lifestyle
"Does consuming black seed oil help your gut, skin, hair in just 2-3 weeks?","In our pursuit to bring you the best healthy foods that can enhance your diet and lifestyle, we ensure those are verified by experts. This not only helps bring clarity to the claims but also helps you get the best of nutritional superfoods. As such, when we came across an Instagram reel from Herneshealth recommending the consumption of 1 teaspoon of black seed oil or kalonji oil on an empty stomach for skin, gut, and hair issues, we decided to explore more.
The reel mentioned some of the signs you might need black seed oil in your routine:
– Persistent skin issues like acne, eczema, or psoriasis.
– Regular digestive discomfort, such as bloating, gas, or IBS symptoms.
– Chronic inflammatory conditions, including joint pain or arthritis.
– Frequent infections or a compromised immune response.
Imagine a single natural remedy that boosts your energy, clears your skin, and supports your digestive health. Black seed oil is that powerhouse, it read. “Expect to see changes in 2-3 weeks.”Advertisement
“It’s not just for ingestion! Black seed oil is a versatile product for enhancing diets, moisturising skin, and enriching hair. Add it to smoothies, use it for skincare, or apply it to hair for a healthy boost. It’s your personal health stylist,” it further said.
Black seed oil, derived from the Nigella sativa plant, has long been touted for its potential health benefits. Advocates claim that its consumption can lead to various improvements in health, from boosting immunity to aiding digestion. But can these purported benefits manifest in as little as 2-3 weeks?
Black seed oil is known for its potential health benefits due to its rich composition of thymoquinone, thymol, and thymohydroquinone, which offer antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and enzyme inhibition properties. “The suggested morning ritual of taking 1 teaspoon on an empty stomach is a common recommendation,” said Sushma PS, chief dietician, Jindal Naturecure Institute.

While individual experiences may vary, some users report noticeable changes within this timeframe. One of the most commonly cited benefits is improved skin health. “Due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, black seed oil may help alleviate conditions such as acne or eczema. Users often observe clearer, smoother skin after consistent use,” said Dr Archana Batra, dietician, and a certified diabetes educator.Advertisement

However, Sushma highlighted that individual responses to supplements can be influenced by factors such as overall health, diet, lifestyle, and the specific health issues being addressed. It’s essential to keep in mind that dietary supplements are not guaranteed to work for everyone, and results can vary.
“If you’re considering incorporating black seed oil into your routine for specific health concerns, it’s advisable to consult with a healthcare professional for personalised advice based on your individual health needs and conditions. They can provide guidance on the appropriate dosage and duration based on your health goals,” said Sushma.",lifestyle
"From spoons to snowdrops, unique Valentine’s Day traditions around the globe","Love might be a universal language, but expressing it takes on colourful forms across the globe. Forget the standard box of chocolates and red roses this Valentine’s Day. From elaborate festivities to heartwarming gestures, let’s find out the unconventional Valentine’s Day customs from around the world.
Japan
In Japan, Valentine’s Day is primarily observed by women showering men with gifts, particularly chocolates. However, there’s a twist—the tradition of “giri-choco” or “obligation chocolate” where women give chocolates to male coworkers, friends, and acquaintances out of duty rather than romantic interest. A month later, on March 14th, known as “White Day,” men reciprocate the gesture by giving gifts, often white chocolates or other tokens of appreciation.
South Korea
Valentine’s Day is celebrated not only on February 14th but also on the 14th of every month throughout the year. Each month has a different theme, such as Rose Day, Kiss Day, and Hug Day. On these days, couples exchange corresponding gifts and gestures, culminating in a grand celebration on Valentine’s Day itself.Advertisement

Danish couples exchange pressed white flowers called “snowdrops” as a symbol of love on Valentine’s Day. Additionally, it’s a tradition for men to write affectionate notes or poems known as “gaekkebrev” and sign them anonymously with dots corresponding to their name’s letters. If the recipient correctly guesses the sender’s identity, they receive an Easter egg later in the year.
Wales
In Wales, Valentine’s Day is celebrated with a unique tradition called “Dydd Santes Dwynwen,” named after the Welsh patron saint of lovers. Couples exchange intricately carved wooden spoons, known as “love spoons,” adorned with symbols representing their affection and commitment to one another.
Finland
Valentine’s Day is known as “Ystävänpäivä,” in Finland, which translates to “Friend’s Day.” Instead of focusing solely on romantic love, Finns celebrate all types of relationships by exchanging cards and gifts with friends and family members.
Ghana
 While the holiday’s origins can be traced back to ancient Rome and Christian traditions, its observance has evolved over centuries, adapting to the diverse cultures and customs of countries worldwide. (Source: Freepik)
Valentine’s Day in Ghana is marked by vibrant festivals and events, often featuring live music, dancing, and cultural performances. It’s a time for communities to come together, celebrate love, and express appreciation for their loved ones. In Ghana, Valentine’s Day is also celebrated as “National Chocolate Day”, a strategic move by the government to promote tourism. Ghana is one of the largest producers of cocoa in the world.Advertisement

Why pomegranates are a must have in your diet,"There is so much written and spoken about healthy foods that one can lose track of what to have and what not to have. But worry not, as we bring you an expert guide almost every day on foods that are a must in your diet. As such, today’s in-depth analysis is about the red fruit with a hard leathery peel having tiny pearls of red juice – pomegranates.
If you have ever been wary of having pomegranates every day in your diet, here’s a foolproof guide to help you choose the best ones and understand why they need to be part of your diet.
Why is pomegranate one of the best foods?
Pomegranate is often regarded as one of the best foods due to its numerous health benefits and rich nutritional profile, said Sushma PS, chief dietitian, Jindal Naturecure Institute. “Pomegranates are rich in antioxidants, particularly polyphenols and anthocyanins. These compounds help neutralise free radicals in the body, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation,” said Sushma.Advertisement
Pomegranates are a good source of essential nutrients, including vitamin C, potassium, and fibre. “Pomegranates contain dietary fibre, which promotes digestive health by supporting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation,” said Sushma.
Sushma mentioned that the anti-inflammatory effects of pomegranates may benefit various conditions related to inflammation, including arthritis and other inflammatory disorders. According to the dietitian, there is evidence to suggest that pomegranate consumption may have positive effects on memory and cognitive function, potentially reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.
Pomegranates contain compounds with anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties, which may help boost the immune system and protect against infections. “Pomegranates are relatively low in calories and can be a satisfying snack, making them a suitable choice for those looking to manage their weight,” said Sushma.
Tips on buying and using
– Choosing a ripe pomegranate – Look for one that’s heavy for its size, which means it’s juicy and has smooth, unmarked skin, said Sushma.
– How to store pomegranates – Keep them in a cool, dry place or in the fridge to keep them fresh longer.
– Easy way to get seeds out – Cut off the top, score the sides, then break it open underwater to easily separate the seeds from the skin.Advertisement

No waste with pomegranates
Sushma suggested these measures:
– Pomegranate tea: Make tea with dried skins for a healthy drink.
– Pomegranate vinegar: Use the skins and seeds to make a tangy vinegar for cooking.
– Pomegranate powder: Dry and grind the skins to make a powder that adds nutrition to food and drinks.
Can I eat pomegranate every day?
Yes, eating it in moderation daily is good, said Sushma.
Will it affect my medicines?
Always ask your doctor, especially if you take medicine for thinning your blood.
When will I see health benefits?Advertisement
You might start noticing improvements in a few weeks, mentioned Sushma
Can children drink pomegranate juice?
Yes, it’s healthy for them in small amounts.
Are the benefits just for the body?
No, it’s good for your mind too because of the antioxidants, Sushma said.",lifestyle
"No! Foods like avocado, mushrooms are not the best sources of protein; here’s why","Leaving lentils pulses and chicken, there are many misconceptions about protein-rich foods. Many pick protein bars or avocado as rich sources of protein. The caveat is that they are not. If nutritionist Juhi Kapoor is to go by foods like spinach, protein bars, Brussels sprouts, avocado, mushrooms, and cauliflower are not the best sources of protein.
“Research suggests that certain protein bars may lack the nutritional quality of whole foods, as they might not provide the same range of micronutrients. Additionally, some bars may have an imbalanced macronutrient profile, with excessive sugars and limited fibre. High consumption of such bars may contribute to poor dietary habits and potential health issues. Moreover, the processing involved in making these bars can lead to nutrient degradation,” said Kapoor.
It’s essential to incorporate a variety of whole foods for a well-rounded and nutrient-rich diet, she added.Advertisement
We reached out to nutrition experts to decipher protein-rich foods for us.
Priya Sharma, chief nutritionist, Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute said that the landscape of protein sources is diverse, encompassing both plant and animal-based options, each offering unique nutritional benefits. “While plant-based sources like beans, lentils, tofu, and quinoa are celebrated for their protein content, it’s essential to acknowledge the wealth of options available for individuals to meet their dietary needs,” said Sharma.
Animal-based proteins, including lean meats, fish, eggs, and dairy, provide high-quality protein with essential amino acids necessary for various bodily functions. Sharma said that these sources offer nutritional diversity and can be particularly beneficial for individuals with specific dietary requirements or preferences.
However, plant-based proteins are gaining popularity due to their health benefits and environmental sustainability. They offer fibre, vitamins, and minerals alongside protein, contributing to a well-rounded diet. Additionally, plant-based options align with ethical considerations for some individuals, promoting a more compassionate approach to food consumption.Advertisement
While spinach, avocado, Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, cauliflower, and protein bars are indeed nutritious foods, they are not typically considered the best sources of protein when compared to certain plant-based options, said Sushma PS, chief dietitian, Jindal Naturecure Institute.
Spinach
Sushma noted that while spinach is a good source of iron, vitamins, and minerals, it is relatively low in protein compared to other options.

Avocado
Avocado is nutrient-dense and provides healthy fats, but it contains only a moderate amount of protein. It is not a primary protein source, mentioned Sushma.
Brussels sproutsAdvertisement
Brussels sprouts are rich in vitamins, fibre, and antioxidants, but they are not particularly high in protein compared to other vegetables, Sushma said.

Mushrooms
While mushrooms offer various health benefits, including vitamins and minerals, they are not particularly high in protein, mentioned Sushma.
Cauliflower
Cauliflower is a low-calorie vegetable with many nutrients, but its protein content is relatively low compared to dedicated protein sources, said Sushma.
Protein bars
Protein bars can be convenient for a quick protein boost, but some may contain added sugars and processed ingredients. Additionally, whole food sources are often preferred for overall nutrition, said Sushma.Advertisement

5 essential foods for a productive 9-to-5 work life,"In the fast-paced world of modern work, maintaining productivity throughout the 9-to-5 grind can often feel like an uphill battle. While caffeine may offer a temporary boost, sustained energy levels and mental focus require more than just a quick fix. As experts increasingly emphasise the role of nutrition in cognitive function and overall well-being, incorporating essential foods into your daily diet can be the key to unlocking productivity. Recently, nutritionist Lovneet Batra shared her top 5 foods that can fuel your workday and enhance your performance from dawn till dusk.
“Balancing a busy 9-to-5 lifestyle can often lead to neglected meals and compromised health,” Batra wrote in the caption. “Don’t let a packed schedule drain your energy. Embrace these tips to stay energised, focused, and heart-healthy. Your body (and your productivity) will thank you!” she added.

Buttermilk

Batra advised including buttermilk in your diet as it is a natural probiotic, rich in whey protein, which helps keep energy levels high and stable, satisfies hunger, and promotes optimal hydration. “It helps counteract the dehydration often neglected during busy work hours,” she explained.Advertisement
The best time to consume buttermilk is around mid-morning, 10 to 11 am.

Mint Tea

According to Batra, mint tea is a solid alternative to traditional tea and coffee as it aids digestion and combats acidity that is often exacerbated due to the excessive consumption of the above. “It provides a refreshing lift and supports gut health, crucial for maintaining focus and preventing discomfort,” she added.
It is recommended to sip on mint tea post-lunch to avoid the afternoon slump.

Banana

Packed with potassium and natural sugars, bananas help maintain mental alertness and physical energy. “It offers a quick, nutritious energy boost without the crash, supporting sustained concentration and performance,” Batra noted.Advertisement
Having a banana mid-morning or as an afternoon snack can help increase energy levels.

Roasted Chana

High in fiber and protein, roasted chana supports sustained energy levels and promotes satiety. Batra said that it acts as a healthy, crunchy snack that keeps you full, stabilises blood sugar, and prevents overeating.
The nutritionist suggests consuming it mid-afternoon or as a pre-lunch snack.

Pistachios

Batra explained that pistachios are loaded with healthy fats, protein, and antioxidants, which support heart health and maintain healthy blood sugar levels. Additionally, it is a guilt-free treat that satisfies your hunger while providing essential nutrients for long-term health.Advertisement

What happens to your body if you give up dairy products for a month?,"In recent years, the trend of eliminating dairy from one’s diet has gained significant traction. Whether motivated by ethical concerns, environmental considerations, or health-related reasons, many individuals are opting to give up dairy products for a month to observe the impact on their overall well-being.
This dairy-free experiment can yield various results, affecting not only physical health but also mental and emotional aspects.
According to Dr Dilip Gude, senior consultant physician, Yashoda Hospitals Hyderabad, when one cuts down dairy, there is a benefit of removing excess saturated fats, sugar and salt from their diet.Advertisement
“Over 3 weeks, this benefit translates to various systems in the body. Heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s etc are some disorders that may worsen with daily consumption of full-fat dairy,” Dr Gude explained in an interaction with indianexpress.com. 
Some people experience weight loss when they cut out dairy, as dairy products can be high in calories and fat, however, Dr K. Somnath Gupta, senior consultant physician and diabetology, Yashoda Hospitals Hyderabad, noted that this effect varies among individuals, and it’s crucial to maintain a balanced diet to avoid potential nutrient deficiencies.
Eliminating dairy for a month may lead to improvements in digestive issues for some individuals, Dr Gupta added. “Lactose, a sugar found in milk, can cause digestive discomfort in those who are lactose intolerant. Removing dairy allows the digestive system to operate without the challenge of processing lactose, potentially reducing bloating, gas, and diarrohea.”
On top of this, the acidic nature of dairy foods combined with some degree of lactose intolerance causes bloating, acidity, and extra hard work by the body to digest these products. When one quits them, it also helps restore acid/alkali balance, explained Dr Gude. Hence, those with IBS or Irritable Bowel Syndrome benefit from quitting milk.Advertisement
Dr Gupta added that dairy can influence the composition of the gut microbiome. “Removing dairy may alter the balance of gut bacteria, which can have both positive and negative effects on digestive health. Individual responses to these changes can vary,” he said.
Skin health and anti-ageing benefits are known to occur within four weeks of stopping dairy consumption, said Dr Gude. According to Dr Gupta, some studies suggest a link between dairy consumption and acne, though the relationship is complex and not universally applicable. “Skin improvements could be due to factors like reduced inflammation or hormonal fluctuations associated with dairy,” he said.

As we all know, dairy products are a significant source of calcium, vital for bone health. So, stopping their consumption may result in nutrient deficiencies like calcium, vitamin D, protein etc which need to be replenished orally either as supplements or by use of alternative foods such as soya, almonds, tofu, broccoli, figs, sunflower seeds etc.
Some other alternative sources of calcium are leafy greens, and fortified plant-based milk. “Inadequate calcium intake can impact bone density, so it’s important to ensure sufficient alternatives are consumed,” said Dr Gupta.Advertisement
According to Dr Gude, breast, ovarian and prostate cancers are also linked to chronic dairy use. Metabolism, sleep, and memory are also known to improve, he added.
This might be because some people report feeling more energised after giving up dairy. “This could be related to improved digestion, reduced inflammation, or individual responses to certain dairy components. However, individual responses to dietary changes vary, and energy levels can be influenced by various factors,” said Dr Gupta.
He said individuals with lactose intolerance or a sensitivity to dairy proteins may experience improvements in respiratory conditions, such as reduced mucus production or congestion, after eliminating dairy. However, this is not a universal outcome, and individual responses vary.",lifestyle

Can drinking ginger tea help your scalp health?,"Ginger tea or adrak wali chai is a favourite with many owing to its soothing properties especially when you have a headache. But when we came across an Instagram post from dietitian Suman Tibrewala, suggesting that including ginger in meals or as a tea can help a healthy scalp, we decided to ask our in-house dermatologists.
Dr Rinky Kapoor, consultant dermatologist, cosmetic dermatologist, and dermato-surgeon, The Esthetic Clinics said drinking ginger tea can indeed contribute to scalp health in several ways, thanks to the various beneficial properties of ginger. “Ginger, derived from the rhizome of the Zingiber officinale plant, has been recognised for its potential health benefits, including those related to the scalp,” said Dr Kapoor.
Anti-inflammatory properties
Ginger contains bioactive compounds with potent anti-inflammatory effects. Scalp inflammation is often associated with conditions like dandruff and psoriasis. Dr Kapoor said that regular consumption of ginger tea may help reduce inflammation, potentially alleviating symptoms associated with these scalp issues.
Improved blood circulationAdvertisement
Ginger has vasodilatory effects, meaning it helps widen blood vessels and improve blood circulation. “Enhanced blood flow to the scalp ensures better nutrient and oxygen delivery to hair follicles, promoting overall hair health,” said Dr Kapoor.
However, direct evidence linking ginger tea consumption to improved scalp health is limited. “It’s essential to maintain a balanced diet and good hygiene practices for optimal scalp health,” said Dr Jatin Mittal, co-founder, skin expert and cosmetologist, Abhivrit Aesthetics New Delhi.
Antioxidant benefits
Antioxidants in ginger, such as gingerol, play a role in neutralising free radicals. “Free radicals can contribute to oxidative stress, which may affect the health of hair follicles. By combating oxidative stress, ginger tea may support a healthier scalp environment,” said Dr Kapoor.

Dandruff managementAdvertisement
Dandruff, often caused by a fungus called Malassezia, can lead to an itchy and flaky scalp. Dr Kapoor mentioned that ginger possesses anti-fungal properties that may help in managing dandruff. “Applying ginger-infused solutions or rinses directly to the scalp can be an additional topical approach,” said Dr Kapoor.
Stress reduction
Chronic stress is linked to various scalp and hair issues, including hair loss. “Ginger has adaptogenic properties that may help the body cope with stress. Consuming ginger tea may contribute to overall stress reduction, indirectly benefiting scalp health,” mentioned Dr Kapoor.

Nutrient support
Ginger is a good source of certain vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin C, magnesium, and zinc. Dr Kapoor said that these nutrients play essential roles in maintaining overall skin and scalp health.
How to use ginger for scalp health?
Apart from drinking ginger tea, you can explore other ways to incorporate ginger into your hair care routine. “This includes creating ginger-infused hair masks or rinses. Additionally, topical application of ginger oil or extracts may provide direct benefits to the scalp,” said Dr Kapoor.
CautionAdvertisement
While ginger is generally considered safe for consumption, individuals with certain medical conditions or those on specific medications should consult with a healthcare professional before making significant changes to their diet, urged Dr Kapoor.

Are you dealing with vitamin deficiencies? Here is what your body is trying to tell you,"From bolstering our immune system to fortifying our bones, vitamins play an essential role for our health. Yet, despite their importance, many individuals unwittingly suffer from deficiencies, often unaware of the subtle cues their bodies are sending. Recently, nutritionist Apurwa Agarwal took to Instagram to share the silent yet telling signs that your body may be grappling with a shortage of vital vitamins.
“Recognising these symptoms can be the first step towards addressing nutritional imbalances,” she captioned the post.
We reached out to experts on how to address these vitamin deficiencies and resolve the health issues accompanying them.Advertisement
Vitamin D
Agarwal noted that constantly being sick, feeling blue, hair loss, declining bone density and sore muscles are signs of vitamin D deficiency.
To prevent this deficiency, Dr Rajmadhangi D, MBBS, MD (general Medicine), Apollo Spectra Hospital, Chennai advises to spend time outdoors to allow your skin to produce vitamin D in response to sunlight. Additionally, including vitamin D-rich foods in your diet, such as fatty fish, fortified dairy products and eggs is important. “Consult a healthcare professional for vitamin D supplements, if necessary,” she added.
Iron
Headache or dizziness, pale skin, chest pain, inflammation or soreness of tongue, and brittle nails are signs that your body is dealing with iron deficiency, Agarwal mentioned.
The best way to combat this deficiency, according to Kalpana Gupta, clinical nutritionist, Max Smart Super Speciality Hospital, Saket, is to consume iron-rich food. “Non vegetarian food, like beef, liver, fish and sea food, is the most bioavailable form of iron that is easily absorbed by the body. Vegetarian sources such as peas, legumes, dark green leafy veggies, and whole grains like bajra and ragi, are also full of iron,” she recommended.Advertisement
Another way is to increase iron absorption in the body. “Add citric foods like lemons with meals to enhance the iron absorption. Using iron utensils for cooking helps increase the iron content of food. Germinated and fermented foods like sprouts and idli can also be consumed,” Gupta said.
Vitamin B-12
Signs like loss of appetite, nausea, disorientation, disturbed vision and a pricking sensation can indicate a vitamin B-12 deficiency, Agarwal cautioned.
Chandni Haldurai, nutrition head, Cult.Fit, recommended dietary changes to prevent this deficiency. “Eat foods high in vitamin B-12 such as dairy, meat, fish and eggs. Limiting alcohol is also important as it can disrupt the absorption of this vitamin,” she said.
Additionally, Haldurai advises supplementation if the deficiency continues. “In extreme circumstances, medical professionals may use intramuscular injection.”Advertisement
Magnesium
Agarwal urged that nighttime leg cramps, anxiety, neck and shoulder pain, constipation and menstrual disorders might be symptoms of magnesium deficiency.
Dr Rajmadhangi said that magnesium-rich foods like leafy greens, nuts, seeds and whole grains can address this deficiency. Even reducing the intake of caffeine and alcohol can help, as they contribute to magnesium loss. Using topical magnesium oils or creams for better absorption through the skin, can also combat magnesium deficiency.

While dietary modifications can often address these deficiencies, Dr Rajmadhangi said that it’s essential to consult a nutritionist or a medical expert for personalised advice. “A well-balanced and nutrient-dense diet, coupled with supplements, when necessary, can play a significant role in preventing and addressing vitamin deficiencies, ensuring a healthier and more vibrant life.”",lifestyle
Celebrity trainer Yasmin Karachiwala introduces TheraLoop and TheraBand to elevate workouts,"In the realm of fitness, achieving optimal results often requires innovative tools and techniques. TheraLoop and TheraBand have emerged as two prominent accessories revolutionising the fitness landscape. And its most recent proponent is none other than celebrity fitness instructor Yasmin Karachiwala, who demonstrated quick and effective exercises using the props.
What exactly are TheraLoop and TheraBand?
TheraLoop and TheraBand are distinct tools designed to enhance different aspects of fitness training. “TheraLoop is a resistance band with built-in loops at each end. These loops offer versatility in exercises by providing anchor points for your hands or feet. TheraLoop bands are typically made of latex or similar elastic materials, offering varying levels of resistance depending on their color or thickness. They are commonly used in strength training, rehabilitation exercises, and flexibility training,” Utsav Agrawal, an advanced trainer, tells indianexpress.com in an interaction.
On the other hand, TheraBands are resistance bands without loops at the end. “These bands come in various colors, each denoting a different level of resistance. TheraBands are versatile and can be used for strength training, stretching, and improving flexibility and mobility,” explains Agrawal.

Benefits
According to Agrawal, TheraLoop bands offer a wide range of exercises targeting different muscle groups and can be easily adapted to accommodate various fitness levels. Additionally, they are lightweight, compact, and relatively inexpensive, making them ideal for travel and home workouts. “TheraLoop bands provide resistance without the impact on joints that heavier weights can cause, making them suitable for individuals recovering from injuries or dealing with joint issues,” he added.Advertisement
Meanwhile, TheraBands offer progressive resistance, meaning the resistance increases as the band is stretched, allowing for a challenging workout without the need for heavy weights. “TheraBands can be used for dynamic stretching exercises, helping improve flexibility and range of motion. Moreover, they are commonly used in rehabilitation settings to strengthen muscles, improve joint stability, and aid in recovery from injuries,” Agrawal shared.

Who should avoid
While these tools are generally safe for most individuals, individuals with latex allergies must use latex-free brands, and those with certain medical conditions or injuries must practice under the supervision of a qualified fitness professional or healthcare provider to ensure proper technique and safety.

‘Not another word for cheating’: Navigating polyamory in modern India and its gaining popularity,"Recall Zoya Akhtar’s The Archies: A bright-eyed Archie Andrews (Agastya Nanda) confesses to Betty Cooper (Khushi Kapoor) and Veronica Lodge (Suhana Khan) that he loves them both and cannot choose. Perplexed, the girls exchange glances before collectively deciding to dump him. This brings us to a significant question — are our hearts constrained to loving only one?
While Archie’s ‘two-timing’ situation is not the best approach, an increasing number of individuals are turning to polyamorous relationships. In fact, according to Bumble’s recent study conducted in 2022, 61 per cent of single Indians surveyed were open to exploring ethical non-monogamy. Yet, as Anitha J, consultant clinical psychologist at Niyama Healthcare, noted, this phenomenon is hardly novel.
Non-monogamous relationships boast a lineage dating back to antiquity, evidenced in historical texts such as the Itihasas and Puranas, even manifesting in the epic Mahabharata where Draupadi is wedded to the five Pandava brothers, illustrating longstanding polyamorous dynamics in ancient cultures.Advertisement
So, why do people opt for such relationships?
 A still from Archies comics.
Twenty-nine-year-old Vaishnavi Prabhu realised much later in life that she had the “capacity to receive and share love with more than just one person.” She also found out that being open to multiple partners could help her stay emotionally fulfilled. “I could have a partner for each facet of my life,” she said.
Reflecting on her journey, Prabhu said that her previous partner was romantic, but she yearned for someone who shared her passion for cinema. “Being polyamorous,” she mused, “opened up the possibilities.”
A Pune-based communications consultant also found herself stifled within the confines of monogamy. She believes that she has always been polyamorous but only recently found the “right vocabulary to navigate it.” “I learnt about polyamory through an acquaintance who talked about her journey. It fascinated me, so I researched online and found similar stories of people,” the 29-year-old shared.
At that moment, she felt heard and seen. “Knowing that a practice like polyamory exists lifted a huge sense of guilt from my conscience.”Advertisement
Similarly, Shweta Sangtani, 37, CEO of the Sangya Project, had a discussion with her husband eight years ago that opened them up to a polyamorous setup. “After this conversation, we began to realise that we all viewed relationships in a cookie-cutter format — a template of what is okay and what is not,” she said.
The two decided that the boundaries of their relationship depended solely on their equation, rather than societal norms. “We came to a conclusion that we both were fine with dating other people as long as there was full transparency and communication,” Sangtani said.
Rise in popularity

While polyamorous relationships have historically operated discreetly under social and legal strictures, shifting tides of acceptance have fostered a more hospitable milieu for open discourse. “The growing acceptance of diverse sexual orientations, coupled with discussions around LGBTQ rights, has created a more supportive environment for individuals practising polyamory to openly share and discuss their experiences,” Anitha J said.
The term “polyamory,” coined in 1960 from Latin roots meaning ‘many loves’, may be relatively recent, said Dr Jitender Jakhar, consultant psychiatrist at Sitaram Bhartia Hospital, New Delhi.Advertisement
However, he added that consensual non-monogamous arrangements, including polygamy, polyandry, and the French “menage à trois,” have historical antecedents.
“The practice of engaging in multiple romantic relationships with the consent of all involved has gained increased visibility and acceptance in recent years, thanks to changing cultural norms that challenge traditional relationship expectations. Positive media representation, including books, movies, and TV shows, also helps normalise consensual non-monogamy,” he explained.
Additionally, the evolving landscape of alternative relationship configurations reflects a growing realisation that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to relationships. “Individuals are now willing to explore other options when traditional monogamy does not align with their needs. Empowerment and individualism further contribute to the acceptance of polyamory, aligning with a societal trend where people seek relationships that offer personal fulfillment and self-expression,” Dr Jakhar said.
Couple’s therapist and dating coach Prachi Saxena Vaish attests to witnessing a surge in unconventional relationship structures, often stemming from past relational traumas. She clarified that while polyamory may manifest as a sexual orientation realised late due to societal conditioning, it can also denote a deliberate lifestyle choice adopted later in life.Advertisement
Common misconceptions

Prabhu has encountered numerous times that people perceived her polyamory as commitment issues and promiscuity. “When I put polyamorous as a part of my bio on a dating app, a lot of men assumed I was open to hookups,” she said.
The communications consultant also lamented the misperception of equating polyamory to infidelity. “Polyamory is viewed as a practice rooted in having sex with multiple people, but it is not another word for cheating,” she said. “It becomes hard for a lot of men to be okay with the idea of a ‘liberated’ woman because of ingrained societal biases. It can get quite lonely and isolating.”
In reality, Ananya Pant, a queer affirmative therapist and researcher, said that polyamory espouses values of honesty, trust, and communication. “If someone is cheating on another person under the name of being polyamorous, it is simply cheating and not polyamory. Ethically, a polyamorous person would always keep their situation right in front of you before they proceed with the relationship,” Pant mentioned.
Another myth is that there are no boundaries in polyamorous relationships. “Polyamory is essentially having multiple relationships requiring emotional investment like any relationship does — be it romantic or platonic. Being polyamorous does not mean that anything goes,” Sangtani said.Advertisement
People also assume that those in ethically non-monogamous relationship structures aren’t serious about their partners or are incapable of experiencing deep love. “When you choose to date multiple people, you are also dealing with the emotional history and baggage that multiple people come with. This requires a level of communication and transparency that a lot of us often ignore. It also requires a lot of self-awareness. Caring for multiple people requires being present with each of them and making sure that they know exactly where they stand with you. It isn’t as simplistic as being greedy. Contrary to popular belief, it isn’t just an easy way out or an excuse to have light situations with multiple people,” Sangtani added.
One more misguided belief is that polyamory serves as a quick fix for existing relationship issues. “Polyamory demands even stronger communication and problem-solving skills. Introducing additional partners without addressing underlying problems can lead to complications rather than resolving issues,” said Dr Jakhar.
What to consider

Practising polyamory in a country like India presents several challenges compared to regions where it is legally accepted or more socially embraced. “The lack of acceptance and prevailing social stigma make it difficult for individuals in polyamorous relationships to openly practice and express their choices,” said Anitha J, adding that this can impede an individual’s autonomy and emotional well-being.
Another challenge is managing relationships with multiple partners. “A fast-paced lifestyle and demanding commitments already leave limited time for family life. Now, dividing that remaining time among multiple partners can be challenging,” Anitha J added.
Juggling the demands of multiple relationships may result in exhaustion and emotional strain, potentially affecting the overall health of the individual.Advertisement
Jealousy might also arise. A 26-year-old digital marketer felt his primary partner become overly possessive when he spent time with his other partner. Things went further south when his partner asked him to date her exclusively. “I eventually ended things with both partners. After this ordeal, I am settling for monogamous relationships,” he said on condition of anonymity.
To combat this challenge, Vaish emphasises the importance of communication. “Polyamorous relationships flourish with clear, transparent communication. If something one of your partners is doing is sparking jealousy, talk to them about it and figure out the root of insecurity. Don’t be afraid to assert your boundaries when someone tries to encroach on yours.”
On the other hand, Dr Jakhar said effective planning is crucial before entering this dynamic. “Logistical challenges, such as coordinating schedules and living arrangements, require planning and adaptability. Time management to meet the needs of multiple partners necessitates careful scheduling and prioritisation.”
Before embarking on this journey, Vaish suggested individuals introspect and understand what they’re looking for. “A lot of people find the idea interesting and want to try it for ‘fun’ but remember it is your emotions at stake, as well as other people’s too.”Advertisement

Pant also recommends people learn more about the practice before entering it. “Read articles, watch videos, hear from people who have lived experiences and educate yourself before you get into it. Finding like-minded individuals and a community can be vital for emotional support.”
In essence, polyamory is all about honesty, trust, and communication. “Recognise the importance of consent, respect for partners’ feelings, and continuous communication to foster a healthy and sustainable polyamorous dynamic,” Pant added.",lifestyle
Have purple carrots in your diet; here’s why,"Winter season vegetables are a sight to behold. The colourful variety adds a much-needed dash to one’s winter diet. Leading the pack are purple carrots. Have you had them? For the unversed, purple carrots offer a unique twist to the traditional orange and red variety, and their distinctive colour comes from anthocyanins, powerful antioxidants with potential health benefits.
“These compounds contribute to the vegetable’s vibrant hue and have been linked to anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. Additionally, anthocyanins may support cardiovascular health by reducing oxidative stress and promoting blood vessel function,” said Priya Bharma, chief nutritionist, Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute.
Beyond their antioxidant content, purple carrots are rich in essential nutrients like beta-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A known for promoting eye health and immune function. “The combination of various phytonutrients in purple carrots contributes to a well-rounded nutritional profile, supporting overall well-being,” mentioned Bharma.Advertisement
Furthermore, these colourful vegetables may aid in weight management and digestion due to their fibre content. “Fibre supports a healthy gut microbiome and can help regulate blood sugar levels. “Incorporating purple carrots into your diet not only diversifies your nutrient intake but also adds visual appeal to meals, making them an enticing and nutritious option for those seeking a health-conscious and visually appealing culinary experience,” said Bharma.
Gut microbiome specialist Shonali Sabherwal shared that she uses them to make kanji, a probiotic-rich drink. “Root vegetables give you that strong downward yang energy (warming) in winter and upward yin energy (to expend),” said Sabherwal.

She also shared that being rich in digestive enzymes, they improve digestibility, balance stomach acid, feed on positive gut bacteria, and are rich in B12 and other nutrients.

No more heartbreaks! Train yourself to recognise red flags this Valentine’s week,"Falling in love is a glorious, dizzying plunge. But sometimes, amidst the fireworks, blind spots emerge. We ignore warning signs, dismiss inconsistencies, and end up tripping over hidden red flags, leaving our hearts bruised and battered.
So, how do we navigate this emotional terrain with awareness, protecting ourselves from unnecessary heartache? Recognising red flags in a relationship is a skill that can spare us from unnecessary pain and disappointment.
According to Anu Rajgarhia, psychologist, Mpower, it all begins with self-reflection. “Understand your own values, goals and personal boundaries. In this way, you can know when someone is portraying values and goals significantly different from yours or if they have no respect for your boundaries,” she tells indianexpress.com in an interaction.Advertisement
There are some other ways too when it comes to training your heart to spot the landmines of love:
Communication is key, but watch for manipulation
Open and honest communication is the lifeblood of any healthy relationship. However, beware of partners who twist arguments, gaslight you, or guilt-trip you into sacrificing your needs. Healthy communication involves listening, respecting different viewpoints, and finding solutions together.
Watch for unhealthy possessiveness and jealousy.
A sprinkle of jealousy can be flattering, but suffocating possessiveness is a major red flag. If your partner tries to control your social life, monitor your activities, or isolate you from loved ones, it’s a sign of controlling behavior that can quickly turn toxic.
Actions speak louder than words.
Pay attention to inconsistencies. Grand promises and romantic gestures are lovely, but watch for inconsistency between their words and actions. Does their behavior consistently support their declarations? If their actions paint a different picture, listen to that discrepancy.

Beware of red flags disguised as “red herrings.”
Sometimes, we confuse genuine quirks with red flags. For example, someone with a reserved personality might not be expressive with love, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they lack affection. However, if their reservedness manifests as emotional unavailability or lack of communication, then it’s a cause for concern.Advertisement
Be informed
Reading and being informed about healthy relationships and red flags can help spot them when they show themselves in your interactions.
Trust your intuition
Trusting your intuition and speaking to a trusted adult can help you see things that you otherwise may not identify as a red flag.
Some disagreements can be okay
Of course, when two people enter a relationship it takes a while to understand each other. Disagreements are a part of any relationship. Every disagreement is not a red flag. Commitment to work towards building a healthy partnership is essential.",lifestyle
How useful is the Dutch art of purposely doing nothing?,"Ever feel overwhelmed by the constant need to be “on”? We live in a culture that glorifies busyness, pushing us to fill every moment with tasks and stimulation. But what if the key to a happier, more balanced life lies in the opposite direction? Enter Niksen, a Dutch concept that translates to “doing nothing,” an art form of purposeful idleness.
Dr Shaunak Ajinkya, consultant psychiatrist at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital Mumbai, sheds light on this revolutionary approach to well-being.
Niksen: Beyond Laziness, Embracing the Pause
Forget Netflix binges or mindless scrolling. Niksen isn’t about escaping into distractions; it’s about purposefully choosing stillness. Imagine gazing out the window without an agenda, allowing your mind to wander freely. Or simply resting, basking in the present moment without the pressure to achieve. That’s the essence of Niksen.Advertisement
Dr Ajinkya clarified the distinction from mindfulness: “While both involve being present, Niksen is more passive, accepting idleness without actively focusing on anything. It’s like hitting the pause button, giving your mind a chance to recharge and rejuvenate.”
Benefits Beyond Relaxation: A Path to Mental Well-being
Research paints a compelling picture. From reducing stress and anxiety to boosting creativity and strengthening the immune system, the benefits of slowing down are undeniable.

Dr Ajinkya emphasised the connection with burnout: “Niksen offers a deliberate escape from the constant hustle, creating space for self-reflection and self-care – crucial for preventing burnout. It can also help cultivate a more mindful approach to life, making us better equipped to recognise the signs of burnout before it takes hold.”
Bringing Niksen into Your Life: Simple Steps to Start Now
Intrigued? Incorporating Niksen into your daily routine is easier than you think. Here are Dr Ajinkya’s suggestions:Advertisement
Schedule “niksen breaks”: Carve out 15-30 minutes daily or weekly, free from distractions. Find a quiet space, disconnect from devices, and simply be present.
Seize everyday moments: Waiting in line? Embrace the pause. Observe your surroundings or let your mind wander freely without judgment.
Embrace simple activities: Listen to calming music, take a walk in nature, or sit in silence. It’s not about laziness; it’s about mindful moments of rest and recharge.
Remember, Niksen is a personal journey. Experiment, find what works for you, and don’t be afraid to adjust your practice. As Dr. Ajinkya concludes, “By embracing the art of doing nothing, you might unlock the key to a more balanced, creative, and healthier life.”Advertisement
So, take a deep breath, hit pause, and discover the transformative power of Niksen. Your mind, body, and spirit will thank you for it.",lifestyle

What happens to your body when you go on a 7-day water only fast?,"Most people can give up their diet for fruits, sugar, or chocolate, but have you ever wondered what happens to your body if you give up everything except water? “A seven-day water fast entails giving up all meals and drinking solely water throughout that time,” said Dr Babina N.M, chief medical officer, Jindal Naturecure Institute.
As such, what changes occur in the body? Is it sustainable for longer periods? We decided to reach out to experts.
Lakshita Jain, clinical dietitian and founder, NUTR, Delhi explained that many religions in India, like Jainism, have been practicing water fasting for a long time. “Recently, Western studies have shown interest in the potential benefits of a 7-day water fast, especially regarding cancer. Yes, there can be issues like not getting enough nutrients, imbalances in electrolytes, and losing muscle if fasting for too long. However, if done for a short time and with care, it might have some benefits,” said Jain.Advertisement
Jain mentioned that on the first day of water fasting, your body can act like a cleanser. “On the second day, you might feel very light. But from the third day, your body may start slowing down. If your body feels okay, you can continue, but if not, it is important to stop,” said Jain.
Explaining the changes in detail, Dr Babina listed the following:
“During a seven-day water fast, the following broad physiological and possible impacts could manifest,” said Dr Babina.
Autophagy: The body uses fasting to trigger an autophagic process that eliminates damaged cells and replaces them with healthier ones. Cellular health may benefit from this in the future, said Dr Babina.
Ketosis: The body may go into a state of ketosis during a period of fasting, during which it begins using fat for energy rather than carbs. This is a normal metabolic process that takes place while you fast.Advertisement
Weight loss: A seven-day fast is likely to cause weight loss since it lowers caloric intake and forces the body to burn fat and stored glycogen for energy, mentioned Dr Babina.
Blood sugar control: Insulin sensitivity and blood sugar regulation may both be enhanced by fasting.
“Before trying an extended fast, those with diabetes or other metabolic abnormalities should speak with their healthcare professional,” said Dr Babina.
Detoxification: According to some supporters, fasting aids in the body’s detoxification by removing accumulated toxins. Nonetheless, there is little scientific proof to back up this assertion, as the body already has detoxification processes in place, asserted Dr Babina.Advertisement
 These are the changes that occur (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)
Energy levels: As the body becomes used to using alternate fuel sources, energy levels may initially drop. When starting a water fast, some people may feel tired, lightheaded, or agitated, cautioned Dr Babina.
Electrolyte imbalance: Prolonged fasting may result in electrolyte abnormalities, which can cause symptoms including weakness, cramping in the muscles, or erratic heartbeats. “It’s critical to keep an eye on electrolyte levels and, if needed, think about supplementing,” said Dr Babina.
Mental clarity: While some people report better attention and mental clarity when fasting, others may find it difficult to concentrate, mentioned Dr Babina.
Digestive system rest: When a person fasts, their digestive system is spared from breaking down food, which frees up energy for other bodily functions including regeneration and repair.Advertisement
If you have health issues like high blood pressure or blood sugar, it is crucial to do this under guidance, experts urge. “If you are doing it on your own, pay attention to what your body tells you,” said Jain.
Who must not do it at all?
It’s crucial to stress that not everyone should fast, particularly for an extended length of time. Dr Babina said, “Before undertaking any extended fast, people with pre-existing medical illnesses, women who are pregnant or nursing, and people who have a history of eating disorders should speak with a healthcare provider.”

Ditch coffee for these healthy instant energy foods,"When we are tired, busy at work, or playing any sport, we often look for foods that give us instant energy. Instead of opting for that cup of coffee for a caffeine high, try and choose foods that are nourishing too. Dietitian Richa Doshi mentioned that you can opt for options like dates, curd, and curd with seeds and nuts as tastier, healthier options.
Dietitian Simrat Bhui said curd contains protein and when mixed with berries and seeds, it becomes a bowl full of nutrients.
Bhui also mentioned some other sources
Healthy fats: Nut butter is very much in demand nowadays and it gives the fullness that maintains sugar levels.
Curd or yogurt: It contains protein and when mixed with berries and seeds it becomes a bowl full of nutrients.
Citrus fruits: They are rich in vitamin C and potassium which replenish your electrolyte balance and hence feel energetic.
Iron-rich foods: Foods like spinach, beetroot, and beans are rich in iron. “Iron in our body overcomes fatigue and helps in the absorption of vitamin C,” said Bhui.
Eggs: Eggs are called complete food and nothing can compete for nutrients and energy, Bhui said.  Since protein-rich, and packed with essential amino acids, eggs are a nutritious option for an energy boost. “They also contain B-vitamins, which aid in converting food into energy,” said Dr Ranga Santhosh Kumar, consultant general physician and diabetologist, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad.Advertisement
 Oats provide instant energy (Soure: Freepik)
Oats: Complex carbohydrates in oats provide a steady release of energy. Dr Kumar said that oats also contain beta-glucans, which help regulate blood sugar levels and sustain energy throughout the day.

Dark Chocolate: Dark chocolate with at least 70 per cent cocoa content contains caffeine for a mild stimulant effect. “It also has flavonoids and antioxidants that support heart health and improve blood flow, aiding in alertness,” said Dr Kumar.
Oranges: High in vitamin C and natural sugars, oranges offer a quick energy pick-me-up. The fibre content helps regulate the release of glucose into the bloodstream, preventing energy crashes, said Dr Kumar.

Potassium-rich foods: Potassium is one of the electrolytes in our body that provides energy in abundance and it should be included in our diet daily. “For eg, banana, avocado, and green leafy vegetables,” said Bhui. Packed with natural sugars, particularly glucose, fructose, and sucrose, bananas offer a rapid energy boost. “They also contain essential vitamins and minerals, including potassium, which aids in maintaining proper muscle function,” said Dr Kumar.",lifestyle
GenZ pop singer-songwriter Ridi Oswal on her journey: ‘Music always helped me express myself in ways that words couldn’t’,"Indie pop singer-songwriter Ridi Oswal loves developing music at the “intersection of Indian heritage and Western influences”. The 19-year-old’s pop melodies, such as Merry Go Round, and Happier, have had a dedicated fanbase, amassing over 65,000 monthly listeners on platforms like Spotify.
Her latest single is Guilty Feet, which she describes as a vibrant mix of self-love and an expression of women’s unapologetic desires. “Growing up as someone who was blessed enough to experience so many different beautiful cultures, I saw how some cultures (including the Indian culture) made girls especially feel ashamed of having certain desires and expressions. I believe a woman has a right to want to feel beautiful, strong, and independent, which is the whole crust of Guilty Feet, hence the word guilty, incorporating this Indian touch with tabla and sitar. I was hoping to empower young Indian women, of course, all women, as well. No one should feel ashamed of wanting self-expression and independence,” described Ridi.
Ridi, currently pursuing a degree in chemical engineering in London, feels “fusion music is a reflection of my own life” — a blend of Eastern and Western cultures. “Growing up with a rich Indian heritage while immersed in Western culture allowed me to appreciate and combine different musical styles. This blend feels natural to me; it’s a way to express my dual identity and connect with listeners who, like me, live between worlds. Music always helped me express myself in ways that words couldn’t,” Ridi said.Advertisement
Beginning her musical journey at around eight, Ridi attended a music academy in New York and was taught Jazz and Opera. “That’s when I knew that I wanted to continue in music. At 9, I attended a boarding school in Switzerland – this was not an easy experience; I couldn’t figure out at first how to balance all my passions, and I couldn’t figure out who I truly was. I was transferring schools a lot and couldn’t find my true voice, but music always felt permanent, and that’s when I found a true friend in songwriting and singing,” said Ridi.

By 17, Ridi released her first single, Top Guy. Recalling that she “finally felt that music was the correct path, ” Ridi said, “During the years I spent in Switzerland, I had a newfound appreciation for French music – which is why I deeply relate to fusion music. I’ve been blessed to have been able to live and appreciate so many different cultures,” said Ridi, looking forward to two more fusion singles, Let You Close and Love Till You Lose Me.
Meanwhile, Ridi also started an anti-bullying campaign page with her sister Vasundhara Oswal a few years ago to raise awareness through social media. “It’s about empowering individuals to stand up against bullying and fostering a culture of kindness and respect for all beliefs and values. The page is doing well with more than a dozen trending reels (shows even a concept as cliché as bullying can be turned into a positive force of action) and we hope to turn it into an NGO in the future,” said Ridi.
Addressing how social media is a “double-edged sword”, the GenZ singer mentioned that while such platforms offer a connection with fans, “it can also be overwhelming”.Advertisement

According to Khanna, raw turmeric is known for its potential health benefits. “It contains curcumin, a compound with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.

5 signs of boredom in your marriage and how to revitalise the relationship,"Every marriage experiences an initial honeymoon phase, where excitement permeates the air. Gradually, these passionate emotions may temper away with time, potentially leaving you feeling a bit indifferent or bored in your relationship. However, recognising the signs of boredom and taking proactive steps to address it is crucial for maintaining a healthy and fulfilling relationship.
“Signs of boredom in your marriage can be a gift if they are helping you notice you are going in a different direction in your marriage than you want to,” notes Julia Woods, a couples coach, in a recent Instagram post.
Here are five telltale signs that boredom might be knocking on your marital door and practical steps to reignite the spark:Advertisement
 Are you experiencing any of these signs in your marriage? (Source: Freepik)
1. Repetition in routine
If your marriage has fallen into a monotonous routine where each day feels indistinguishable from the last, it might be a sign of boredom. Woods cautions, “If you go out, do you go to the same restaurant? Do you talk about the same things?” Recognising these patterns is the first step toward rejuvenation.
2. Dwindling conversations
When discussions revolve around mundane topics or meaningful conversations start to dwindle, it could indicate a sense of boredom. Woods suggests asking yourself these questions: “Do those quiet moments in the car, at dinner, or amid life feel awkward? Do you long to connect in conversation but struggle to know how to start the conversation or what to talk about? Do you miss the ‘old’ days when you could easily talk for hours and not even realise it?”
3. Intimacy takes a backseat
A decrease in physical intimacy or a lack of interest in being close to your partner may point to underlying issues. Woods says if you need to think about the last time you had sex with your spouse or if it doesn’t excite you anymore, it’s a sign your marriage could be facing boredom.
4. Temptation by others
Woods warns that daydreaming about alternative scenarios or fantasising about a different life, questioning your choices, could subconsciously indicate a need for excitement and change. Additionally, feeling jealous of the way your friends and colleagues talk about their spouses and wishing your spouse was like theirs could be a sign.Advertisement
5. Neglecting quality time
If you actively avoid spending quality time with your partner or feel reluctance towards shared activities, it may show a lack of interest in the relationship. Woods notes signs such as not finding time for a date night or preferring to do things on your own.

To combat this boredom, Sidhharrth S Kumaar, relationship coach, NumroVani suggests the following steps:
1. Know yourself: While spending time together is crucial, maintaining individual interests and hobbies can invigorate your partnership, providing more discussion topics and enriching your connection.
2. Express the unexpressed: Small gestures of love and appreciation can make a significant impact. Strengthen your relationship by expressing your feelings through compliments, thank-you cards, or unexpected acts of kindness, creating a positive and nurturing atmosphere.
3. Revisit special places and activities: Rediscover the magic by revisiting places and activities that hold special memories for both of you. Nostalgia can reignite the emotional connection and remind you of the joy you once shared.
4. Plan joint activities: Break free from the monotony of everyday life by planning activities that interest both of you. Whether trying a new hobby together, embarking on a weekend adventure, or learning something new as a couple, shared experiences can create lasting memories and deepen your bond.Advertisement
5. Set common goals: Collaborate on setting common goals and aspirations for the future, fostering a sense of purpose as a couple and strengthening your commitment to supporting each other in achieving those goals.

"You might have computer vision syndrome if you have constant headaches, blurred vision","In our modern, fast-paced world, screens have seamlessly integrated into our daily routines. Whether we are working on computers, scrolling through social media on smartphones, or indulging in our favourite shows on tablets, the time spent in front of screens has increased manifold.
This increased screen exposure, however, brings with it a growing concern – digital eye strain, said Dr Rishi Raj Borah, country director, Orbis.
Also known as computer vision syndrome, it encompasses a range of eye and vision-related issues resulting from prolonged digital device use such as headaches, eyestrain, blurred vision, and dry eyes, he explained.Advertisement
As our reliance on screens continues to rise, it becomes imperative to adopt strategies to manage and minimise the impact of digital eye strain on our overall well-being.
The 20-20-20 Rule
When working on a desktop, ensure that your screen is at eye level, about an arm’s length away and that you are sitting in a comfortable, well-supported chair. Prolonged exposure to screens without breaks is a significant contributor to digital eye strain. The 20-20-20 rule proves invaluable in mitigating this strain: take a 20-second break every 20 minutes of screen usage and look at something 20 feet away. Incorporating this simple habit into your routine helps reduce eye strain and keeps your eyes refreshed. This can also be done by setting timers or using apps that remind you to take these regular breaks, ensuring your eyes get the rest they need.
Adjusting brightness
The brightness of your screens plays an important role in eye comfort. Adjust your device brightness to match your surroundings, avoiding both excessive and low brightness that can put a strain on your eyes. Besides, consider using dark or night mode in the evenings to decrease exposure to blue light, which has been associated with disrupted sleep patterns.

Blinking and eye moisture
Blinking, often overlooked, is crucial for maintaining eye moisture. Extended screen time can lead to reduced blinking frequency, resulting in dry and irritated eyes. Therefore, make a conscious effort to blink regularly as it keeps your eyes lubricated. If necessary, use artificial tears recommended by a healthcare professional to alleviate persistent dryness.Advertisement
Screen quality matters
Invest in high-resolution screens with anti-glare technology to minimise eye strain. Anti-glare filters can be added to existing screens, diminishing reflections and glare. Besides, regular eye check-ups are essential to address any underlying vision problems promptly.
Dr Sri Ganesh, chairman and managing director, Nethradhama Super Speciality Eye Hospital, Bangalore, recommended making subtle changes to our lifestyle to improve eye health and minimise the risks of developing eye disorders.
“Some tips would be to restrict screen time, work under optimum lighting conditions always, eat right for good sight, exercise regularly, get a good night’s sleep, do not smoke, use protective glasses, drink plenty of water, maintain eye hygiene and last but not the least, a periodic eye check-up or examination is an essential health check.”

What does your heart rate reveal about your health,"Think your heart rate is just a number on a fitness tracker? Think again! This seemingly simple statistic is actually a powerful window into your overall health and well-being. Just like the tempo of a song reflects its mood, the pace of your heartbeat tells a story about your body’s inner workings.
But what does that story mean? Can a faster beat signal danger, or is a slower rhythm something to celebrate?
Dr Ravinder Singh Rao, interventional structural cardiologist, emphasised that a healthy heart rate varies based on age, fitness level, and individual health conditions. “While 60-100 beats per minute (BPM) is a general guideline for adults, athletes may have lower resting rates due to their efficient cardiovascular systems.”Advertisement
However, he warned that personalised advice from a healthcare professional is crucial, as heart rates are unique to each individual.
The Silent Storyteller
Beyond numbers, your heart rate whispers tales about your inner workings. Dr Abhijit Khadtare, cardiologist at Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune, explained that an unusually high or low resting heart rate can signal potential health concerns.
“A consistently elevated rate might indicate stress, anxiety, or cardiovascular issues, while a very low rate could suggest bradycardia, where the heart struggles to pump effectively. Monitoring your heart rate during physical activity provides further insights into your cardiovascular fitness and overall health,” he noted in an interaction with indianexpress.com.
The Master Conductor
Dr Rao highlighted the heart rate’s critical role as a physiological indicator. It reflects the effectiveness of your cardiovascular system, directly impacting the delivery of oxygen-rich blood to vital organs and tissues. A balanced resting heart rate ensures optimal function and well-being throughout your body. Regularly monitoring your heart rate allows you to track fitness levels and maintain cardiac health.Advertisement

Beyond the Basics
Dr Khadtare pointed out that the heart rate plays a crucial role in medical examinations, helping diagnose potentially life-threatening conditions like arrhythmias. By understanding this vital sign, you can make informed lifestyle choices, such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, and stress management, to nurture your heart’s health. Remember, a well-regulated heart rate is key to optimal bodily function and reducing the risk of cardiovascular complications.

The Japanese excel at everything for a reason and it’s this,"Rooted in Japanese martial arts and deeply ingrained in Zen philosophy, the concept of Shu Ha Ri serves as a guiding principle for individuals on a journey of mastery and continuous improvement.
Originating from traditional disciplines such as Kendo and Aikido, Shu Ha Ri has transcended its martial arts origins to become a versatile framework applied across various domains.
What is Shu Ha Ri?

Shu (守): Embracing the Fundamentals

At the heart of Shu Ha Ri lies the foundational stage of “Shu,” which can be translated as “obey” or “protect.” During this phase, practitioners immerse themselves in the established techniques, forms, and principles of their chosen discipline.Advertisement
In broader contexts, the Shu stage extends beyond physical disciplines. In business, individuals in the Shu stage diligently follow established protocols and procedures, ensuring a thorough comprehension of the core principles guiding their roles.

Ha (破): Breaking Free and Innovating

As practitioners progress in their journey, they enter the “Ha” stage, which translates to “break” or “tear down.” This phase represents a departure from strict adherence to tradition and encourages experimentation and adaptation.
 In a corporate setting, professionals in the Ha stage question established norms, seek innovative solutions, and strive for continuous improvement. (Source: Freepik)
The Ha stage marks a transformative period where practitioners evolve from imitating established practices to creatively exploring new possibilities within the framework of their discipline.

Ri (離): Transcending Boundaries

The culmination of the Shu Ha Ri journey is the “Ri” stage, which translates to “separate” or “leave.” In this advanced phase, practitioners have internalized the principles to such an extent that they transcend the boundaries of their training.Advertisement
This stage represents a profound level of mastery where individuals contribute to the evolution of their discipline through innovation and creativity.
Importantly, the Ri stage does not signal the end of the journey. Instead, it embodies a commitment to continuous learning, acknowledging that even at the pinnacle of mastery, there is always room for growth and exploration.
How can you apply it to your life?
While Shu Ha Ri has its roots in martial arts, its adaptability has led to widespread application in diverse fields. In the business world, adopting the principles of Shu Ha Ri can foster a culture of continuous improvement, innovation, and employee development. Educators can utilise its framework to guide students through a structured learning journey that encompasses foundational knowledge and encourages creative exploration.
By embracing the stages of Shu Ha Ri, individuals embark on a transformative journey that moves beyond imitation to foster creativity, innovation, and a perpetual commitment to mastery in their chosen fields.",lifestyle
Do your ears pop in winter? This is why,"Ever felt that strange “pop” in your ears as you step outside on a brisk winter day? It’s not just you! That popping sensation is your body attempting to adjust to a sudden change in air pressure, and it happens more frequently in winter for a few intriguing reasons.
Dr Deepti Sinha, lead consultant, Dept of ENT at the CK Birla Hospital (R), Delhi, explained that our ears may pop in the winter because of changes in air pressure.
“Lower air pressure can result from cold temperatures, particularly in small areas like the middle ear. This difference in pressure affects the Eustachian tubes, which balance the pressure on each side of the eardrum. We feel a popping sound in our ears when these tubes are unable to control pressure,” she told indianexpress.com in an interaction.Advertisement
Additionally, middle ear fluid retention in the winter might be caused by the complications of past ear infections, which can result in ongoing popping and cracking sounds, Dr Sinha said. The need for appropriate ear care during the colder months is highlighted by the environment that seasonal pressure variations and leftover fluid generate, which makes ears more prone to popping.
How can you prevent this from happening?

To prevent persistent ear popping, timely consultation with an ENT specialist is crucial.
Regular examinations can take care of any underlying problems, making sure that infections are treated right away and don’t cause middle ear fluid to persist.
Pressure imbalances can be lessened by keeping your ears clean and limiting your exposure to sudden temperature changes. Maintaining hydration also helps with fluid balance.
Adjusting habits like yawning, chewing gum, or swallowing during flights or altitude changes might help to stabilise ear pressure and reduce the chance of pain and popping sensations.

What are some first-aid tips for this?
Inhaling steam is a simple first aid technique that works well for providing instant relief from earache, said Dr Sinha. Warm steam inhalation eases congestion and improves drainage, which eases pressure in the ears.
“To capture the steam, cover your head with a towel as you lean over the boiling water. Helping to open the Eustachian tubes, promotes pressure equalisation,” explained Dr Sinha.
Also, fast relief can be obtained with over-the-counter pain medicines. However, she warned that prolonged pain or symptoms require medical attention from a qualified provider, so speaking with one is crucial for a complete evaluation and the best course of action.Advertisement
What are the treatment options one can look at?
To treat infections or congestion, decongestants or antibiotics are often administered during outpatient department (OPD) visits for medical treatment of ear disorders. Antibiotics fight bacterial infections, while decongestants aid in edema reduction, Dr Sinha said.
Surgical procedures may be considered if medicine proves to be ineffective or if the problem continues. Surgical procedures, such as the insertion of ventilation tubes or correcting problems with the Eustachian tubes, are intended to correct structural disorders within the ear, she explained.
Yet, the decision between medication and surgical methods depends on the diagnosis and the seriousness of the ear ailment, highlighting the significance of expert advice in choosing the most efficient course of action.",lifestyle

What happens to your body if you eat mint leaves or pudina every day?,"Mint leaves, with their refreshing aroma and cool flavour, are a common addition to kitchens across the globe. But what happens when you incorporate them into your daily diet?
We explore the potential benefits and drawbacks of a daily mint habit, with insights from G Sushma, a clinical dietician at CARE Hospitals Banjara Hills Hyderabad.
Mint-ing a Regular Habit: Safety First
There’s no “one size fits all” answer to how much mint is safe daily. Most people tolerate moderate amounts well, whether sprinkled on salads, brewed into tea, or used as a culinary accent. However, exceeding this moderate intake can trigger side effects in some individuals. Remember, moderation is key.Advertisement
The Upside of Daily Mint
Digestive Delight: Mint has a long-standing reputation for aiding digestion and soothing tummy troubles. Its relaxing effect on the digestive tract muscles can ease indigestion and discomfort.
Fresher Breath, Naturally: Whether enjoyed raw or used in chewing gum, mint’s natural properties provide a breath-freshening boost.
Antioxidant Ally: Mint packs a punch of antioxidants, those helpful warriors that combat free radicals in the body.
Mental Minty Boost: The invigorating aroma of mint is believed to stimulate the brain, potentially enhancing alertness and cognitive function.Advertisement

The Downsides of Daily Mint
Heartburn Heartache: For some, mint can relax the lower esophageal sphincter, potentially increasing acid reflux symptoms.
Allergic Woes: Mint allergies, though less common, can cause skin reactions or other allergic symptoms in certain individuals.
GERD Got You Down?: Individuals with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) may experience worsened symptoms with excessive mint intake due to the sphincter relaxation effect.
Who Should Say No to Mint?
Little Tummies: Infants might find mint too strong, so caution is advised when considering its use in babies and young children.Advertisement
GERD Grievances: As mentioned earlier, individuals with GERD should be mindful of their mint intake to avoid aggravating symptoms.
Allergy Alert: Anyone with a known allergy to mint or related plants should steer clear.
Remember: Each person reacts differently to mint. What works for one might not be suitable for another. If you have specific health concerns, consult your doctor or a registered dietician for personalised advice on incorporating mint into your diet safely and effectively.

What happens when you take an ice bath for 8 minutes like Vidya Malavade?,"Celebrities have recently been embracing the ice bath trend that requires them to dip themselves in ice-cold water which is said to have numerous benefits for the body. Taking the trend one step ahead is actor Vidya Malavade who was seen taking an ice bath for a record time of eight minutes.
“I got over my fear. For a Mumbai girl who showers with hot water in peak summers and feels crazy cold to even enter a pool in the summers – I stayed in this ice bath for over 8 minutes…and it’s probably the most overwhelming thing I have done in the longest time!” shared Malavade.
Talking about the challenge, she shared that it was all about the breath – “deep inhales through the nose and long exhales through the mouth”.  She also listed some of the ice bath benefits.Advertisement
“Improved immunity .. cardiovascular health and muscle recovery, reduces inflammation. It allows your blood to rush towards the organs rejuvenating every cell, nerve, organ even blood making it super invigorating…and once you settle in the cold… it can be absolutely meditative and exhilarating together,” said Malavade.
Taking a cue, we decided to ask our in-house expert how the practice, often utilised in the realm of sports and fitness, has gained popularity, and what it means to ace it for eight odd minutes.
Notably, participants typically immerse themselves up to the neck or shoulders and remain in the cold water for a specified duration. It’s crucial to monitor the time spent in the ice bath, as prolonged exposure may lead to adverse effects such as frostbite or increased cardiovascular stress, experts urge.
While the specific effects can vary among individuals, several mechanisms may explain the perceived benefits of an 8-minute ice bath.Advertisement

One primary rationale behind cold exposure is its impact on inflammation and muscle soreness. When the body is exposed to cold temperatures, blood vessels constrict, reducing blood flow to the affected areas. “This constriction can help alleviate inflammation by limiting the influx of immune cells and reducing the production of inflammatory substances. Athletes and fitness enthusiasts often turn to ice baths as a post-exercise recovery strategy, aiming to minimise the muscle damage and inflammation induced by intense physical activity,” said fitness expert Garima Goyal.
According to Goyal, it is said to improve nerve functioning. “Exposure to cold triggers the body’s stress response, prompting the release of stress hormones like adrenaline. This physiological reaction may help improve circulation, increase alertness, and stimulate the production of endorphins—neurotransmitters associated with pain relief and feelings of well-being, said Goyal. “Consequently, individuals who incorporate ice baths into their routine might experience a mood lift and heightened sense of recovery,” said Goyal.
Is it for all?
While these proposed benefits are promising, it’s essential to consider individual variations in response to cold exposure. Factors such as age, fitness level, and overall health can influence how someone’s body reacts to an 8-minute ice bath. Additionally, caution is warranted for individuals with certain medical conditions, such as cardiovascular issues or Raynaud’s disease, as the extreme cold could exacerbate their conditions, said Goyal.
Alternatives such as contrast baths, which involve alternating between cold and warm water, are also explored by some individuals seeking recovery benefits without the intensity of a full ice bath.Advertisement
How much is too much?
The duration of an ice bath is a critical factor in balancing potential benefits with associated risks. Goyal said an optimal duration of around 10 to 15 minutes is said to be optimum as exceeding this timeframe may lead to several concerns like increased cardiovascular risk, frostbite, adverse effects on recovery, etc.

To ensure a safe and effective ice bath experience
Follow guidelines – Adhere to recommended guidelines, which typically suggest 10 to 15 minutes for an ice bath.
Monitor physical responses – Pay attention to how your body responds during the ice bath. If you experience severe discomfort, numbness, or unusual sensations, it’s crucial to exit the cold water immediately, said Goyal.
Gradual acclimatisation – If you are new to ice baths, start with shorter durations and gradually increase as your body becomes accustomed to the cold exposure, Goyal urged.
Individualised approach – Recognise that there is no one-size-fits-all approach, and individual tolerance levels should be taken into account.

While ice baths can offer benefits when done in moderation, exceeding recommended durations may pose risks to cardiovascular health and increase the likelihood of adverse effects. “Striking a balance and being mindful of individual factors is key to optimising the efficacy and safety of ice bath practices,” said Goyal.",lifestyle
‘It’s been transformational; enjoying the roller coaster ride’: Nandini Gupta on her journey as Miss India World 2023,"Last year, in April, Nandini Gupta was crowned Femina Miss India World 2023. Almost a year later, the 20-year-old says that the experience and the journey — during which she learned and unlearned many things — have transformed her as a person.
At present, with her target set on representing India on the Miss World 2025 stage, the beauty pageant winner from Rajasthan is “prepping up on all aspects to polish” herself.
She recently turned showstopper for Sahil Kochhar — looking resplendent in a vibrant red “bold and elegant” outfit from the designer’s ‘Amulya’ collection at the Festival of Hope Season 16. It is a fundraiser runway dedicated to supporting cancer patients by entrepreneur Shalini Vig.Advertisement
During the event, indianexpress.com reached out to her to learn more about her year, her inspiration, her take on beauty pageants, her biggest learnings so far, and how she managed the instant limelight her win put her under. Read the excerpts below:
It’ll soon be a year since you were crowned Miss India World 2023. How has the experience been?
Oh, well, yes! I can’t tell you how beautifully this year has transformed me. It has been a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I have unlearnt, relearnt, and in all, learnt so much. By meeting new people every day, I have created an amazing book of memories where every chapter unfolds a memory close to my heart.
What new things did your journey as Miss India World introduce you to?Advertisement

As I always say, this transformational journey introduced me to many life skills. I have also been fortunate enough to touch lives and get the chance to give my one bit to society, especially to the girls from my hometown, Kota, who look up to me as an inspiration. In all, I am enjoying this beautiful roller coaster ride.

If you were to be crowned Miss World, what changes would you want to bring within your capacity?


Just the thought of being crowned Miss World gives me comfort that I will be able to do so much for the people of the world. I would be able to live my dream of giving back as much as possible. To hug children who have no one but god and tell them that they have a sister to always count on. If I can do this then I would achieve my life motive.

At present, what does your diet, fitness, and beauty regime comprise?


I always try to keep it simple and less complex. As such, my diet is always a balance of everything in proper proportion. My workouts majorly comprise Pilates and dance. And beauty regime entails eating well and always letting aloe vera and rose water do the magic.

Beauty pageants have often been criticised — for favouritism, perpetuating unrealistic body and beauty standards, and also objectification. What is your take?

I think beauty pageants focus on all the aspects. In simple words, they empower you. If Miss India wasn’t a dream come true for me then I don’t think I would have been able to communicate well with people (considering my personality) or learn the art of giving and living.

How was the experience of walking the ramp at the Festival of Hope?

Festival of Hope was one of the most beautiful experiences I have encountered. Since I lost my aunt to cancer when my team told me that it was a cancer fundraising and Sahil Kochhar was doing it — it was an instant yes from my side.

What has been your biggest learning in the past year?

The day the crown sat on my head I promised it and to myself that I would be generous, humble, and be an open vehicle to learn. And, I think, that my biggest learning from the past year has been from all the things that were already around me — my crown just made me realise their value.Advertisement
Who inspired and motivated you to enter the world of pageantry?
My mother. She won a local pageant when she was 21 and was crowned Miss Madhya Pradesh. But the situations during her time didn’t allow her to join Miss India. So she has always been my inspiration; I am her creation and I always work hard to be her art.

"Narangi Maas: From royals to your kitchen, story behind Rajasthan’s culinary gem (recipe inside)","In winters, our fruit baskets overflow with the vibrant hues of fresh oranges. How do you typically enjoy this winter delight? Some relish it as is a refreshing glass of orange juice, while others embrace it in their fruit salads with a sprinkle of chaat masala.
But have you considered making a full meal with oranges? With a flurry of tourists and celebrities alike jetting off to Rajasthan, a dish called ‘Narangi Maas’ has captivated taste buds. Intrigued by its unique flavour, we decided to talk to chefs to know more about the Rajasthani delicacy.
History of Narangi Maas
Chef Aditi Dixit, CYK Hospitalities, tells indianexpress.com that Narangi Maas has an intriguing tale. “Renowned for its unique culinary traditions, the Rajput dynasty in Rajasthan is known for its laal maas, safed maas, and jungli maas. While jungli maas is produced with a limited number of ingredients and is intended for outdoor cooking, laal maas is a spicy lamb dish flavoured with Mathania chilli. In contrast to this, the less well-known but no less magnificent safed maas was made in the royal kitchens with unusual ingredients,” the chef said.Advertisement
In a similar vein, Narangi Maas originated from the royal household. “First of all, the word “narangi” means oranges, and the word “maas” means meat. Therefore, this Rajasthani meat recipe calls for the use of freshly squeezed orange juice. In contrast to other Rajasthani meat recipes, this dish is relatively new, according to the Royal Family of H.H. Raja Digvijaya Singh of Sailana. Raja Digvijaya Singh’s palace was home to numerous orange trees that produced an abundance of fruit. In order to prevent wastage, the royal chefs started using these oranges in their recipes, giving birth to the very unique Narangi Maas,” she added.
The dish was an instant hit and was quickly included into Rajasthani royal cuisine.
Here’s a recipe of Narangi Maas, courtesy chef Shipra Khanna:

7 winter season bedtime habits for healthy skin and hair,"When the air is chilly and dry, maintaining the health and nourishment of your skin and hair becomes paramount. Establishing essential bedtime habits is key to ensuring that you wake up with radiant and revitalised skin, and your hair in all its healthy glory.
Here are seven actionable habits to incorporate into your nighttime routine for optimal skincare and haircare, according to Dr Manasi Shirolikar, consultant dermatologist and founder of online consulting brand, drmanasiskin.com
1. Humidify Your Bedroom
As the cold weather sets in, the air indoors tends to become dry, which can take a toll on your skin and hair. Invest in a humidifier to add much-needed moisture to the air in your bedroom. This simple step prevents your skin and hair from drying out, promoting a healthier overall complexion.Advertisement
2. Gentle Cleansing
Opt for a mild, hydrating cleanser or cleansing lotion as part of your nighttime skincare routine. This ensures that you effectively remove makeup and impurities without stripping your skin of its essential oils. Gentle cleansing is especially crucial in the winter months when the skin tends to be more sensitive and prone to dryness.
3. Nighttime Skincare Routine
Develop a comprehensive nighttime skincare routine featuring products with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid and barrier-strengthening ingredients like ceramides. These components provide an extra layer of hydration, reinforcing your skin barrier while you sleep. For particularly dry skin you can go for products with shea butter, and oatmeal. Investing time in a proper nighttime routine contributes significantly to maintaining skin health throughout the winter season.

4. Don’t Forget Your Body
Extend your skincare routine beyond your face by applying body lotion on damp skin after bathing and before bed. Pay extra attention to areas prone to dryness and friction, such as elbows and knees. For an added boost, use a rich hand cream and wear cotton gloves overnight. This practice proves especially beneficial for restoring moisture to your hands, which are particularly susceptible to winter-induced dryness.
5. Hair Conditioning Treatment
Treat your hair to a conditioning session before bedtime by applying a leave-in conditioner. This nighttime treatment nourishes and repairs your hair while you sleep, leaving it more resilient and manageable. The winter season often leads to increased dryness and brittleness, making a conditioning treatment an essential part of your bedtime routine.Advertisement
6. Limit Hot Showers
While a hot shower may be tempting in cold weather, it can strip your skin and hair of their natural oils, leading to increased dryness. Opt for lukewarm showers to retain moisture and prevent unnecessary irritation, ensuring your skin remains balanced and well-hydrated.

7. Lip Balm Application

The lips are often overlooked during skincare routines, yet they are susceptible to drying and chapping, especially in winter. A nourishing lip balm keeps your lips soft and smooth, preventing discomfort associated with dryness.",lifestyle
Why you shouldn’t control the urge to pee?,"While travelling or in the middle of an important meeting, we may perhaps be not helping our bodies if we tend to control our urge to pee. Experts assert that it is essential to relieve yourself as it may cause health issues if you are habitual in controlling the body’s natural functions.
Imagine your bladder as a balloon. As it fills up with urine, it sends signals to your brain that it needs to be emptied. “Now, if you decide to hold it in, the bladder keeps expanding, putting pressure on its walls. It’s like blowing up a balloon beyond its recommended size – eventually, it might burst. In the case of your bladder, it won’t burst, but it can cause problems,” said Dr Ashutosh Baghel, consultant urologist, andrologist and kidney transplant surgeon, Wockhardt Hospitals Mira Road.
Nutritionist Leema Mahajan took to Instagram to share that it may make one prone to increased risk of UTI or Urinary Tract Infection, and may even increase the risk of bladder dysfunction.Advertisement
Concurred Dr Shobha Gupta, medical director, gynecologist, and IVF specialist from Mother’s Lap IVF Centre New Delhi and Vrindavan and shared that it can lead to UTIs as the urine that stays in the bladder for extended periods can provide a breeding ground for bacteria.
“UTIs can cause discomfort, pain, and potentially more serious complications if left untreated. Additionally, suppressing the urge to pee may lead to bladder dysfunction over time,” said Dr Gupta.
The body has a finely tuned system for eliminating waste. “Suppressing the urge to pee disrupts this natural process, potentially leading to imbalances in bodily functions,” said Dr Babina N M, chief medical officer, Jindal Naturecure Institute.
 Urinary incontinence can also happen (Source: Freepik)
Notably, the bladder is a muscle, and regularly ignoring the signals to empty it can result in weakened muscles and reduced bladder capacity. “This can contribute to issues such as incontinence, where you may struggle to control the release of urine. Furthermore, prolonged suppression of the urge to urinate can lead to distension of the bladder, causing discomfort and potential damage. In extreme cases, it may even result in a condition called urinary retention, where the bladder becomes unable to empty itself properly,” added Dr Gupta.Advertisement

Sometimes, if you make a habit of ignoring the urge to pee, your body might start misinterpreting the signals. “You might not feel the urge as strongly, and this can mess up your natural bathroom routine,” said Dr Baghel.
While there may be times when you must postpone using the restroom, it’s crucial to remember that consistently resisting the urge to urinate might have detrimental effects on your general health and well-being. “Maintaining your health requires paying attention to your body’s messages and listening to it. If you are having problems with your urination regularly, you should speak with a healthcare provider for specific recommendations and direction,” said Dr Babina.",lifestyle
People in the Blue Zones live upto a 100 years with this diet; try it for yourself,"Imagine living in a community where centenarians are commonplace, where vibrant life spills well past your 90s. This isn’t a utopian dream; it’s the reality for residents of the “Blue Zones,” regions scattered across the globe where people defy the odds and live exceptionally long, healthy lives.
Their secret? It’s not just genetics or luck. A significant piece of the puzzle lies in their unique diet, a treasure trove of wisdom passed down through generations. This dietary approach isn’t about restrictive fads or deprivation; it’s about embracing plant-based abundance, mindful choices, and simple, wholesome ingredients.
Did you know that the daily diet in most of the blue zone regions includes 90-95 per cent of plants? According to Ekta singhwal, dietician, Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, plant-based diets contribute to longevity by providing ample amounts of fibre, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. These nutrients help reduce inflammation, lower blood pressure, and improve heart health, ultimately extending life expectancy.Advertisement
Dr Aarif Hussian Bhat, senior consultant diabetologist and general physician, Ujala Cygnus Brightstar Hospital, added that the diet followed in blue zones offers diverse nutrients that support immune function, gut health, and overall well-being.
Explore the core principles that fuel longevity, from the power of plant-based proteins to the magic of single-ingredient meals. We’ll delve into the reasons behind limiting certain foods and discover the nutritional superstars that take center stage, helped by Dr Bhat and Singhwal.

Plant Power for a Long Life
Both experts emphasised the centrality of plant-based foods. These provide a wealth of fibre, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, reducing inflammation, lowering blood pressure, and promoting heart health. Think colourful fruits and vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and nuts.
Single-Ingredient Magic
Single-ingredient meals with raw, cooked, ground, or fermented foods are celebrated for their natural nutrient richness. This promotes optimal digestion, nutrient absorption, and overall health. They also help control blood sugar and manage weight.Advertisement
Limiting Indulgences
Dairy, sugar, meats, and fish are enjoyed sparingly in the Blue Zones. These foods may harbor saturated fats, cholesterol, and added sugars, potentially increasing the risk of chronic diseases. Opt for healthier alternatives wherever possible.
Protein Powerhouse
Beans are a staple in the Blue Zones, offering plant-based protein, fibre, and complex carbohydrates. These promote satiety, stabilise blood sugar levels, and support gut health, adding up to a healthier you.

Whole Wheat Wins
Sourdough or 100 per cent whole wheat bread is preferred over refined white bread. Packed with fibre, vitamins, and minerals, they aid digestion, provide sustained energy, and contribute to overall well-being. Remember, portion control is key!
Nuts: Nature’s Health Snacks
Nuts, brimming with heart-healthy fats, protein, fibre, vitamins, and minerals, are central to the Blue Zone diet. They reduce inflammation, lower cholesterol, and improve cardiovascular health, all contributing to a longer, healthier life.Advertisement
Remember, diet is just one piece of the puzzle. The Blue Zones also emphasise mindful practices like stress management, community support, and regular movement. By incorporating these principles into your lifestyle, you can take a step towards a longer, healthier, and more fulfilling life.",lifestyle
Trainer shares 4 habits that have helped him stay fit for over a decade; here’s what they are,"Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is a multi-faceted journey that requires attention to various aspects of well-being. In this exploration, we will delve into four key habits that contribute significantly to staying fit: beginning the day with movement, embracing sun exposure, prioritising family time, and incorporating daily reading. These morning rituals, as practiced by fitness trainer Rishab Telang, can create a comprehensive approach to health, addressing physical, mental, and social dimensions.
Begin the day with movement
According to Telang, front load the day with movement, preferably outdoors. “Even if you like working out in the evenings, get some movement done first thing in the morning. It can be a leisure walk, a few stretches or anything you like,” he said.
From a physical standpoint, it kickstarts the metabolism, setting the pace for calorie burning throughout the day. “Whether it’s a brisk walk, a short workout, or a yoga session, these activities enhance cardiovascular health, improve flexibility, and contribute to weight management,” said fitness trainer Garima Goyal.Advertisement
Beyond the physical benefits, morning exercise has profound effects on mental well-being. Engaging in physical activity releases endorphins, the body’s natural mood lifters, which can significantly impact one’s emotional state. This mood enhancement sets a positive tone for the day, reducing stress and anxiety. Additionally, morning exercise has been linked to improved cognitive function and better focus throughout the day. Goyal said that developing the habit of morning movement can be as simple as setting aside 20-30 minutes each morning for a workout routine or a brisk walk. The key is consistency; making it a daily ritual reinforces the habit and ensures that the positive effects compound over time, she added.
Sun exposure
Exposure to natural sunlight is crucial for maintaining optimal health, primarily due to its role in vitamin D synthesis. Goyal said vitamin D is essential for the absorption of calcium, promoting strong bones and a healthy immune system. “Sunlight exposure also plays a pivotal role in regulating the circadian rhythm, the body’s internal clock governing sleep-wake cycles,” Goyal mentioned.
Telang recalled his troubles with sleep for a “long time”. “One thing that really helped me was 10 minutes of meditation under the sun. Just 10-20 min would be enough, but get this done every day,” he said.
While the benefits of sun exposure are evident, it’s essential to practice sun safety. Spending time outdoors in the morning sunlight, when the UV index is generally lower, allows for vitamin D synthesis without excessive exposure to harmful rays. This practice contributes not only to physical health but also to mental well-being by positively impacting mood and promoting better sleep.Advertisement

However, it’s crucial to strike a balance, as excessive sun exposure without protection can lead to skin damage. “Sunscreen, protective clothing, and avoiding prolonged exposure during peak sunlight hours are essential precautions to maintain skin health while reaping the benefits of natural sunlight,” said Goyal.
Spending time with family and friends
Strong social ties have been associated with lower rates of depression, increased resilience to stress, and overall improved mental health. As such, Telang mentioned spending quality time with loved ones also helps with recovery, which allows you to work out much better.
Goyal mentioned engaging in shared activities with loved ones, whether it’s exercising together, sharing a meal, or simply spending quality time, fosters a sense of belonging and support. “Social interactions provide an avenue for emotional expression, reducing feelings of isolation and loneliness. Moreover, the emotional support derived from meaningful relationships contributes to stress reduction and enhances overall mental resilience,” said Goyal.
Reading
Telang shared that he reads a minimum of 10 pages every day. “I try to keep this very connected to the fitness domain, but ideally just read what you like. For me, this is the only habit that can help me upgrade my knowledge. I realised if I want to stay motivated to work or to workout, my morning rituals must include an element of study,” he said.

Cultivating a habit of daily reading is a powerful practice that nurtures mental fitness. Whether fiction or non-fiction, reading stimulates the brain, expands knowledge, and enhances cognitive function. Goyal described that reading requires focus and concentration, which exercises the brain’s neural pathways and contributes to mental sharpness. “Reading also provides a means of relaxation and escapism, allowing the mind to unwind from daily stressors. It offers a break from screen time and the constant barrage of digital information, promoting a more peaceful and contemplative state of mind,” Goyal said.Advertisement

How to deal with a difficult boss in the workplace,"In the ever-evolving professional world, encountering challenging relationships with managers is a shared experience. At some point or the other, many have to deal with the complexities of working with a difficult manager.
A 25-year-old PR professional, who worked with an ad tech startup in Gurugram for approximately eight months, said her colleagues in the office were “generally pleasant”.
“But my direct manager was not very friendly. Communicating with her was challenging, as she expected straightforward answers without seeking our opinions,” she recalled.Advertisement
She also said her former boss tended to “take professional matters personally and held grudges against people”. “The toxic environment led to the departure of around six employees during my time there,” she added.
A strategy consultant said he had “tough managers twice”. “The first time I was able to get along well with time… learned a few things and got a good exposure…but the second time that thing didn’t work out. I had to resign. So, no one method works for everyone,” he said.
Working with a difficult boss
If you have faced such a situation, know you’re not alone in navigating this professional challenge.
Working with a demanding manager can be trying — involving communication barriers, conflicting expectations, or a leadership style misaligned with your preferences. The impact of such challenges on your well-being and job satisfaction is undeniable, experts say.Advertisement
“It’s crucial to recognise that difficult manager-employee dynamics transcend industries, roles, and company sizes. Colleagues across diverse professional backgrounds share similar stories marked by frustration, stress, and the quest for solutions,” said Abhishek Joshhi, Founder, Strengths Masters.
However, behind professional titles, everyone is a person.
Kinds of difficult managers
Dr Harshil Shah, consultant psychiatrist, certified therapist and counsellor categorised difficult bosses into various kinds.
Short-tempered ones: They often tend to get irritable and lose their temper very easily, even on trivial issues. “They have difficulty controlling anger and would often burst out. The employees under them often tend to get quite overwhelmed due to frequent anger outbursts, which leads to them not being able to perform at their full potential,” said Dr Shah.
Passive-aggressive ones: They may not actively confront employees about their mistakes and would rather bottle up emotions and later lash out over some other issue. They may even taunt employees for the work not done well in the past, as these bosses were unable to convey their disappointment healthily when required.Advertisement

Submissive ones: They may not show any trace of anger or even assertion, even when required for proper functioning and the growth of the company. Such bosses may end up with huge losses, for themselves, the employees, and the company itself.
Cold-blooded ones: They may show no trace of emotion or humanity when it comes to the rights of employees. They may not allow them to take leave even in situations where it’s necessary. They would expect long working hours without taking any consideration of the toll it takes on the employee’s mental health or the compromise they make in their personal and family time.
The processor boss: They often are greatly difficult and expect you to perform at their level. The key to working with them is transparently examining what they need you to do — whether on a day-by-day, week-by-week, or month-to-month premise — and making a defined list of tasks that you simply can cross off as you go. They never think anyone’s doing “sufficient enough.”
Narcissist ones: Narcissist bosses make choices according to their selfish needs, without considering the individuals around them at work. They often adore bootlicking, which is the key to working with them. Attempt to compliment one of their thoughts to assist you in getting on their side.Advertisement
Communication styles of difficult managers
Dr Shah said managers may use several mechanisms to interact with employees.
Projection: The boss often projects their negative emotions, beliefs, or traits on someone else. Projection is often done to protect themselves from uncomfortable inner conflict and anxiety.
Displacement: This mechanism is a way for bosses to “displace,” or redirect, negative emotions from one source to another — usually from their superiors to employees working under them.
Other defences may include “acting out” and “passive aggression”.
Impact on employees’ mental health
Bosses play a crucial role in people’s mental health and job satisfaction. Toxic workplaces cause immense damage to family systems as well.Advertisement
These often tend to negatively impact the mental health of employees making them prone to depression, anxiety, adjustment issues, and insomnia (sleep disturbances), forcing them to compromise in family life, and affecting interpersonal relationships.
In severe cases, they may force employees to quit their jobs and suicidal ideations, said Dr Shah.
Mansi Poddar, psychotherapist, and founder, Heal. Grow. Thrive Foundation, said toxic bosses may exacerbate health conditions and long-term stress which is known to cause diabetes and blood pressure issues.
“A difficult boss creates feelings of helplessness and anxiety in employees. Over time, this leads to a loss of motivation, pleasure, and desire to work. This can often manifest as depression and low productivity in workers,” said Poddar.Advertisement
Finding a way out
Do not overwork at the cost of your own mental and emotional health, as it may negatively impact your physical health and family and interpersonal relationships in the long run, Poddar suggested.
When dealing with a difficult manager, seeking support from colleagues or mentors is invaluable. Sharing experiences and advice alleviates feelings of isolation and provides coping strategies for managing challenging professional relationships. Despite challenges, maintaining professionalism is key.
“Respond to difficulties with a calm and composed demeanour. If possible, learn to avoid reacting impulsively, and take a moment to gather your thoughts before responding,” said Joshhi of Strengths Masters.
Focus on proposing constructive solutions instead of solely dwelling on problems to bridge communication gaps or address specific issues.Advertisement
However, at times, people have no choice but to learn how to manage such a boss. Here are ways to navigate such bosses:
1) Make sure you are dealing with one before trying to fix your bad boss. Is there a reason for their behaviour, or are you being too hard on them? “Managers, like any individual, may face their own pressures and challenges. Realising this fosters empathy and opens doors to more effective communication,” said Joshhi.
2) Understanding why your boss does or cares about certain things can give you insight into their management style.
3) One of the challenges of unlikable people is that they come with equally unlikable behaviour—and it’s important to learn how to distance yourself from that behaviour.Advertisement
4) If your boss has anger management issues, identify what triggers their meltdowns and be extra careful about avoiding those.

5) At times you have no choice but to simply stand up to the boss and engage in conflict or contact a higher-up and change roles.
6) If possible, having an honest conversation might help. If the situation involves inappropriate behaviour or breaches of professional boundaries, clearly communicate your limits. “Establishing and enforcing boundaries is essential for maintaining a healthy work environment,” said Joshhi.

Can this nutrient-rich smoothie help prevent migraine? Experts weigh in,"Skipping breakfast is said to be a known trigger for migraine headaches. But can a nutrient-rich smoothie prevent it as claimed by nutritionist Kiran Kukreja? According to her, apart from lifestyle changes, essential nutrients in your food can help curb the migraine triggers. “Magnesium, zinc, calcium, and potassium help in curing migraines,” said Kukreja in an Instagram reel.
As such, she recommended a smoothie made of nuts like soaked almonds, walnuts, and poppy seeds which is then blended with cow’s milk.
How to prepare the smoothie?
Ingredients
5 no – Almonds, soaked
2 no – Walnuts
1 spoon – Poppy seeds
2 no – Pitted dates
150-200ml – Cow milk
MethodAdvertisement
*Soak 5 almonds, 2 walnuts, and one spoon of poppy seeds for 4-5 hours.
*After that, grind these soaked ingredients with 2 pitted dates and 150-200 ml of cow’s milk.
How to have it?
Kukreja recommended drinking this smoothie once a day (preferably in the evening).

According to Dr Dilip Gude, senior consultant physician, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad, supplementing a sumptuous breakfast with alpha lipoic acid, vitamins B3, B12, D, and coenzyme Q10 are known to improve the severity of migraine. “Antioxidant-rich seeds and nuts like almonds are known to have anti-inflammatory properties and help in curbing migraine attacks. Smoothies rich in the above-discussed nutrients if taken may prevent migraine attacks provided a balanced diet is followed,” said Dr Gude.

Dr Kumar said that people with migraine should be especially aware of trigger foods and should avoid them. This may include too much coffee, cheese, chocolates, cakes, Chinese food, etc. It is not that every migraine patient would have hypersensitivity to the same food items. So, it is essential for each migraine sufferer to identify which of the foods trigger their migraine attacks,” said Dr Kumar.",lifestyle
Skincare 101: How to use potato face pack,"Instant skincare remedies can help you save time and effort. A lot of such remedies are available on the internet. But do they suit all skin types? In our quest to find you the right one, we chanced upon this potato face pack, which promises to enhance your face glow and reduce acne and dark spots.
According to Shalini, a beauty blogger, the paste of potato, fuller’s Earth or Multani mitti, a few drops of lemon juice, and aloe vera gel can help your skin glow.
How to apply the paste?
Apply it with a brush or cotton.
Leave it on for 15 minutes
Wash it off after 15 minutes.
Does it work?Advertisement
While potato face packs are popular in skincare routines, their efficacy for addressing dark spots and acne may vary among individuals.
“Potatoes contain vitamin C, which can contribute to skin brightening and may help fade dark spots over time. Additionally, the natural enzymes in potatoes may have mild exfoliating properties, promoting cell turnover and potentially aiding in acne prevention,” said Dr Rinky Kapoor, consultant dermatologist, cosmetic dermatologist, and dermato-surgeon, The Esthetic Clinics.

Dr Meghna Mour, aesthetic dermatologist-trichologist-cosmetologist, laser specialist, and founder, Skuccii Supercliniq, potatoes are a natural source of skin-brightening ingredients such as potassium, vitamin C, catecholase enzyme, and Azelaic acid. “If applied regularly, these components can effectively diminish dark spots, hyperpigmentation, freckles, and tanning. Additionally, they can help reduce the appearance of dark under-eye circles,” said Dr Mour.
However, it’s crucial to approach potato face packs as a complementary measure rather than a standalone solution. “Dark spots and acne often require a multifaceted approach, including a consistent skincare routine, proper hygiene, and, if necessary, professional interventions such as prescribed topical treatments,” said Dr Kapoor.Advertisement
If you choose to use a potato face pack, ensure that it complements your overall skincare regimen and doesn’t irritate your skin.

"Does 24-hour fasting between meals help stop inflammation, illness?","Consumption of a high-calorie diet is associated with a chronic metabolic inflammatory syndrome (metaflammation), which is believed to be the root cause of many non-communicable diseases, “including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease”, according to neurologist Dr Sudhir Kumar, Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad.
Against this backdrop, researchers from Cambridge University recently conducted an interesting experiment, whereby they collected blood samples from volunteers who were made to consume a baseline meal of 500 Kcal, then fast for 24 hours, and then re-fed with 500 Kcal meals. The study noted that during fasting, levels of interleukin 1 beta were reduced and levels of arachidonic acid (AA) were elevated. In simple terms, these two biochemical changes are known to be responsible for reducing metabolic inflammation during the fasting state.
Dr Kumar concurred that fasting leads to suppression of metabolic inflammation, and is associated with a drop in serum proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1-beta.Advertisement
What happens during the fasting state?
Fasting for a day can have various effects on the body, such as affecting the way the body uses energy. Whether a person is fasting or not, the body still needs energy. “Its primary energy source is a sugar called glucose, which usually comes from carbohydrates, including grains, dairy products, fruits, certain vegetables, beans, and even sweets,” said Dr Ranga Santosh Kumar, consultant general physician and diabetologist, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad.
When glucose in the blood sufficiently meets the energy demands of the body, the liver and muscles will store some of the extra glucose in the form of glycogen and release it into the bloodstream whenever the body needs it.
However, during fasting, this process changes. “The liver will use the last of its glycogen reserves around 18 to 24 hours. At this point, the body enters into a state called gluconeogenesis, marking the body’s transition into fasting mode,” said Dr Santosh Kumar.

With no carbohydrates coming in, the body creates its glucose using mainly fat. Eventually, the body runs out of these energy sources as well. According to Dr Santosh Kumar, fasting mode then becomes the more serious starvation mode. “At this point, a person’s metabolism slows down, and their body begins burning muscle tissue for energy,” he said.Advertisement

Although it is a well-known term in dieting culture, Dr Santosh Kumar explained that true starvation mode occurs only after several consecutive days or weeks without food. “So, for those breaking their fast after 24 hours, it is generally safe to go without eating for a day unless other health conditions are present,” said Dr Santosh Kumar.",lifestyle

"Canvas to carry-ons: A tale of art, empowerment, and sustainability at India Art Fair","As you step into the world of the India Art Fair, your gaze is immediately captivated by the grand facade that beckons visitors and encourages them to pause and absorb the play of digital bars emitting vibrant pixels. A symbolic representation of our digital age, where everything is encoded, this spectacle sets the stage for an event beyond artistic expression, delving into sustainability and empowerment.
Amidst the chilly Delhi winters, the art fair emerges as a thaw, and what truly warms the soul is the trifecta of art, sustainability, and empowerment woven into the fabric of the fair’s facade. Crafted by the artistic duo Jiten Thukral and Sumir Tagra, the facade, New Delhi’s grandest canvas, holds more than just visual allure. As the curtains drew on the 15th edition of the art fair, it is set to undergo a metamorphosis, evolving into collectable tote bags made by Chamar Studio, an accessories brand run by artisans belonging to the Dalit community. It also trains leather workers to design eco-friendly bags.
Thukral and Tagra initially faced challenges with their recycling plan, leading them to opt for another solution: upcycling. “Initially, we wanted to avoid the use of plastic altogether. However, at the same time, there were some technical problems in changing the material to something else. But once we decided to proceed with the flex, I proposed that we can turn the entire design into chunks of bags,” says Tagra.Advertisement

At the largest art fair in India and arguably South Asia, evidenced by a record 108 exhibitors, even a single stride towards the environment will likely trigger significant repercussions. It is not just about scale, it is also about conscious steps towards a greater purpose, for art is, in today’s context, loaded with responsibility. As beautifully obscure as it is, it is also a response to the lived reality of our everyday lives. This rationale prompted the director of the art fair, Jaya Asokan, to collaborate with Chamar Studio.
While Jiten Thukral describes the partnership as a “natural choice,” Asokan emphasises its positive signalling, underscoring the importance of representation and inclusion.
“For us, inclusion is integral — it’s woven into our core values. Diversity, inclusion, and sustainability are paramount in every project we undertake. When selecting a studio, opting for a Dalit-run one was particularly appealing, as it not only aligns with our commitment to diversity but also highlights the talents of leather artists. Our decisions are consciously made to embrace diversity and inclusivity at every opportunity,” says Asokan.
Emerging from the Dharavi slums, Chamar Studio stands as a testament to creativity born from adversity, embarking on its artistic journey despite being initially labelled as ‘low-quality work’ and ‘unacceptable’.Advertisement
The founder of Chamar Studio, Sudheer Rajbhar, reflects on a time when navigating the art world demanded more than just talent, “To even enter galleries, you should speak fluent English and dress a certain and ‘appropriate’ way. I made my way up through all this.”
He says that the bags would be crafted by blending flex with rubber. Approximately five or six skilled artisans, mostly hailing from Dharavi, will aim to produce two bags daily once the facade is removed.
“Traditionally, leather workers have been undervalued for their craft. This is why I established Chamar – to instil a sense of respect in society for our artistry. The India Art Fair serves as the ideal platform for us,” Rajbhar says.
Thus, the bag will transcend its mere functionality to become a living testament to the resilience and creativity of its artists, with untold stories woven into every thread.Advertisement
“Through this bag, we’ll have a slice of their life which we could never experience,” says Bhuvan Arora, a visitor at the fair.
Repurposing the facade may seem like a solution, but it only prolongs the environmental harm caused by non-degradable materials, points out Rubina Rajan, a fair visitor. “With sustainability, the idea is to reduce the waste in the first place. Combining plastic with other materials can complicate decomposition and have long-term effects on the environment. You shouldn’t complicate waste further,” she affirms.
Meanwhile, another visitor, Brinda Singh, advocates a return to traditional Indian art practices that embraced sustainability, such as ‘madhubani’ and ‘pattchitra’, urging a rediscovery and incorporation of eco-friendly practices.
 Fair visitors Rubina Rajan and Brinda Singh
International art fairs, including prominent ones in Basel, Miami, Maastricht, and Hong Kong, increasingly acknowledge their environmental impact. The FIAC in Paris claims a 44 per cent waste recycling rate in 2019, while Art Basel implemented a carbon offsetting scheme during its Miami edition, as per artprice.com.Advertisement
Closer home, Asokan reveals that they previously repurposed the facade for homeless shelters and reused floors and walls at the fair for other events. The food court also has eco-friendly packaging, resulting in zero landfill waste last year.
The tote bags will be not only collector’s items and conversation starters but also symbols of conscious fashion. They will demonstrate that art and fashion can collaborate to create something beautiful, both aesthetically and ethically.",lifestyle
Trainer is impressed with Kareena Kapoor Khan’s backbend; know how to ace the yoga practice,"Flexibility and yoga go hand-in-hand. Demonstrating a glimpse of her flexibility, actor Kareena Kapoor Khan was seen acing Chakrasana or wheel pose, also called Urdhva Dhanurasana. The Jaane Jaan actor’s yoga trainer Anshuka Parwani shared a glimpse of Kareena’s yoga practice.
“Backbends with Bebo @kareenakapoorkhan. Bebo, your discipline, your Yoga journey, the ease with which you gracefully slide into an asana – it’s inspiring,” said Parwani.
What makes backbends so powerful and crucial in one’s journey?Advertisement
Backbends hold a significant place in the realm of yoga, not only for their physical benefits but also for their profound impact on the mind and spirit. “These dynamic postures, characterised by an extension of the spine, have been revered for centuries in various yogic traditions,” said fitness expert Garima Goyal.
Backbending postures extend the spine in ways that counteract the forward flexion that dominates many modern lifestyles, where prolonged sitting and hunching over electronic devices contribute to poor posture and limited spinal mobility. Goyal described that through consistent practice of backbends, individuals can enhance the flexibility of the spinal column, promoting a healthier range of motion. “This increased flexibility extends to the intervertebral discs, muscles, and ligaments surrounding the spine. As the spine becomes more supple, practitioners may experience relief from stiffness and discomfort associated with sedentary activities,” said Goyal.
Additionally, improved spinal flexibility can have a positive impact on nerve function, promoting better communication between the brain and various parts of the body.
In addition, the practice of backbends encourages practitioners to cultivate mindfulness and presence on the mat. “The deep concentration required to execute these poses demands a focused awareness of the breath, alignment, and sensations in the body,” Goyal mentioned.

How to do them properly?Advertisement
Performing backbends properly requires attention to alignment, engagement of specific muscles, and a gradual approach to avoid injury.
Here are general guidelines for practicing backends safely and under guidance
1. Warm-up – Start with a gentle warm-up to prepare your body. Focus on dynamic movements, such as cat-cow stretches and gentle twists, to awaken the spine. Gradually progress to more targeted warm-up poses like Cobra or Bridge Pose, said Goyal.
2. Core engagement – Strengthen your core muscles to provide stability and support for the spine during backbends. Engage the abdominal muscles to protect the lower back and prevent excessive compression in that area.
3. Gradual progression – Begin with milder backbends and progress gradually to deeper poses. This approach allows your body to adapt and become more flexible over time. Avoid forcing your body into extreme positions, especially if you’re a beginner, stressed Goyal.
4. Alignment – Focus on proper alignment to avoid strain on the spine and other joints. In poses like Urdhva Dhanurasana, ensure your hands are placed shoulder-width apart, and the fingers point toward the shoulders. Keep the feet parallel and hip-width apart, distributing the weight evenly, mentioned Goyal.
5. Shoulder mobility – Open the shoulders by stretching and strengthening them. This is crucial for poses like wheel pose. “Practice shoulder stretches and exercises to improve flexibility and prevent excessive tension,” said Goyal.
6. Hip flexor stretching – Many backbends require hip flexibility. Incorporate hip flexor stretches to create openness in the front of the hips. Lunges and Pigeon Pose can be beneficial for releasing tension in the hip flexors.
7. Back strength – Strengthen the muscles along the spine, including the erector spinae, through targeted exercises. Poses like Locust Pose can help build strength in the muscles of the lower back.
8. Breath awareness – Maintain steady and conscious breathing throughout the practice. Deep, controlled breaths help release tension and support the body in challenging backbends.
9. Props – Use props like blocks or a bolster to support your practice, especially if you’re working on more advanced backbends. Props can provide additional stability and make the poses more accessible.

10. Listen to your body – Pay attention to how your body feels during and after each backbend. If you experience pain beyond the sensation of stretching, modify the pose or seek guidance from a qualified yoga instructor.
11. Cool down – Include a cool-down sequence with gentle forward folds and twists to balance the spine after back bending.",lifestyle

Have flaxseed rice in your diet; here’s why,"The numerous variations of rice in India are no less than mindboggling and indescribably tasty too. From dependable curd rice to dal rice and rajma chawal, the variety is endless. One such lesser-known variety but a popular one in Bihari households is Tisi Bhaat or Flaxseed Rice made with powdered flaxseeds offering a nutty flavour.

Dermatologists answer frequently asked queries around anti-ageing skincare,"In a world where the pursuit of youthfulness is a timeless quest, the skincare industry has become a vast landscape of serums, creams, and treatments promising to turn back the clock. Navigating this terrain leaves consumers inundated with a myriad of questions about the efficacy, safety, and necessity of anti-aging practices. Recently, Dr Aanchal Panth, a dermatologist, took to Instagram to share a few commonly asked questions about an anti-ageing skincare and answers to all your queries.
1. Does skin get drier with age?
Answering in affirmative, Dr Panth said that with age the oil forming glands shrink in size and the water holding capacity of the skin goes down, making thicker moisturisers a key part of an anti-aging skincare routine.
To address dry skin associated with aging, it’s important to adopt a skincare routine that focuses on hydration and moisture retention. “This may include using mild, gentle cleansers, incorporating moisturisers with ingredients like ceramides, glycerol and hyaluronic acid, and avoiding double cleansing on a regular basis,” Dr Seema Oberoi Lall, consultant, dermatology, CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram, told indianexpress.com.Advertisement
Additionally, staying well-hydrated by drinking enough water and avoiding excessive sun exposure can contribute to overall skin health, advised Dr Pooja Aggarwal, consultant- dermatology & cosmetology, Artemis Hospital, Gurgaon.
2. Are facial oils necessary?
Dr Panth recommended opting for a good moisturiser over facial oil. However, for those who prefer using oils, she suggested trying squalene, known for being non-comedogenic and soothing.
On the other hand, Dr Lall said that facial oils can provide intense hydration and help seal in moisture, giving dry and ageing skin the much-required nourishment and lubrication. When incorporating facial oils in your routine, it’s important to do a patch test and introduce the oil gradually to see how your skin responds. “Do not use mustard or similar oils with strong fragrances. Some of them can be occlusive if used for long hours. It is best to use these oils before bathing,” she suggested.
3. Does an effective skincare routine have to be expensive?
“Absolutely not,” said Dr Panth, adding that “you can build a simple skincare routine which is effective”. All you need to do is understand your skincare goals and treat only one or two concerns at a time.Advertisement
Similarly, Dr Lall said that many pharmaceutical grade products are available as cleansers, moisturisers and night creams at competitive pricing at pharmacies. “Your dermatologist can help you choose the best products tailored to your skincare needs.”
Dr Aggarwal urged to not to use any product on your skin just because it is expensive. “Expensive does not mean better,” she said.
4. Are hydrating serums important for nighttime skincare routines?
Dr Panth said that hydrating serums help in keeping skin moisturised for longer, especially if you have dry skin. Agreeing, Dr Lall explained that nighttime provides a long, uninterrupted time for products to get absorbed, so hydrating serums are a good idea during nights.
“Snail mucin, hyaluronic acid and ceramides, are ingredients I look for in serums for nighttime,” Dr Panth recommended.Advertisement

5. Should we increase the strength of retinol after every 6 months?
While Dr Panth deemed it unnecessary, Dr Aggarwal suggested to wait for at least 6-8 weeks before increasing the strength of retinol in your skin care routine. “While there is no specific time period when it comes to increasing the strength of retinol, it depends on how the skin responds to the retinol treatment,” she said.
Consult a dermatologist regarding the use of retinol and the duration after which its strength must be increased in the skincare routine.

"Handy tips for bloating, gas relief","Many of us struggle with digestive disorders like gas and bloating post meals. While a timely remedy may aid, the solution, experts urge, lies in long-term dietary tweaks. Nutritionist Nmami Agarwal took to Instagram to share how experiencing excessive gas and flatulence can be uncomfortable, but making dietary adjustments can contribute to relief.
She also shared a list of items one needs “to remove from your breakfast and why”.
Excess coffee, tea, especially with milk
Coffee and tea, particularly when consumed in excess, can be acidic and may stimulate the production of stomach acid, leading to increased gas. “Milk can contribute to lactose intolerance, causing digestive issues. Consider substituting with herbal teas or limiting coffee intake,” said Agarwal.
Cauliflower and cabbageAdvertisement
Cruciferous vegetables like cauliflower and cabbage contain complex carbohydrates that are challenging to digest, leading to gas production. Limit their intake, or opt for alternative vegetables like spinach or zucchini, said Agarwal.
Apples and pears
These fruits are high in fructose and fibre, which can cause bloating and gas. “Try replacing them with low-fructose fruits like berries or melons for a gentler impact on digestion,” said Agarwal.
Raw cucumber and onions
Raw vegetables, especially those with high fibre content like cucumber and onions, may be difficult to break down, causing gas. Consider cooking or opting for cooked vegetables like steamed carrots or bell peppers, mentioned Agarwal.
Corn
Corn contains cellulose, a type of fibre that can be challenging for the digestive system. “If corn triggers discomfort, replace it with alternative grains like quinoa or rice,” said Agarwal.Advertisement
Intestinal gas is a normal part of digestion. But excessive gas and flatulence can be caused by lactose intolerance, certain foods, or a sudden switch to a high-fibre diet, said Dr Vikas Jindal, consultant, Dept of Gastroenterology, CK Birla Hospital, Delhi.
According to Mohini Dongre, nutritionist, Narayana Hospital Gurugram, the removal of items like excess coffee, cruciferous vegetables, high-fructose fruits, raw vegetables, and corn from breakfast can significantly alleviate digestive discomfort. “These foods contribute to increased gas production and may be challenging for some individuals to digest,” said Dongre.
Flatulence can be a symptom of some digestive system disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome, said Dr Jindal.
What can be done?
Ease those morning discomforts by reconsidering your breakfast choices. Opt for a morning meal that sidesteps the usual suspects known to stir up excess gas and flatulence. “While high-fibre cereals, beans, and lentils are rich in nutrition, their fibre and complex carbohydrates can sometimes lead to unwanted gas/flatulence. People should watch out for cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower, as well as high-lactose dairy products, as they might cause stomach problems,” said Dr Jindal.Advertisement
Dongre mentioned that substituting with alternatives like herbal teas, spinach, low-fructose fruits, and cooked vegetables provides a gentler impact on the digestive system.
Avoid consuming too many fried and oily foods and keep an eye out for artificial sweeteners in sugar-free items. “Carbonated beverages add more air to your stomach, and fructose, which is found in some fruits like pears and apples, can make you feel bloated,” described Dr Jindal.

Additionally, be cautious with processed breakfast foods and high-sugar options, as they may contribute to digestive distress. “Everyone’s tolerance is a bit different, so it’s wise to consult with a healthcare professional or dietitian for personalised advice based on your unique needs and health conditions. With a few mindful tweaks to your breakfast routine, you could bid farewell to excessive gas and start your day on a much more comfortable note,” Dr Jindal said.
Moreover, strive to promote overall digestive health by staying adequately hydrated, chewing food thoroughly, and incorporating probiotic-rich foods, Dongre said.

How fruits help you deal with constipation,"Constipation can be a major issue for many owing to issues with their digestive system, seasonal changes, or diet tweaks. One of the remedies suggested for constipation is eating fibre-rich foods like fruits. Do fruits work, and which kind? Here’s what we found.
Dr Dilip Gude, senior consultant physician, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad told indianexpress.com that incorporating fruits into your diet can be an effective and natural way to deal with constipation. “Fruits are rich in dietary fibre, water, and various nutrients that promote digestive health and regular bowel movements,” said Dr Gude.
High fibre content
Fruits, especially those with high fibre content, play a crucial role in preventing and relieving constipation. “Fibre adds bulk to the stool, making it easier to pass through the digestive tract. Soluble fibre, found in fruits like apples, pears, and citrus fruits, forms a gel-like substance that helps soften the stool. Insoluble fibre, prevalent in fruits such as berries and kiwi, adds bulk and accelerates the movement of stool through the intestines,” said Dr Gude.
Natural laxativesAdvertisement
Some fruits act as natural laxatives, aiding in bowel regularity. Prunes and prune juice, for example, are well-known for their natural laxative effect due to their sorbitol content, which helps soften stools and promote bowel movements. “Additionally, kiwi contains a proteolytic enzyme called actinidin, which can enhance bowel function,” said Dr Gude.
Hydration
Many fruits have high water content, contributing to overall hydration. “roper hydration is essential for maintaining healthy bowel function. Water helps soften the stool and facilitates its smooth passage through the intestines. Water-rich fruits like watermelon, cucumber, and oranges can be particularly beneficial in preventing dehydration-related constipation,” said Dr Gude.

Electrolyte balance
Bananas, a rich source of potassium, can help maintain electrolyte balance. “Potassium is essential for proper muscle function, including the smooth muscles in the digestive tract. Ensuring an adequate intake of potassium-rich fruits can support bowel regularity,” said Dr Gude.

"You only need 22 minutes of exercising daily to cut death risk from prolonged sitting, say scientists","In recent years, office workers forced into extended periods of sitting have been bombarded with alarming headlines about the dire consequences of this inactivity, suggesting even regular exercise couldn’t fully mitigate the damage.
However, a study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine offers a beacon of hope, finding that as little as 22 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity a day can counter the ill effects of prolonged sitting. Moreover, the researchers discovered a decrease in the risk of premature death from any cause as a person’s activity level increases.
What does the research say?
According to the study’s lead author, Edvard Sagelv, a researcher at The Arctic University of Norway, the current recommendation of 150 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous activity “is sufficient to offset the detrimental health effects of prolonged sitting.” Quoted by NBC News, he elaborated, “The beauty of this is that we’re talking about activities that make you breathe a bit harder, like brisk walking, gardening, or tackling a hill.”Advertisement
Seeking to determine whether physical activity could affect the relationship between sedentary time and mortality, the researchers investigated the amount of activity and sitting time necessary to influence this risk.
Their findings revealed a decline in the risk of death with increased physical activity. Among those who sat for less than 10½ hours daily, an extra 10 minutes of activity translated to a 15 per cent lower death risk, while for those exceeding 10½ hours of daily sitting, the risk reduction jumped to 35 per cent.

Why is prolonged sitting associated with a high risk of death?
Dr Sanjay Kumar, general physician, Cygnus Laxmi Hospital, explained that prolonged sitting increases the risk of death due to its association with several adverse health outcomes, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer.
“When you sit for extended periods, your muscles are inactive, leading to decreased metabolism, poor blood circulation, and increased inflammation, all of which contribute to higher mortality rates,” he added.Advertisement
Exercise helps decrease the risk of death associated with prolonged sitting by counteracting its negative effects on the body, according to Dr Kumar, who said that regular physical activity strengthens muscles, improves circulation, boosts metabolism, and reduces inflammation. “Engaging in exercise, such as brisk walking, jogging, cycling, or strength training, helps offset the harmful effects of sitting for long periods, promoting overall health and longevity.”
What can you include in your 25 minute workout routine?
According to Joel Arun Benjamin, professional track field athlete and fitness trainer, India has one of the highest burdens of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) worldwide.
“Brisk walking for 15 minutes can help us to take down the risk of CVD. Along with 15 minutes of strength training at least twice a week is most important thing which every human being should must do it, specially after the age of 30,” Benjamin explained in an interaction with indianexpress.com.
Human body starts losing lean muscles after the age of 30th by 8 per cent per decade, said Benjamin, adding that by the age of 60 that percentage gose upto 15 per cent per decade and he recommnded strength training to prevent this.Advertisement

What happens to your body if you sleep after midnight every day?,"The allure of the midnight hour, with its quietude and serenity, often beckons in a world where our days seem to extend far beyond the conventional nine-to-five. (It’s called revenge bedtime procrastination) Yet, the habit of consistently sleeping after midnight may conceal more than just nocturnal tranquillity; it might cast shadows on our long-term health.
Dr Dilip Gude, senior consultant physician, Yashoda Hospitals Hyderabad, noted that sleeping very late every day can not only cause a cascade of stress and metabolic issues but is also linked with various mental health disorders such as increased anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorders.
“The natural repair cycle that occurs during sleep is hampered when people sleep late. Over all life span is decreased in those that are chronically sleep deprived and go to bed later, ” Dr Gude explained in an interaction with indianexpress.com. Advertisement
What are the long-term problems you may face?

Disrupted circadian rhythms: Regularly sleeping after midnight can disrupt the body’s natural circadian rhythms, affecting the regulation of essential functions such as hormone release, metabolism, and body temperature.
Impaired cognitive function: Prolonged late-night sleep may impair cognitive functions, leading to difficulties in concentration, memory retention, and overall mental alertness.
Increased stress hormones: Late-night sleep is linked to elevated levels of stress hormones like cortisol, potentially contributing to increased stress, anxiety, and even weight gain.
Compromised immune function: Chronic sleep deprivation weakens the immune system, making the body more susceptible to illnesses and infections.
Metabolic consequences: Sleeping post-midnight may disrupt the body’s metabolism, potentially contributing to weight gain, insulin resistance, and an increased risk of metabolic disorders.

Sleeping late is known to decrease the amount of sunlight exposure during the day, which affects overall mental and physical well-being causing poor focus and impaired memory, along with inhibited learning, said Dr Gude. You might also be at risk of an increased level of cholesterol and hypertension, he added.

How can you combat these problems?

Establish a Consistent Sleep Schedule: Cultivate a routine by going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends, to regulate your body’s internal clock.
Create a Relaxing Bedtime Ritual: Develop calming pre-sleep rituals such as reading, gentle stretching, or meditation to signal to your body that it’s time to wind down.
Limit Exposure to Screens: Reduce exposure to electronic devices with screens at least an hour before bedtime, as the blue light emitted can disrupt melatonin production.
Mindful Nutrition: Be mindful of late-night snacks, opting for light and easily digestible options. Avoid heavy meals close to bedtime to promote better sleep quality.
Prioritise Quality Sleep: Ensure your sleep environment is conducive to rest, with a comfortable mattress, supportive pillows, and a dark, quiet room. Invest in creating a soothing sleep sanctuary.

By incorporating mindful sleep practices into our nightly routine, we can transform our sleep into a rejuvenating and health-promoting experience.

Do you experience bloating with pomegranate juice? Here’s what to consider,"If you find yourself experiencing bloating after consuming pomegranate juice, you’re not alone. While pomegranates offer various health benefits, including cooling the stomach, treating acidity, addressing stomach ulcers, and stopping diarrhoea, excessive intake may lead to bloating, particularly in individuals prone to constipation and dry, hard stools, said Sushma PS, chief dietitian, Jindal Naturecure Institute.
According to Sushma, this bloating effect is attributed to the astringent property of pomegranates, which can increase Vata or air and space in the gut.
Why does bloating happen?
Ushakiran Sisodia, registered dietician and clinical nutritionist, diet and nutrition, Nanavati Max Super Speciality Hospital said in an earlier interview that bloating occurs due to the build-up of gas in the digestive system, often caused by consuming foods that are difficult to digest. “Bloating and indigestion are common among Indians due to our food choices — spicy, oily, astringent foods, wheat-based foods, and legumes,” she said. To avoid bloating, it is important to choose foods that can be digested and metabolised easily by the body or have them with certain dietary additions to neutralise their astringent effects.Advertisement

Some ayurvedic experts suggest that there are practical steps you can take to alleviate this discomfort. According to Dr Alka Vijayan, Ayurveda thyroid expert, one effective approach is to first try to add a handful of black raisins to pomegranate juice or add a pinch of powdered black salt. Both these remedies can take care of the bloating or flatulence, she said.

Your ultimate guide to in-flight skincare,"As you embark on your next long-haul flight, don’t let the dry, recycled cabin air dull your glow. Maintaining a skincare routine at 30,000 feet may seem challenging, but with a few expert tips, you can step off the plane looking as refreshed as when you boarded.
But first, let’s understand the common skin concerns people face during flights.
Dr Seema Oberoi Lall, consultant in dermatology at CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram, explained that long-haul flights present specific challenges to skin health, primarily due to the filtered and recirculated air in the cabin.Advertisement
“This environment tends to be drier, leading to dehydration concerns for passengers. Additionally, the enclosed space and the sheer volume of people contribute to stagnant air, especially during extended flights exceeding six to eight hours. This recirculated air may harbor various pathogens, germs, and allergens, posing a risk for those prone to allergies who might experience breakouts,” she added.
So, how can you keep your skin healthy? Recently, Aashi Adani, a beauty blogger, took to Instagram to share a few in-flight skincare tips.

Never wear makeup, especially on a long flight, as it can clog your pores.
Flights tend to make the skin very dry, so carry a mist to hydrate your skin throughout the journey.
Carry a sheet mask to get that extra hydration. Additionally, the leftover serum can go on your hands and neck.
Always wear SPF. When we are at such a height, even one hour of exposure to the sun gives the same amount of radiation as 20 minutes on a tanning bed.
Always make sure to keep the windows closed as much as possible.
Carry any lip balm to keep your lips hydrated.

Adding to this, Dr Lall said, “It’s essential to drink an ample amount of water to keep your skin well-hydrated. Don’t forget the delicate under-eye area—applying a specialised cream can keep your eyes refreshed, combating the tired look that often accompanies long flights.”
For those prone to acne, steer clear of greasy products, as breakouts can be triggered after extended travel. “Opt for oil-free moisturisers, especially if you have oily-prone skin, to maintain a healthy complexion throughout the journey,” Dr Lall added.

Once you disembark from the flight, consider taking a refreshing bath and changing your clothes. “Airports and flights expose travelers to a plethora of allergens, given the convergence of individuals from around the globe, each carrying their unique set of allergies and germs. These closed environments, sustained for extended periods, aren’t the most conducive to skin health. Therefore, it’s advisable to prioritise personal hygiene—cleanse yourself, take a bath, and change into fresh clothing upon reaching your destination,” she concluded.",lifestyle
When can women opt for water births,"Many pregnant women across the globe are turning towards water births as an option for delivery due to its promise of a painless and comfortable experience, in contrast to the excruciating pain faced during traditional deliveries. “As the name denotes, water birth refers to the process of labour and delivery that occurs in a tub of warm water, usually in a hospital or birthing center,” says Dr Neelam Suri, a senior consultant, obstetrician, and gynecologist at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, New Delhi, in interaction with indianexpress.com.
Dr Suri adds that water acts as a cushion to provide comfort, buoyancy, and hydrostatic pressure during contractions. “It is good for the first stage of labour,” however, she explains that the actual delivery requires more precautions, making safety a potential challenge.
So, who should opt for water births?
Dr Anjana Singh, director and HOD of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Fortis Hospital, Noida, explains that only low-risk pregnancies are suitable for water births. “The foetus should be between 37 to 41 weeks, with the baby’s head positioned downward and adequate amniotic fluid.”Advertisement
Water births are only recommended for healthy-term pregnancies, starting from 37 weeks onwards. “Preterm deliveries can face difficulties in thermoregulation, respiration, and neonatal complications. Women with complex medical histories involving risks like infection, bleeding disorders, or placental issues are better served by conventional delivery protocols,” says Dr Suri. Additionally, preterm pregnancies or women with previous caesarean sections should not opt for water births.
Listed below are benefits of water births as shared by Dr Singh:

A more satisfying experience of labour
Less requirement for epidural
Shortens labour duration
Lesser required episiotomy (a surgical procedure)

However, such benefits warrant careful evaluation of individual risks.
“Lower genital tract infections can be exacerbated due to prolonged water exposure. Maintaining optimal water temperature outside the normal core body range also brings challenges. Dehydration and overheating from immersion pose concerns. Furthermore, babies risk aspirating water if incorrectly handled during delivery or resuscitation. Pelvic floor functioning may also be weakened due to the extra buoyancy,” says Dr Suri.Advertisement
Meanwhile, water births necessitate skilled personnel and additional infrastructure for infection control, emergency interventions, and neonatal management linked with water births, thereby restricting its availability across regions. Intermittent foetal heart rate monitoring is also recommended given the possibility of decompensation (organ failure).

Ultimately, an informed decision must balance the promised comforts of a water birth against one’s personal medical needs and risks. “Open discussions with providers are key to determining suitability. While not universally recommended, it can offer a satisfactory birthing experience for many low-risk pregnancies when undertaken cautiously,” Dr Suri concludes.",lifestyle
Eating almonds may help reduce wrinkles and uneven skin tone? Experts weigh in,"While some suggest that incorporating almonds into your daily diet may have potential benefits for skin health, including the reduction of facial wrinkles, experts urge it’s important to approach such claims with a balanced perspective.
Citing research by the University of California (UC), phytonutrient chemist Dan Gubler said eating half a cup of almonds daily in place of typical calorie-matched snacks may be an effective means of improving the appearance of facial wrinkles and skin tone, especially among postmenopausal women with Fitzpatrick skin types I and I.
We decided to ask our in-house experts whether almonds can prevent wrinkles. Before we dive into what they had to tell us, here’s what to know about the benefits of almonds.
Why have almonds?Advertisement
As we all know, almonds are a good source of vitamin E, antioxidants, and healthy fats, essential for maintaining your health. “Antioxidants help protect the skin from oxidative stress, and vitamin E contributes to skin hydration,” said skin expert and cosmetologist Dr Geetika Mittal Gupta.
Agreeing, Saranya U, dietician and nutritionist, HCL Healthcare said almonds are packed with essential nutrients that promote skin health and combat the signs of ageing. “They are rich in vitamin E, a powerful antioxidant known for its ability to neutralise free radicals that can damage skin cells and lead to premature ageing. By fighting oxidative stress, vitamin E helps maintain the elasticity and suppleness of the skin, reducing the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines,” said Saranya.
Moreover, almonds contain healthy fats, such as omega-3 fatty acids and monounsaturated fats, which help nourish the skin from within, keeping it hydrated and plump. “These fats also support the skin’s natural barrier function, protecting it from environmental aggressors and retaining moisture,” said Saranya.
According to Saranya, in addition to their skin-loving nutrients, almonds are also a good source of protein, which is essential for collagen production—the protein responsible for maintaining skin structure and firmness.
How to have them?Advertisement
Including half a cup of almonds in your daily diet can be as simple as enjoying them as a snack, adding them to salads, or blending them into smoothies, mentioned Saranya.
Is it a foolproof way to prevent wrinkles?
The effectiveness of almonds in preventing wrinkles may vary from person to person, and results can be influenced by various factors such as genetics, overall diet, and skincare habits,” said Dr Gupta.

However, experts like Dr Gupta said it’s crucial to note that relying solely on almonds “may not be a comprehensive solution” for preventing wrinkles. “A holistic approach to skincare, including a well-balanced diet, proper hydration, sun protection, and a consistent skincare routine, is essential for maintaining healthy skin,” said Dr Gupta.
While almonds can be a nutritious addition to your diet, it’s important “not to expect miraculous results and to prioritise a well-rounded approach to skincare for the best outcomes”, Dr Gupta stressed. She added, “Consulting with a skin expert or dermatologist can provide personalised advice based on an individual’s specific skin type, concerns, and overall health is advised.”Advertisement

Malaika Arora impresses us with her cardio session,"Most of us are aware that when it comes to the world of fitness, nobody can quite beat Malaika Arora. Her stellar physique and workout snippets on Instagram are proof enough. In her latest fitness video, she can be seen practicing cardio exercises with her trainer Jahnavi Patwardhan. “Always killing it, this one. Starting the week off with some fun cardio and a dose of Casper’s energy,” said Patwardhan.
Here’s why cardio is important in your fitness routine.
The frequency of cardio workouts varies depending on individual goals, fitness levels, and overall health. “While there isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer, general guidelines can help determine how often one should engage in cardiovascular exercise,” said fitness expert Garima Goyal.
One factor to consider is the type of cardio activity. High-impact exercises like running or jumping may require more rest days than low-impact activities such as cycling or swimming. “Individuals with joint issues or those prone to overuse injuries might benefit from incorporating a mix of low- and high-impact exercises into their routine,” said Goyal.
How much cardio is too much?Advertisement
Another crucial aspect is one’s fitness level. Beginners may start with three to four cardio sessions per week, gradually increasing the frequency as their stamina improves. On the other hand, seasoned athletes or fitness enthusiasts may engage in cardio activities more frequently, balancing different intensities to prevent burnout and reduce the risk of overtraining.
Individual goals also play a role in determining cardio frequency. According to Goyal, someone focusing on weight loss might aim for more frequent sessions, while someone maintaining cardiovascular health might find the recommended guidelines sufficient. “It’s essential to align workout frequency with specific objectives to achieve optimal results.”
Listening to one’s body is paramount. Factors such as fatigue, soreness, and stress levels should be considered when planning cardio workouts. “Rest days are crucial for recovery, allowing the body to repair and adapt to the physical stress imposed during exercise. Ignoring signs of fatigue can lead to burnout, decreased performance, and an increased risk of injury,” said Goyal.

Variety is key in preventing monotony and overuse injuries. “Mixing different cardio activities not only helps target various muscle groups but also keeps workouts interesting. For example, incorporating days of running, cycling, swimming, and strength training can contribute to overall cardiovascular fitness while minimising the risk of repetitive strain injuries,” said Goyal.

Are smoothies recommended during pregnancy?,"A diverse, nutritious diet is recommended for pregnant women. As such, can smoothies be a wonderful option during pregnancy? According to Kristin Brown, a prenatal dietitian, smoothies can pack in a load of nutrients in one meal or a snack provided they have a balanced mix of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. “The issue I see with the smoothies that most people eat is that they are too heavy in carbohydrates and don’t have enough protein, fat, or fibre to keep blood sugar levels stable for long. This is a basic blueprint that I use with my clients to build various smoothie recipes that keep them satisfied for a long period (and help keep blood sugar levels stable, which helps fight pregnancy nausea),” said Kristin.
According to her, one can look to combine protein (collagen protein, protein powder, or Greek yogurt), fat (peanut butter, avocado, hemp hearts), fibre (chia seeds, ground flaxseed), antioxidants (berries, cherries, etc), vegetables (leafy greens or frozen cauliflower), liquid (unsweetened almond milk or the milk of your choice).

Dr Shobha Gupta, medical director, gyneacologist and IVF expert from Mother’s Lap IVF Centre New Delhi and Vrindavan affirmed that smoothies can be a nutritious option during pregnancy. “They allow you to incorporate a variety of fruits, vegetables, and dairy or plant-based milk, providing essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and fibre,” said Dr Gupta.
What kind of smoothies to have?Advertisement
Including a variety of fruits in smoothies adds essential vitamins such as vitamin C, potassium, and folate. “Berries, citrus fruits, and bananas are excellent choices, contributing to the overall health of both the mother and the baby, said Dt Arti Singh Consultant nutrition and dietitian, Motherhood Hospitals Kharghar Mumbai. “Additionally, adding leafy greens like spinach or kale boosts the smoothie’s folate content, crucial for fetal development,” said Singh.
To enhance protein intake, incorporating Greek yogurt, nut butter, or protein supplements recommended by clinical nutrition into smoothies is beneficial, mentioned Singh. “Protein is essential for the development of the baby’s organs, muscles, and tissues,” said Singh.
Including dairy or fortified plant-based milk in smoothies ensures an adequate calcium intake, vital for the baby’s bone development and the maintenance of the mother’s bone health.
However, ensure ingredients are safe for pregnancy and consult with your healthcare provider for personalised advice.Advertisement
Here is a nutritious pregnancy-friendly smoothie recipe, courtesy Dr Gupta
Ingredients

Why begin your mornings with a spoonful of ghee?,"A lot of celebrities have admitted to having ghee or clarified butter as the first thing in the morning. But have you ever wondered how this little dietary tweak aids your diet goals? We decided to ask experts what could be the benefit of such a change and whether it is good for the long term.
Payal Sharma, senior dietician, at Dharamshila Narayana Suprspeciality Hospital said starting your day with ghee can offer several health benefits. “Ghee or clarified butter with milk solids removed, is rich in saturated fats, which can provide a stable source of energy throughout the day. It contains medium-chain fatty acids that are easily digestible and quickly metabolised, promoting a sense of satiety,” said Sharma.
Ghee is a source of fat-soluble vitamins like A, E, and D, contributing to overall immune system support, skin health, and bone strength. It also contains antioxidants that may help combat oxidative stress and inflammation in the body, added Sharma.Advertisement
Ghee’s unique composition makes it an ideal choice for individuals managing diabetes, said Dr Archana Batra, a dietician and certified diabetes educator. “It has a low glycemic index, helping regulate blood sugar levels and providing a sustained release of energy throughout the day. Furthermore, ghee contains butyric acid, a short-chain fatty acid known for its anti-inflammatory properties, promoting gut health and overall well-being,” said Dr Batra. 
Consuming ghee in the morning can aid in the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients from other foods, enhancing their bioavailability. “Additionally, ghee is believed to have anti-inflammatory properties that may benefit joint health,” said Sharma.

Including ghee in your morning routine may also support digestive health by promoting a healthy balance of gut bacteria. “The butyric acid in ghee is thought to nourish the intestinal lining, potentially aiding in the prevention of digestive issues,” said Sharma.

How gut health affects fertility,"The gut microbiota, comprising trillions of microbes in the digestive tract, plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health. A balanced and diverse gut microbiome contributes to proper immune function, nutrient absorption, and hormonal regulation — all of which are essential factors for fertility. Yes, you read that right! Fertility and gut health are interconnected. “Research suggests that an imbalanced gut microbiota, known as dysbiosis, may negatively impact reproductive health. It can lead to inflammation and affect the production of hormones involved in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. Additionally, the gut microbiome influences the absorption of key nutrients, such as folate, which is crucial for fetal development,” said Dr Anusha Rao P, consultant obstetrics and gynaecology, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad.
Yoga coach Siddhanta Gogate took to Instagram to share a post. “Let’s explore how the microbiome, the community of microorganisms living in your gut, could be a key player in your fertility story,” said Gogate.
Inflammation
Inflammation, driven by an imbalance in gut bacteria, can impact fertility. “A compromised gut may lead to chronic inflammatory responses, affecting egg quality and embryo development,” said Gogate.
Vaginal healthAdvertisement
Your gut and reproductive tract are not isolated systems. “The same beneficial bacteria found in the gut, like lactobacillus species, also inhabit the vagina. A disturbed gut microbiome may alter the vaginal environment, potentially affecting fertility. Signs like frequent thrush or infections could be indicators that your gut needs attention,” said Gogate.

Oestrogen metabolism
Surprisingly, your gut health significantly influences oestrogen, a key reproductive hormone. An imbalanced gut microbiome may interfere with oestrogen metabolism, leading to conditions like ‘oestrogen dominance.’ This imbalance could contribute to reproductive health issues such as endometriosis or polycystic ovarian syndrome in women and impact sperm production in men.
As such, the gut plays a role in regulating inflammation and immune responses, both of which are implicated in fertility, added Dr Ritu Hinduja, fertility consultant, Nova IVF Fertility, Mumbai.Advertisement
Moreover, the gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication system between the gut and the brain, can influence stress levels and hormonal balance, both of which are essential for reproductive success.
Signs your gut needs some TLC (tender, loving care), according to Gogate
– Abdominal bloating or frequent gas
– Regular heartburn or belching
– Frequent diarrhea, constipation, or both
– Nausea or vomiting
– Messy or greasy stools
– (Un)known food sensitivities
– Frequent thrush or urinary tract infections
– PCOS or endometriosis
– Overweight or struggling to lose weight
What can help?
“Maintaining a healthy gut through a balanced diet, probiotics, and lifestyle choices may positively impact fertility by supporting a favourable environment for reproductive processes,” said Dr Rao.Advertisement

Probiotics and a diet rich in fibre, prebiotics, and fermented foods can promote a healthy gut microbiome, potentially positively impacting fertility. “While the field is still evolving, understanding and optimising gut health may offer novel approaches to support reproductive wellness,” said Dr Hinduja.

Experts on whether Sadhguru’s amla-honey-black pepper combination for boosting immunity works,"With the popularity of home remedies growing in the past few years, a vast majority of people are turning to these DIYs to cure ailments. As such, Sadhguru asserts that a combination of Indian gooseberry (amla), soaked overnight with honey and crushed green or black peppercorns, can help build immunity against seasonal illnesses.
In a video snippet, Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev shared its recipe.
Ingredients
Amla
Honey
Green pepper or black pepper
Method
*Soak pieces of cut amla in honey overnight along with green or black pepper pepper.
How to take it?
Take three spoons, three times a day every day.Advertisement
“It works best on an empty stomach. You can see an increase in your immune system. I would say in a matter of 4-8 weeks,” Sadhguru said.
Does this remedy work?
Simrat Bhui, dietitian explained the following benefits of each of the ingredients:
*Amla contains a high concentration of vitamin C, which helps the body recover from illness.
*Black pepper is rich in antioxidants, which help detox the body and prevent certain cancers, said Bhui. “Peppers have anti-inflammatory properties, which helps in wound healing and increasing metabolism.”Advertisement
*Honey has a therapeutic role in treating many respiratory diseases due to its anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and antioxidant properties, said Bhui.
Dietitian Sonia Narang mentioned that this combination is good for your skin, hair and increases your blood count. To reduce cholesterol levels and improve overall functioning of the heart, take it twice a day — once on an empty stomach in the morning, and the other at night, 30 minutes after dinner for best results,” said Narang.

According to nutritionist Apurva Agarwal, the benefits of amla, green pepper or black pepper, and honey, when combined, work to produce a powerful “immune-supporting elixir”. “Together with the bioavailability-enhancing piperine from black pepper and the vitamin C from amla and green pepper, this potent antioxidant trio strengthens the body’s defenses against oxidative stress and infections,” said Agarwal.

Experts note that the potent combination lowers the risk of immune-related illnesses by lowering chronic inflammation and strengthening the body’s defenses against infections. “The amla may be more easily absorbed by the body and have increased bioavailability after being soaked for the entire night. By strengthening the immune system and supporting the body’s natural defenses, taking this mixture regularly in the morning may improve general health,” said Agarwal.
Combination and consumption of all three can be used as immunity shots to prevent seasonal cough, COPD, and respiratory tract infections, Bhui added. “Regular use increases vitamin levels in the body, hence increasing immunity,” said Bhui.Advertisement

‘Indian men are facing a loneliness epidemic and we’re not talking about it enough’Premium Story,"Sex and the City. Veere Di Wedding. Golden Girls. Four More Shots Please! Mean Girls. Little Women. Myriad movies and shows are known and loved for their depiction of the female experience – the way women love, laugh, rage, live, cry, and exist in this world.
But somewhere between Amitabh Bachchan’s Angry Young Man and Rajesh Khanna’s “Pushpa, I hate tears”, a new Indian man was born whose emotional range began with anger and ended with hatred. At least that is what Sarthak Gupta, who is a counselling psychologist at Lissun, a mental health platform, believes. “It was like they were subtly letting us know that anger is the only acceptable emotion for a man,” he says.
According to psychologist Vishnupriya Bhagirath, “Indian men are facing a loneliness epidemic and we are not talking about it enough.”Advertisement
In its new GenZ Report, surveying over 900 youth across 20+ cities, youth impact organisation Yuvaa found that Gen Z men are twice as likely as women to feel lonely due to their gender; nearly half recognise needing safe spaces to discuss gender roles.
Nikhil Taneja, chief and co-founder of Yuvaa and famous for his Be A Man, Yaar! podcast, explained that this finding has been consistent with what they have heard at the Yuvaa roadshows where they travelled to 150+ campuses and engaged with over 15,000 students. “Young men would talk about the loneliness and lack of positive, nurturing communities they face as they get older,” he told indianexpress.com in an interaction.

For two 24-year-old journalists who have nothing in common except for their age and profession, this loneliness was exacerbated by the pandemic. “The feeling led to me crying and not being able to focus on anything,” said one. The other tried to cope by walking “almost 22 km a day with only music to keep me company”.
They are not alone considering the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a significant increase in loneliness around the world post-pandemic, even declaring it a global threat.Advertisement
How and why is loneliness in men becoming an issue?
Young men are particularly vulnerable. A 2023 State of American Men report by Equimundo, a non-profit organisation in the US, revealed that two-thirds of surveyed men between 18 and 23 feel as though “no one really knows them”. This loneliness is especially acute for unmarried men: one in five report no close friends, and a grimmer statistic, one in four under-30s say the same.
For 24-year-old Mouviz Khan, social media plays a role in worsening his loneliness. “Everyone seems to have a perfect life and as much as you tell yourself it is not entirely true, you do still end up feeling left out and lonely,” he says.
 A 2020 BBC loneliness experiment involving men aged 16-99 from 237 countries found that young men in individualistic cultures, where self-reliance reigns supreme and social bonds are looser, were the loneliest. (Source: Freepik)
A 2019 YouGov poll concluded that one in five men in the UK has no close friends, twice the rate of women. Across the pond, a 2021 Survey Center on American Life study found a more alarming trend: since 1995, the number of men reporting a lack of close friends has quintupled, rising from 3 per cent to 15 per cent. In the same research, the proportion of men claiming at least six close friends halved, from 55 per cent to a meagre 27 per cent.
Karan Cheema remembers feeling lonely as early as when he was in the first grade but he has not yet been able to open up to anyone. Cheema is 26 now. “I have friends but I am afraid to be vulnerable with them. I am surrounded by people, but I don’t feel as if I belong. The more frequently I meet people, the lonelier I feel,” he says.Advertisement
Sociology expert Pranay Aggarwal, who serves as India’s representative in UNESCO’s International Sociological Association, thinks it is ironic that the main reason why Indian men are reluctant to talk about loneliness is patriarchy, bearing in mind that they also benefit from it.
Traditional gender norms make it so that men fall under the pressure of projecting an image of themselves, which appears strong, macho, and independent. To the point of being unemotional, clinical even, says Aggarwal. “And there is a particular reluctance to seek support when it comes to this issue. It is seen as feminine to be expressing yourself, to be too creative, to be too emotional. Like that old cliched patriarchal adage – boys don’t cry. So there is a strong societal disapproval of any expression of emotion and any admission of vulnerability,” he says.
Nikhil Taneja agrees, saying that young men are as burdened by patriarchy as women since they are expected to take the role of the provider and work towards it from a young age, even in the modern world. “There are few safe spaces they find that allow them non-judgemental expression about what they are going through,” he says.
Aggarwal notes that if somebody does admit to feeling lonely or some sort of a vulnerability, it is seen as a sign of weakness. “If you risk talking about it to your friends, family, you may be mocked as a sissy or somewhat less of a man,” he adds.Advertisement

Cultural factors also seem to play a role. A 2020 BBC loneliness experiment involving men aged 16-99 from 237 countries found that young men in individualistic cultures, where self-reliance reigns supreme and social bonds are looser, were the loneliest.
Khan says he is extremely attached to his family and moving to a different city for work hit him in more ways than one, making him lonelier than ever.
With family structures changing, more and more nuclear families are mushrooming as people move to metros with greater geographical and social mobility and rising material aspirations. According to Aggarwal, who also mentors young men and women studying for the UPSC exam, this has created an erosion of a support system one could fall back on. The cocktail becomes particularly potent when you add the pressure to conform to rigid gender norms.
How can men and their loved ones help?
All the men who were contacted for this story confessed to needing help but not being able to ask for it.Advertisement
As per the 2022 statistics of the National Crimes Record Bureau, the number of men who died by suicide in India was more than double the number of women. This is a consistent trend.
The first rung of support must come from loved ones, says psychologist Bhagirath. This loved one could be a parent, a sibling or any other family member, or friends.  “Validate their feelings, encourage them to communicate openly, avoid dismissing their feelings, help them create social connections and engagements,” Bhagirath adds.
“I personally find it somewhat unfortunate that many students, especially young boys, though they share their feelings with me, are hesitant to share them even with their parents, particularly their fathers,” says Aggarwal, who is a mentor to students.

Of course, families and society must challenge the traditional stereotypes and rigid gender norms. But when it comes to providing care on an individual level, it might be a mistake, said counselling psychologist Gupta.
“Challenging belief systems is essential on a societal level, but on an individual level, it can push a man further into his shell. Instead, the best thing that we can do to help out men suffering from loneliness is to make sure to let them know that we are available to them. Reinforce this idea until they feel comfortable enough to approach you themselves and share their feelings of isolation. Any new ideas or thoughts should be introduced only after building this rapport,” he told indianexpress.com in an interaction.Advertisement
But, at some point, men also have to decide to do better. Acknowledge their emotions, at least, before anything else. “I have been working on myself, and my social skills, and it’s been going pretty well. There was a time I needed to seek external help which led me to joining group therapy. Group therapy sessions really helped me express during the lockdown. Very often people need external help and I’ve been one of them. At present, I try to go out of my way to socialise and the experience helps me cope with the feeling,” said 24-year-old Debesh Banerji.
The silence surrounding male loneliness in India is deafening, yet its consequences are profound. It ripples through lives, eroding mental well-being, straining relationships, and potentially leaving men more vulnerable to harmful coping mechanisms. But acknowledging this issue is not a sign of weakness; it’s a sign of strength, a recognition that men, too, need connection and support.

Dietary tweaks to prevent and manage period cramps,"Period cramps, also known as dysmenorrhea, are a common discomfort experienced by individuals with menstruating reproductive systems. They typically occur just before or during menstruation.
Caused by the uterine muscles contracting to facilitate the shedding of the uterine lining, the severity of period cramps varies among individuals, ranging from mild to intense pain. “Common symptoms include lower abdominal pain, backache, and sometimes radiating pain to the thighs,” said Dr Anusha Rao P, consultant obstetrics and gynaecology, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad.
According to licensed acupuncturist Dr. Khanita Suvarnasuddhi, to allow the blood to flow freely, one should have warm liquids like green tea, reduce the consumption of sugary foods, and cold beverages, and even salads. Instead, eat more roasted vegetables. She also mentioned that one should aim to decrease dairy intake to prevent cramping.Advertisement
While individual responses to remedies can vary, some people find relief from period cramps by incorporating some of these practices, said Dr Rao.
Green tea and hot water are known to have soothing effects and may help alleviate discomfort. “Green tea contains antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties that could potentially provide relief,” said Dr Rao.
Avoiding cold drinks and ice creams may be beneficial, as cold temperatures can “constrict blood vessels and potentially exacerbate cramps”, said Dr Rao.
Decreasing dairy intake might be helpful for some individuals, as dairy products can contribute to inflammation, mentioned Dr Rao. Additionally, limiting caffeine intake may help reduce tension and anxiety associated with menstrual cramps, said Dr Sarada M, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad. Advertisement

What else can help?
According to Dr Rao, it’s essential to stay hydrated, maintain a balanced diet, and consider incorporating other lifestyle changes like regular exercise and stress management for overall well-being.
Dr Sarada listed out a few dietary tweaks that can help 
Fruits and vegetables: Incorporate a variety of fruits and vegetables into your diet. They are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, which can help reduce inflammation and alleviate cramps. Bananas, in particular, contain potassium that may help reduce water retention and bloating, said Dr Sarada. 
Whole grains: Opt for whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, and oats. “These grains are high in fibre, which can aid in digestion and help regulate hormones that influence menstrual cramps,” said Dr Sarada. Advertisement
Lean proteins: Include lean protein sources such as poultry, fish, tofu, and legumes in your diet. Protein helps stabilise blood sugar levels, potentially reducing mood swings and cravings associated with the menstrual cycle.
Healthy fats: Incorporate sources of healthy fats like avocados, nuts, and seeds. “Omega-3 fatty acids found in fatty fish (salmon, mackerel) and flaxseeds have anti-inflammatory properties that may help alleviate cramps,” said Dr Sarada
Herbs and spices: Ginger and turmeric are known for their anti-inflammatory properties. Adding them to your meals or enjoying them in teas may provide relief from menstrual discomfort, said Dr Sarada. 
Calcium-rich foods: Foods rich in calcium, such as dairy products, fortified plant-based milk, and leafy green vegetables, may help reduce muscle cramping.Advertisement
Magnesium: Magnesium-rich foods like almonds, spinach, and dark chocolate may help relax muscles and alleviate cramps. Consider incorporating these into your diet.
Hydration: Staying well-hydrated is essential. Dr Sarada added that water helps with overall bodily functions and can reduce bloating associated with menstruation.
Herbal teas: Peppermint or chamomile tea may have soothing effects and help relax the muscles, providing relief from cramps.

Find Your Way: The India Art Fair Guide,"For international art
Given that works of international artists are not regularly exhibited in galleries and museums in India, the IAF offers that occasional opportunity. On view, this year, is the monumental 320 x 1320 cm woma block work titled Water Lilies by Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei. At the neugerriemschneider booth, it draws from French painter Edouard Manet’s meticulously crafted gardens, and is the first viewing of this version by Ai Weiwei, rendered in vibrant colours for India. The Berlin-based gallery has juxtaposed it with Israeli artist, dance composer and notation specialist Noa Eshkol’s textile work Folk Dance with overlapping circular and semi-circular arcs, and Icelandic-Danish artist Olafur Eliasson’s Unseeing the Blind Spot in stainless steel. While Galleria Continua also has the Chinese artist’s works, the central wall at the booth has a stainless steel Anish Kapoor Magenta Pink and Red Wine satin that represents his engagement with colour. Also at the booth are Paris-based Eva Jospin’s silk thread embroidered intricate forests.

Making its debut at IAF, Galerie Geek Art from Japan has, among others, artist Kaneko Tomiyuki’s Great Tiger: Pacifier of Fire and Wind in mineral pigments, Japanese ink, transparent watercolour. As part of the launch of its Villa Swagatam residency programme, the French Institute in India, meanwhile, is presenting Franco-Cameroonian artist Barthélémy Toguo’s installation titled Water Matters, made in collaboration with artisans of the embroidery school Chanakya School of Craft and its creative director Karishma Swali. Contemporary Australian indigenous artist Sarrita King has a solo at the fair, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) is presenting Irish artist John Gerrard’s digital work Western Flag (NFT) to reflect on the history of oil consumption in the US.

While Bruno Art Group has returned to the IAF with American artist Andy Warhol’s silkprints of Chinese leader Mao Zedong and American actress Marilyn Monroe, for its debut at the fair, Akara Contemporary from Akara has brought, among others, sculptures by Keita Miyazaki, who works between London and Tokyo, and brings together thought-provoking combinations of materials such as metal, fragile paper and felt.Advertisement
If looking for modernists
Much like the art market in India, the modernists masters also dominate the art fair. The IAF has some of their more distinctive works. At Vadehra Art Gallery the 1999 Tyeb Mehta canvas titled Falling Bird recalls the associations the veteran artist’s falling figures and motifs had with his childhood recollections of violence that followed the Partition of the Indian subcontinent. If Grosvenor Gallery has, among others, FN Souza’s Ask Me Why?, a striking rendering of a male subject, at Art Heritage are works from Somnath Hore’s famed Wounds series. Gallerie Nvya has smaller pen and ink Jamini Roy works juxtaposed with a tempera of the Bengal artist depicting The Last Supper. Chawla Art Gallery is presenting as part of its booth paper works by MV Dhurandhar, KK Hebbar’s untitled portrait alongside Bhupen Khakar’s Kiss, and, also, works by Jamini Roy and Anjoli Ela Menon that can be read in braille.

At DAG, the curated showcase, “India Past and Present” explores the evolution of Indian art through the 18th to 21st centuries with works of modernists such as MF Husain, FN Souza and Krishen Khanna alongside Western artists who travelled to India, such as Thomas Daniell and Marius Bauer, and pre-modern artists. The highlights include Sewak Ram’s Muharram, R Regunatha Naidu’s Kaliya Daman and an MF Husian self-portrait.Advertisement
Talking Points
With blurred letters on the fog-screen symbolic of forgotten histories, Jitish Kallat’s immersive installation titled Antumbra is a reflection on the passage of time and confinement. Premiering at IAF, the work gives a glimpse into desk calendars of South Africa’s first black president Nelson Mandela from his time in prison. Spanning 1976 to 1989, at several places, the pages remain blank, but in others there are notations of his blood pressure, records of recent dreams and prison visits. “There are some historical events that find mention, including Indian election results in 1980, but at the same time we find that some other historical events remain unmentioned, possibly because the news did not reach him or there could be deliberate omissions due to scrutiny,” says Kallat.

At Experimenter — that is presenting a group exhibition featuring 15 new commissions by 15 artists marking 15 years of the art fair and the gallery — are Sahil Naik’s ceramic tile works from the series “Migrant flowers for postcolonial desires”, that continues his interest “in extracting patterns between the histories of colonisation, non-alignment and structures of Modern nation-building”. It delves into the history of flowering trees brought to India by the colonisers and the new architectural lexicon post-Independence.
If the Anant Art booth has a set of works by Gulammohammed Sheikh that engage with the politics of language by creating complex three-dimensional forms out of Urdu and Persian letters carved out of books and pasted on wasli paper, at Vadehra Art Gallery are Atul Dodiya cabinets that occupy different elements and objects to tell a story.
In the Studio section, interdisciplinary hearing-impaired artist Janhavi Khemka is sharing her experiences and observations through stop-motion animations developed from woodcut prints that come together under the title “Waiting for Dawn”. If A Letter to My Mother has animated patterns of lips in woodcut, reminiscent of the mat on which her mother first taught her to lip read, Siri’s Here to Help brings forth the absurdities of miscommunication. At the booth, she was discussing her life and art with the viewers.Advertisement
Woven narratives
Several works in textile are making an impression at the fair — some for their handwork, others for the subjects they depict. At Shrine Empire, Bengaluru-based artist Renuka Rajiv’s Cushion Cover Myopia/ Armchair Inaction has interwoven squares in fabric and thread, with statements as lead-ins for the viewers. Shivani Aggarwal’s set of 10 works, Holding Nothingness, at Studio Art reflects on what is known and what is not, and T Venkanna’s Strong Desire at Gallery Maskara has a man dying “while his living partner struggles on for connection”. Anup Mehta Contemporary has Sarika Bajaj’s meticulously woven feathers and threads on jute works, and at Gallerie Splash there is Akshata Mokashi’s tapestry where weaving is influenced by the medieval tapestries of Europe and Indian rugs. Known to respond to his socio-political surroundings, Bangladeshi artist Mahbubur Rahman’s silk embroidery artwork from the series “The Heroes”, including a portrait of Princess Sophia Duleep Singh, are showing at Blueprint 12.

Some artworks intend for the viewers to be creators and decision-makers. The designers of the tent facade at IAF this year, artists Jiten Thukral and Sumir Tagra are also inviting audiences to create their own stories in the digital world by allowing them to choose from a selection of over 70,000 words that relate to ‘Forces of Nature’. The algorithm subsequently generates a custom digital artwork with the artist duo’s motifs transforming the words into a digital tapestry in varied colours and patterns — the final creations are being digitally shared with the creators. At another booth, also being shared are portraits drawn by participants in the Procreate app on iPad during a 60-minute session.

At the Experimenter booth, Afrah Shafiq is inviting audiences to play a game in The Bride Who Could Not Stop Crying, warning early-on that the choices they make will determine how much she cries. Dhruv Jain, on the other hand, is asking them to navigate narrow paths in a game where they confront buried histories and lost landscapes. If Sadhna Prasad’s digital work allows viewers to explore nature’s hierarchies using an iPad, at Method they can experience an immersive installation that incorporates principles of colour psychology and emotional mapping to respond to the participants’ rhythms of heart and breath to reflect the colours around them.
In “Orinthoscope”, digital artists in residence, Myles and Ameya, are presenting an immersive audiovisual piece that maps two decades of birdsong across the Indian subcontinent — choose your state and year. The learnings might disappoint though — as both the perching sounds and sightings of birds have dwindled over the years.
Being led at the fair
Navigating so much art can be daunting. For those who prefer for someone to escort them around the fair and help them read art are several curated tours being conducted through the day. While independent researcher, educator and curator Shaleen Wadhwana is taking visitors through select highlights at IAF, the tour “Green Conscious” highlights key works that respond to our ecological and climate crises.Advertisement
“Art History 101” discusses the living artistic traditions of South Asia, and “Art of the Possible” engages “with artworks that showcase the everyday reality of social difference through lenses ranging from queerness to caste”.
In a first, the fair also has art tours designed for children — from teaching them empathy through an art walk or, in another walk, teaching them to be conscious of ecological concerns. For more details on art tours and timings, log on: https://indiaartfair.in.

"Deepika Padukone, Gigi Hadid can’t get enough of the eclectic Grandpa fashion trend but what is it?","Who doesn’t love their grandpas? Chill and filled with love to the brim — these two things define our nanajis and dadajis. And that is exactly what eclectic Grandpa fashion is about too.
This fashion movement pays homage to the timeless and classic style of grandfathers, offering a unique blend of comfort, elegance, and a touch of retro charm.
Grandpacore or the eclectic Grandpa trend, at its core, is an embrace of the sartorial choices associated with grandfathers. It’s a celebration of the effortlessly dapper, comfortable, and often quirky fashion that defined the wardrobes of the older generation.Advertisement
This trend is characterised by a mix of vintage-inspired pieces, classic accessories, and an overall sense of nostalgia.

Key elements of Grandpacore Fashion to ace the trend

Comfortable Classics: Grandpacore is all about comfort without compromising style. Embrace classic pieces such as cardigans, cable-knit sweaters, and relaxed-fit trousers. Look for timeless patterns like houndstooth, plaid, or argyle to add a vintage touch to your wardrobe.
Timeless Tailoring: Invest in well-tailored pieces that exude sophistication. Classic blazers, waistcoats, and well-fitted trousers are key elements of Grandpacore fashion. Opt for earthy tones or muted colours to maintain a refined and elegant look.
Vintage Accessories: Elevate your eclectic Grandpa ensemble with carefully chosen accessories. Consider donning a pocket watch, a stylish hat, or a pair of suspenders to add a touch of old-world charm. Vintage-inspired eyeglasses can also be a subtle yet impactful accessory.
Quality Footwear: Grandpacore places emphasis on quality footwear because comfort is key. Opt for classic loafers, brogues, or well-crafted leather shoes. These timeless choices not only complement the overall aesthetic but also ensure comfort and durability.
Mixing Textures: Experiment with different textures to add depth and character to your outfits. Corduroy, tweed, and wool are textures that resonate well with the eclectic Grandpa style. Mixing and matching these materials can create a sophisticated and visually appealing look.

Have your ears been hurting in winter? Here are 8 ways to stay protected,"As winter throws its chilly cloak over the world, we snuggle deeper into scarves and mittens, seeking warmth wherever we can. But amidst the cosy nights and frosty mornings, there’s another part of us that often feels the sting of the season: our ears.
That persistent ache, the sharp twinge, or the annoying muffled feeling—ear pain in winter is a common reality for many. But why do our ears, these seemingly small and protected appendages, become so vulnerable when the mercury dips? The answer lies in a fascinating interplay of anatomy, weather, and even our everyday habits.
Dr Deepti Sinha, lead consultant, Dept of ENT at the CK Birla Hospital (R), Delhi, explained that this pain can be caused by several factors, including exposure to cold, dry air, changes in moisture content, sinus infections, and a higher risk of respiratory infections.Advertisement
“Discomfort may be exacerbated by ear canal inflammation and dryness brought on by cold weather and atmospheric disturbances. Additionally, sinusitis and respiratory infections may cause congestion and inflammation, impacting the Eustachian tube and resulting in ear pain,” she explained in an interaction with indianexpress.com. 
Even though some ear pain is normal and frequently goes away on its own, persistent, or severe ear pain should not be disregarded as it may be a sign of a more serious problem, such as an ear infection, Dr Sinha warned, adding that excessive cleaning should be avoided.
“If symptoms persist or worsen, seeking medical attention is important for proper diagnosis and treatment,” said Dr Sinha.
Here are 8 ways to stay protected from ear pain in winter
Wear Earmuffs: To protect and warm your ears, get a decent pair of earmuffs. Verify that they are adequately insulated and fit comfortably.Advertisement
Use a Hat or Headband: You may keep your ears warm and shield them from chilly breezes by wearing a cap or headband that covers them.
Choose Warm Fabrics: Opt for hats and earmuffs made from warm and insulating materials like wool or fleece.
Keep Ears Dry: Wet Ears may be more vulnerable to cold weather. To keep your ears dry in rainy or snowy weather, use a hood or umbrella.
Stay Hydrated: Drinking enough water is essential for overall health, including skin health.Advertisement

Moisturise Your Ears: Apply a gentle moisturiser to your ears to prevent dryness and irritation caused by cold and windy weather.
Avoid Excessive Ear Cleaning: Ears that are too clean can lose their natural oils and become more prone to dryness. Refrain from using cotton swabs to clean your ears too deeply.
Consult a Professional: You must see a doctor if you have ongoing pain or discomfort in your ears during the winter. They can evaluate your circumstances and offer specific solutions.
Neglected ear pain during the winter season can become troublesome, potentially leading to temporary hearing loss. For a prompt resolution, early treatment is recommended.",lifestyle
"You need less than 4,000 steps a day for better brain health, says study","New research suggests that a bit of exercise could plump up your brain. Published last month in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease, the study examined brain scans of over 10,000 individuals and found that even a sprinkle of exercise, as little as a few thousand steps a day, might be associated with a larger brain volume.
Brain volume is linked to our brain’s health, with less mass indicating a decline in cognition and potentially setting the stage for dementia. So, researchers suggest that maintaining or even increasing brain mass could have “potential neuroprotective effects.”
“We discovered that even moderate levels of physical activity, like clocking up fewer than 4,000 steps a day, can have a positive impact on brain health,” said Dr David Merrill, study co-author and director of the Pacific Neuroscience Institute’s Brain Health Centre, in a statement. “That’s considerably less than the often-touted 10,000 steps, making it a more achievable goal for many.”Advertisement
The 10,125 participants, with an average age of 52, underwent whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to measure their brain volume relative to their exercise levels.
Whether they were walking, running, or playing sports, folks who engaged in moderate to vigorous activity – exercise that gets your heart and lungs pumping for at least 10 minutes – had more grey matter in key regions like the hippocampus (memory HQ), grey matter (information processing central), and the occipital, frontal, and parietal lobes.
Dr Sri Karan Uddesh Tanugula, consultant general physician, Yashoda Hospitals Hyderabad, explained that physical activity increases blood flow to the brain, delivering more oxygen and nutrients, which supports cognitive function.
“It also stimulates the release of chemicals like neurotransmitters and growth factors, promoting the growth of new neurons and enhancing overall brain connectivity. Exercise is also associated with reduced inflammation and improved mood, contributing to a healthier brain,” he tells indianexpresss.com in an interaction.Advertisement
Moderate exercise, for 45 minutes daily, is known to improve problem-solving skills, judgment, cognition, and memory, according to Dr Dilip Gude, senior consultant physician, Yashoda Hospitals Hyderabad. Emotional balance is also known to improve from exercise mitigating depression, anxiety, etc, he added.
However, Dr Gude warned that intense exercise is known to negatively affect brain health, predominantly memory.
To ensure the right amount of exercise without overdoing it, it’s important to follow general guidelines. Dr Tanugula suggested these:

Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days.
Listen to your body, gradually increase intensity, and incorporate variety into your routine.
After exercising, prioritise proper cool-down techniques, such as stretching, to prevent injury.
Adequate hydration, balanced nutrition, and sufficient rest are crucial for recovery and overall well-being.

Consult with a healthcare professional or fitness expert to tailor a regimen based on your individual needs and health status.",lifestyle
Where every home is an art boutique: Meet the rural entrepreneurs of Odisha’s Raghurajpur Heritage Crafts Village,"Roads dotted with banana, coconut, jackfruit, and palm trees. Betel and paddy fields on either side. The air full of aromas of Odia khaja – the famous deep-fried sweet from Odisha- and occasional shops selling samosa with gughni, rasgullas, and chenna poda. For all art lovers, lovers of history mythology, and enthusiastic travelers in general, a trip to Lord Jagannath
temple, recommended early morning, must be followed by this beautiful drive to the village of Raghurajpur, famous for its heritage crafts-village status popular for its Pattachitra crafts.
Artisans as storytellers
Around 10 km from Puri, with around 180 households, every family continues the legacy of the vintage pattachitra paintings. There are about nine forms of crafts practiced by artisans here, from pattachitra paintings, palm leaf engraving, wood carving, tussar silk paintings, papier-mâché crafts, stone carving and handicrafts, coconut crafts, cow dung paintings to aluminum crafts.Advertisement

Beautiful wall paintings and murals adorn every house with paintings of Lord Jagannath, scenes from the Ramayana, Mahabharata, Dashavatara, Krishna Leela, traditional marriage ceremonies, etc. The storytelling through images is magnificent, and purely as a painting, the finishing of the ‘Chitrakaars’ of Raghurajpur is of high quality.
Green Entrepreneurship
Entrepreneurship is also at the polite display- every artisan is interested in taking the visitors/tourists to their homes, greeting them, and showcasing their art, thus engaging in the age-old traditional form of direct marketing to ensure sales. There is a generational and occupational legacy associated with the crafts. All the members of the families are associated with painting, and the younger ones usually undergo training.
Symmetric rangolis, locally called ‘chittas,’ made of ‘chuna,’ ‘geru,’ and other organic colours greet the tourists, and the craftsmen and women begin displaying their work –paintings, big and small, their prices running into lakhs starting from a modest INR 1000. Art connoisseurs from all corners of the world visit this quaint village, thriving and bustling with art activity.
The canvas of a typical painting is made of layered cotton cloths, which are pasted one after the other after treating the cloths with tamarind gum obtained by boiling tamarind seeds. This cotton canvas is treated with chalk and stone powder, giving it a unique texture that makes pattachitra sustainable and durable.Advertisement

Beautifully painted reused bottles, papier mache utensils, handicrafts inspired by nature, and usage of organic colors make these artists green entrepreneurs promoting sustainable entrepreneurship.
The ‘tala patrachitra’ palm leaf paintings are also eco-friendly. These are made from palm leaves, drying and stitching leaves together. Engravings are then done using ink and colour. Detailed scenes from the Mahabharata are commonly engraved. A popular palm leaf painting is ‘The Tree of Life.’
Lessons in Marketing from ‘Chitrakaars’ of Raghurajpur
Many artisans are active on Instagram, realising the importance of reaching urban consumers in far-flung cities.
Alok Ranjan Sahoo, 28, calls their ‘modest’ home ‘Sudarshan Art and Craft,’ which also has an Instagram page. “We supplied unique three-in-one lord Jagannath’s idols to the G-20 presidency meet at the Bharat Mandapam last year,” he says.Advertisement
Taking online classes for students as a master trainer, the young entrepreneur is convinced about the sustainability of the art, which is beautifully carved on aluminum utensils, especially kettles and bottles, wall hangings, and idols. “I don’t want to work in the city. As an artist, this vocation allows me to ‘work from home’ and stay connected to my roots and culture,” he adds.
Digital marketing has immensely changed the way access and visibility are perceived. Still, many don’t use Instagram as young artisans like Sahoo do. Traditional artisans rely more on their skills, word of mouth, and innate talent, which naturally bring enthusiasts willing to purchase authentic art at any price.

Kirtan Das (45) has been making stone crafts for twenty years using the Kendumundi stones and has been engaged in sculpture works, mainly in addition to being a seasoned painter. He supplies paintings to interior designers and refrains from using online platforms, saying “copying and imitation” and plagiarising art are primary concerns and threats of using digital marketing as a means. He does not let us click any photographs of some of his unique artworks.
Artists like Das are confident of their skill and relentlessly paint with or without pre-orders or online marketing.Advertisement
The heritage village status helps them acquire the necessary exposure, with tourists willing to purchase artworks in bulk. Speaking on some of the challenges, he says, “Big artworks, paintings, and heavy stone art are difficult to carry. Tourists and visitors generally prefer small souvenirs and handicrafts, giving them more choices and making them convenient to carry as gifts.”
Depending on their size, scale, and detailing, the paintings take between two weeks to six months to finish, requiring immense patience and dedication even in the wake of adversity.
According to the locals, the intense cyclone in 1999 and Cyclone Fani in 2019 damaged some houses, affecting livelihoods. Some houses were then reconstructed during the repair, rehabilitation, and reconstruction work. In 2000, the village became a heritage crafts village recognised by INTACH (Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage.

The way forward
Modern-day facilities are unavailable to artisans as most work is done in groups sitting on the floor, which can present challenges, especially to older artisans. And this is where the artisans need state intervention.Advertisement
The fact that Raghurajpur has the status of a heritage crafts village merits investments in approach roads, modern facilities for artists, training in digital infrastructure, marketing, and modern entrepreneurship. “Many artisans from the village have won awards. The government should invest more in village infrastructure like roads, shops, pavements, water facilities, and electricity for our development,” says Das.
The government, however, helped the village and artisans during COVID-19 when the lockdowns impacted tourism in the village.

“Every family received INR 10,000 during COVID-19 from the government, encouraging us to sustain and promote this art form through a mural art workshop that gave us more recognition,” says Sona Prabha Das (35). Schemes such as ORMAS (Odisha Rural Development and Marketing Society) also help SHGs and artisans. In 2023, the village was recognized as the “best tourism village” under the silver category.
Raghurajpur is a testament to how living art and craft traditions can be preserved with sustained efforts by the government in close community partnerships. Every household here offers an immersive grassroots experience – a living art exhibition -showcasing the unique talents of rural communities, preserving culture, and contributing to the state’s cultural capital. Similar initiatives can be undertaken to promote diminishing art forms like Rogan (cloth art printing) in Gujarat and other forms of intangible heritage.",lifestyle
Poonam Pandey stages death to spread awareness on cervical cancer: What causes it and how to prevent,"A day after her team announced her “death” from cervical cancer, actor and reality TV personality Poonam Pandey on Saturday posted on her Instagram handle that she is alive and that her intention was to shock everyone into a conversation on the malady.
“I am alive. I didn’t die of cervical cancer. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about the hundreds and thousands of women who have lost their lives due to cervical cancer, ” Pandey posted.
Cervical cancer, according to figures from the World Health Organisation (WHO), is the fourth most common cancer in women globally, responsible for an estimated 264,000 deaths each year. More than 85 per cent of these deaths are in low and middle-income countries.

Cervical cancer occurs when cells in the cervix – the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina – grow out of control, Dr Manish Machave, consulting obstetrician, gynaecologist & gynaecological endoscopic surgeon, Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune, explained.Advertisement
Despite being preventable through vaccination, and treatable if detected early, cervical cancer continues to pose challenges, especially in developing countries. According to Dr Machave, those aged 30 and above are highly susceptible.
The central government recently announced it’s including the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in its national immunisation program. The inclusion of the HPV vaccine in the national immunisation program promises significant strides in protecting young women from cervical cancer.
“The primary driver of cervical cancer is persistent infection with specific strains of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV, a prevalent virus transmitted through sexual activity, is encountered by at least half of sexually active individuals at some point in their lives. However, only a small percentage will develop cervical cancer as a result,” Dr Machave explained to indianexpress.com in an interaction.
Other factors contributing to cervical cancer risk include early marriage, multiple pregnancies, and lack of preventive measures such as vaccination and screening, said Dr Machave.Advertisement
Dr Thejaswini J, consultant – obstetrician and gynaecologist, Motherhood Hospitals, E-city, Bengaluru, added that early age sexual activity, unprotected sex, and tobacco/alcohol consumption can further increase the risk of developing cervical cancer.
“One of the key challenges we face is the lack of awareness among women. Many women do not come for Pap smear testing, which is an essential part of the overall health checkup for women of reproductive age, recommended every 1 to 3 years. However, as a gynecologist, whenever a sexually active patient visits us, we strongly advise them to undergo opportunistic screening, including Pap smear testing. Increasing awareness is crucial in addressing this issue,” she added.
What are the symptoms of cervical cancer?
Cervical cancer may manifest through various symptoms noted Dr Machave,  including:

Constant bleeding, spotting between periods, or after menopause.
Heavier and longer menstrual bleeding than usual.
Watery, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, particularly in advanced stages.
Pelvic pain or pain during intercourse, as the cancer progresses and affects nearby tissues.
Pain during urination or blood in urine.
Weight loss without apparent reason.
Fatigue.
Swelling in legs.
Back pain or leg pain.
Difficulty in controlling urine or bowel movements in advanced stages.

How can cervical cancer be prevented?
Cervical cancer is preventable through various measures, according to Dr Machave.Advertisement
HPV Vaccination: Starting between ages 9 and 12, with catch-up vaccinations available until age 26, significantly reduces the risk of cervical cancer. Vaccination schedules involve multiple doses administered at specific intervals, offering protection against HPV strains associated with cervical cancer.
Regular Screening: Pap tests and HPV tests are crucial for early detection. Routine screenings starting at age 21, repeated every few years, help detect precancerous conditions early, allowing for monitoring or treatment to prevent cervical cancer development.
Awareness and Education: Increasing awareness, especially in underserved communities, about cervical cancer, its symptoms, and the importance of vaccination and screening is essential for prevention efforts.
Access to Affordable Treatment: Ensuring access to affordable and quality treatment for diagnosed cases is vital, addressing financial barriers and disparities in healthcare services distribution.Advertisement

What does the treatment of cervical cancer include?
Treatment options for cervical cancer vary depending on the stage and severity but may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemo, targeted and immunotherapy at early levels.
Focusing on relieving symptoms and improving quality of life is of paramount need, especially in advanced stages where curing the cancer may not be possible.
The suggested age to start the vaccination is between 9 and 12 years, and individuals can receive catch-up vaccinations until the age of 26.
How often should a woman screen herself for cervical cancer and other forms?
Routine Pap tests are recommended, starting at age 21, and repeating every few years, said Dr Machave.Advertisement
Dr Uma Dangi, consultant-medical oncology, Fortis Hospital Mulund & Hiranandani Hospital, Vashi, said that cervical cancer screening should begin at the age of 30 years, or 3 years after the onset of sexual activity. Pap smear is the commonly used test for this purpose.
“It should be performed once every 3 years until the age of 65-70 years. Screening can be discontinued if the last three results have been negative. If an HPV test is included, the frequency can be reduced to every 5 years,” said Dr Dangi.
Other cancers that can be screened in women include breast cancer and colon cancer. For breast cancer, mammography is recommended once a year after the age of 45, with self-breast examination every month starting at the age of 20-25 years. For colon cancer, a stool test for occult blood after the age of 50 years, along with sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, can be considered. For individuals at higher risk, screening should commence at a much earlier age.",lifestyle
Do you feel like a ‘failure’ despite all your achievements? You might be dealing with your ‘inner critic’,"Does the voice in your head sometimes go: “You suck….”? “What the hell have you done?” “Ugh, not again!” This is exactly what your inner critic sounds like. Dr Rohan Kumar, a consultant psychiatrist at Regency Hospital, defines it as the “internalised voice or thought process that individuals develop, often unconsciously, which tends to be harsh, judgmental, and critical of oneself.”
You might be thinking, “How can this inner critic really affect us, after all, it’s just ‘a voice in our head’?” Well, this ‘inner critic’ can have a profound impact on an individual’s emotional well-being and self-esteem. “This inner voice can be a relentless adversary, casting judgments upon one’s actions and achievements,” Neha Cadabam, a psychologist and executive director at Cadabams Hospital, explained.
So, what is the solution? Can we really silence this inner critic?
To put it softly — no, but we can manage it.Advertisement
Picture the inner critic as the driver of our body. Like any driver, it can be experienced or inexperienced —prone to making mistakes. Rather than attempting to change the driver (which we can’t psychologically), the focus should be on training it to avoid future accidents. “Since this phenomenon is rooted in negative self-talk— a concept within cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) — individuals can seek therapy to help identify and challenge these thoughts to promote healthier thinking patterns,” noted Dr Kumar.
What are the steps to manage this inner critic?
First, said Cadabam, is to recognise the signs. “Acknowledging that you are grappling with an inner critic is the foundational step. This unveils the battleground where self-doubt clashes with self-acceptance.”
Some common indicators include:
Negative self-talk: Constantly berating oneself with harsh words and self-criticism.
Perfectionism: Setting unrealistically high standards for oneself and feeling inadequate when these standards are not met.
Overgeneralisation: Drawing sweeping conclusions about personal abilities or worth based on specific instances of perceived failure.
Catastrophising: Magnifying the importance of mistakes or setbacks, viewing them as disastrous.
Low self-esteem: Feeling consistently unworthy or lacking in self-confidence.
Now that you know the indicators, it is important to subject this inner critic to rational scrutiny.Advertisement
“Imagine: you just received accolades for a significant project at work. Despite external validation, the inner critic might surface, whispering, “You got lucky this time?” In such a scenario, distinguish between its realistic and unrealistic claims. Evaluate whether the criticisms align with objective reality or if they are born from irrational self-perception,” said Cadabam.
What are the other strategies?
Journaling for insight: The act of journaling can be a powerful tool for unraveling the inner critic’s patterns. Documenting these self-critical thoughts provides a tangible record, revealing recurrent themes and triggers.
Cultivating self-compassion: Enhancing self-compassion is a pivotal strategy in addressing the inner critic. This involves treating oneself with the same kindness, understanding, and support that one would offer to a dear friend facing similar challenges.
Positive affirmations: Encouraging the use of positive affirmations helps counteract negative self-talk. Creating and repeating affirmations that emphasise one’s strengths and abilities. Consistent practice can gradually shift the inner narrative towards a more positive outlook.Advertisement
Setting realistic standards: Set achievable and realistic goals. Perfectionism often fuels the inner critic, so learning to embrace the idea that nobody is perfect and that mistakes are a natural part of growth is crucial for silencing self-critical thoughts.

Non-reactive response: It is paramount not to act impulsively based on the inner critic’s judgment. Self-compassion, as practiced, allows you to refrain from self-criticism and instead respond with kindness and patience.

Dr Kumar highlights that in some cases, the guidance of a mental health professional is essential. “Therapists, counselors, or psychologists can provide tailored strategies and support to address specific challenges related to the inner critic. These professionals employ evidence-based approaches to help individuals navigate and overcome self-critical tendencies.”
In conclusion, the journey to manage your inner critic is daunting, but worth it. “It requires introspection and challenging irrational beliefs, leading to the growth of a kinder, more understanding relationship with oneself. Remember, you have the capacity to tame this inner critic, and in doing so, unlock the door to a more emotionally resilient and self-affirming existence,” Cadabam asserted.",lifestyle

Giving the body a cooling effect and hydration, the combination increases the fibre content just with a drink and helps in acidity, Bhui added. According to nutritionist Kiran Kukreja, coconut water with soaked sabja seeds helps to relieve acidity as it can neutralise the acidic effect of HCL in the body.
“Both being high in antioxidants provides good detoxification and promote weight loss,” Bhui said.
Nutritionist Aarti Babhoota, founder, Yukah, community director, Vaatalya shared that it is not a mandate that it works only with coconut water. “It can work with simple water or lemon water. It should be taken in moderation,” said Babhoota.
How to prepare this remedy, according to Kukreja

Many people mistakenly believe that using them alone will lead to weight loss. “While they are a healthy addition, overall lifestyle choices, including a well-rounded diet and regular exercise, play a crucial role in achieving and maintaining a healthy weight,” said Jain.

"Masaba Gupta joins the 5 am club; know more about the practice of self-love, growth","Masaba Gupta has been on a fitness journey for the past few years. After making innumerable changes and trying out various dietary and fitness changes, the fashion designer admitted to joining the 5 am club. “5.41 am = Water + Read + Workout,” shared Gupta.
For the unversed, the 5 am club means waking up at 5 am and starting the day with purposeful activities. But if you ask Saurabh Bothra, CEO, Habuild, he redefined the ‘5 am club’ as the most important habit for self-care and the first step towards self-love, which everyone should take.
“In the times that we live in, the minute we open our eyes, the world starts bombarding our brain with all kinds of information. We let other situations, information, and people set the tone of our day. But isn’t this supposed to be our right? Absolutely! And waking up at 5 am gives us that freedom. Early mornings offer a quiet and focused time to contribute towards our physical, emotional, and mental well-being,” Bothra said.
How does it help with fitness habits?Advertisement
If you wake up early and exercise, you’re starting your day with a win! It will create a positive ripple effect throughout your day, making you more likely to stick to your fitness goals. According to Bothra, when it comes to building and maintaining habits, consistency is the key. “When you start early in the day and go for a run or do yoga regularly, you are making a routine that will help your mind and body to adapt and stay consistent,” said Bothra.
The quiet, distraction-free time in the early morning allows you to focus and reflect on your other habits.
What are the benefits?
It can give you the stamina and motivation to stay active throughout the day, enhancing your performance, Bothra said.
What to keep in mind?
*If you’re just beginning, don’t feel pressured to wake up at 5 am immediately. Ease into it by setting your alarm 30 minutes earlier each week.Advertisement
For example, if you usually wake up at 8 am, try 7:30 am for a week, then slowly advance to 7 am, 6 am, and eventually 5:30 am. “Let your body adapt to this new habit rather than forcing the concept upon it,” said Bothra.
You can include the following activities in your routine
Exercise
Cortisol or stress hormone is highest in the morning, helping us wake up and be alert. But we need to make sure that it doesn’t affect our entire day. “The best way to balance it out is to move! Go for a run, practice yoga asanas, or do your regular workout. It will set a stage for a calmer day,” said Bothra.

Reflect
Reflecting on your thoughts and actions can help you start your day with a purpose. “You can try meditating or simply practicing Pranayama. Focusing on breath will help you reduce the cortisol in your body and bring clarity. You can also try journalling and preparing a to-do list that can guide you throughout the day,” said Bothra.
LearnAdvertisement
Since you are detached from the world for a short period – focus on your learning. “Read a book that helps you develop personally,” said Bothra.
Being consistent with these habits will help you decide how your day would look like for the next 12-15 hours.

For whom does it work better?
According to Bothra, everyone should implement this concept. “It will take your personal and professional growth to another level. You don’t necessarily have to wake up at 5 am. The goal here is to have a quiet time reserved only for yourself. And you need to be serious about using this period for your growth. Always remember that growth is the core of self-love – that’s how you unlock your true potential,” said Bothra.",lifestyle
‘Their values make them powerful and genuine’: Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni talks about her new book on Narayana Murthy and Sudha Murty,"Much has been said and written about the iconic Murthy couple — Infosys co-founder N R Narayana Murthy and his wife and philanthropist Sudha Murty. But giving an insightful glimpse into their childhood years and their enchanting romance along with their enduring marriage is Indian-American author and poet Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni’s new book An Uncommon Love.
“The book also delineates the bitter hardships families have to go through sometimes in pursuing this dream, and how they overcame them,” said Divakaruni about the book that took two years to write.
Some of Divakaruni’s best-selling books are The Palace of Illusions, The Forest of Enchantment, The Last Queen, and Independence.Advertisement
Ahead of the Jaipur Literature Festival’s 17th edition (JLF 2024), from February 1 to 5, the celebrated author, who will be one of the guest speakers and launching her book, talks more about her bond with the couple, her book, and traversing into the non-fiction space for the first time.
Excerpts from an interview.
Why did you choose the Murthy couple as the subject of your book?
It is more like the book chose me! Juggernaut, my publisher for this book, approached me to write this biography, and at first, I hesitated as my forte was fiction. But the more I looked into the Murthys’ life, the more I felt this was a story that people needed to hear — How they rose from humble beginnings, impelled by their entrepreneurial dream and their love and support for each other. And all the hidden, heartbreaking sacrifices they had to make along the way.
Can you take us through what your book delves into?Advertisement
This book is different because it deals with the early life of Sudha and Narayana Murthy, including their childhoods. There’s a lot here that they have never discussed with interviewers before. I’ve focused on how they fell in love, how they overcame family opposition on both sides to get married, and their many early challenges in following the entrepreneurial dream.
What is the most cherished memory of the couple you gathered while researching for the book?
The most cherished memory I gathered was when Sudha wept on the steps of the MIT campus in Boston because she had had to give up the chance to study there and how, when Murthy learned of this, he offered to put her through college there even though it would mean the end of his own entrepreneurial dream. You will have to read the book to discover the romantic resolution of this issue!
Although Sudhaji and Murthy ji were indeed very busy, they made time for me. After many emails back and forth with my questions and their answers, and many Zoom sessions, I went and spent some time with them in their home in Bengaluru. I interviewed them, shadowed them, and asked many questions. They were very generous and honest with their answers. I also spoke to the children, Sudha’s siblings.Advertisement
What is a striking aspect of the couple’s relationship that you think is relevant for the present generation and why?
They are, first and foremost, partners. They nurtured each other’s dreams even though they didn’t always agree with each other. They were both willing to sacrifice for each other. And when they felt they had made mistakes, or hurt each other, they were not afraid to admit their errors to each other.
What makes the Murthy couple so powerful yet so humble in their background?
Their values — especially their desire to give back to society in a significant way, which they held on to through many difficulties — make them powerful and genuine. They have experienced firsthand what it means not to have enough. But I don’t want readers to think this book is about a “perfect” couple.Advertisement

They made plenty of mistakes — and in this book, they share those difficult learning opportunities very frankly with the reader, hoping the reader will learn from their errors. There are several laugh-out-loud moments, especially from their dating days, and tricks Sudha played on Murthy later in their marriage, that will enchant readers.
What is the message that you would like the readers to get from the book?
An important message of the book is: Dream Big; Take risks; If you fail, get up (even if you’re hurting)—and try again.

How excited are you for JLF 2024?Advertisement
I am super excited about JLF 2024, because I will launch the book there, and Sudha Murty will be there onstage for the launch. So the audience will get her take on the book. She is a fantastic speaker.
I want to encourage everyone to attend the Jaipur Lit Fest. It’s an amazing experience. The energy and love for books there is huge. I learn so much each time I attend and listen to other authors. And it’s most invigorating to be around so many enthusiastic readers.
What’s next for you as a writer?
I’m going back to fiction for my next book — writing a magical fantasy novel based on Bengali tales I was told growing up. And yes, like in Palace of Illusions and Forest of Enchantments, this one will also have powerful women at its center.",lifestyle
What happens to your body if you are on a no-sugar diet for a year like Kartik Aaryan?,"A no-sugar diet may seem far from real but actor Kartik Aaryan seems to have surpassed everyone’s expectations. He savoured his favourite sweet rasmalai at the wrap of his next film Chandu Champion recently. Penning a note on Instagram, the actor — fed by the director of the film Kabir Khan — wrote, “This rasmalai tasted like victory! Finally eating sugar after a year! After more than a year of intense preparation and 8 months of day-n-night shoots across the globe, today we complete the shooting journey of #ChanduChampion. And it couldn’t have been sweeter than my fav, Rasmalai – from the Man himself who carved this challenging path for me… you have been a profound inspiration, Sir!”
Let’s explore more about how a no-sugar diet for a year affects the body and whether you and I can also try it.
Quitting or limiting sugar can lead to several positive changes in your body. “Initially, you may experience withdrawal symptoms, but over time, your energy levels stabilise, and mood swings diminish. Your metabolism improves, reducing the risk of obesity and related health issues. Skin health often benefits, with reduced acne and a more youthful appearance,” said Shruti K Bhardwaj, chief dietician, Zydus Hospitals, Ahmedabad.Advertisement
Moreover, cutting sugar can enhance heart health by lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. According to Bhardwaj, one teaspoon of sugar has 20 kcal, so cutting sugar helps insulin sensitivity, and reduces the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. “A diet with limited sugar intake, and sweets supports better dental health, preventing cavities and gum disease,” said Bhardwaj.

Additionally, mental clarity and cognitive function may see improvements as sugar-induced inflammation decreases. Bhardwaj explained that sleep quality tends to enhance, positively impacting overall well-being. “By eliminating empty calories, weight loss becomes achievable, leading to increased self-esteem and confidence,” said Bhardwaj.

But cutting sugar does not mean replacing sugar with jaggery or artificial sweeteners. “Sugar and jaggery both have equal calories. One can avoid outside sweets keeping in mind hidden sugar content,” said Bharwaj, adding one must avoid energy drinks, cold drinks, etc.

Is it for all?
It’s essential to replace refined sugars with whole foods to maintain nutritional balance, Bhardwaj said. “Consultation with a healthcare professional or nutritionist can provide personalised guidance. Overall, limiting sugar can yield transformative health benefits, positively influencing both physical and mental well-being,” said Bharwdwaj.",lifestyle
Union Budget 2024: Nirmala Sitharaman dons ‘Ramar’ blue sari with Bengali kantha embroidery; know significance,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman made a striking statement with her attire at Budget 2024, sending a loud and clear “vocal for local” message.
Clad in a stunning  ‘Rama’ blue and cream-coloured silk sari adorned with traditional kantha embroidery, her sartorial choice echoed her previous Budget Day ensembles and underscored her well-known appreciation for Indian textiles.
Kantha, a time-honoured embroidery technique that originated in Bangladesh (earlier known as East Bengal), involves stitching together layers of vintage saris or dhotis, creating a quilt-like effect with intricate patterns and motifs painstakingly crafted through running stitches. It is known as one of the oldest styles of embroidery in India.Advertisement
Interestingly, the art of Kantha, is derived from the Sanskrit word kantho, for rags.
According to stylist Ambrish Sonari, “With a simple running stitch across the body of the garment forming various patterns (mostly inspired by flora and fauna), the traditional Kantha embroidery is practised by rural women across eastern states to make quilts with old saris.”
The thought behind this needlework was to reuse old clothes and materials and turn them into something new, said Sonari. This is what makes Kantha embroidery the only one of its kind.
Also interesting is the colour of Sitharaman’s sari – Rama or Ramar Blue, said Sonari. He explained that the Ramar blue is inspired by “the blue colour of Lord Rama” and is a traditional colour in silk weaves.Advertisement
“Rama’s skin is blue, which serves as a reminder of his mission on earth and the challenges faced in restoring order and balance,” said Sonari.
For the unversed, the colours of silk weaves come from the pastes and powders that women used to adorn themselves: sandalwood, smoke from the incense, and kumkum powder. And all of these are also offerings to the Gods: the flowers for the garlands, the pastes and powders to adorn the deities, the fruits and vegetables as part of the prasad or prasadam, explained Sonari.
“Viewed that way, the sari is a sacred piece of cloth, linked intrinsically to the land that it blooms from, and braided to the customs, culture and religion of the people,” he said.

This “vocal for local” message echoes through Sitharaman’s past Budget Day attire as well. Last year, she donned a handwoven red ilkal sari featuring Navalagunda embroidery, a special gift from fellow minister Pralhad Joshi. Notably, the chosen embroidery was hand-stitched onto the sari specifically for the occasion.Advertisement
Off-white or cream seems to be a firm favourite for the Finance Minister, who is often seen sporting this hue. In 2021, she opted for a red and off-white pochampally sari, while 2022 saw her in a rusty brown Bomkai sari. In 2020, a vibrant yellow silk sari with a thin blue border graced the occasion, and her debut Budget in 2019 featured a pink Mangalgiri sari with a golden border.
Beyond the handwoven wonders, another stylistic constant of Sitharaman’s budget presentations is the iconic red book. In her first budget, the red book took the form of a traditional bahi khata. However, since 2021, the budget has gone paperless, with the Minister embracing a red-covered tablet to house the digital budget documents.
With the Interim Budget 2024 marking the final budget of the Modi government’s second term, all eyes are on Sitharaman’s policy pronouncements. However, her sartorial choice has once again sparked conversation, highlighting her commitment to promoting Indian textiles and resonating with the “vocal for local” spirit.",lifestyle
You need to learn the South Korean practice of meong for a healthier life,"In a world constantly buzzing with screens and notifications, finding moments of quiet contemplation can feel like a luxury. That’s where meong, a simple yet profound Korean wellness practice, comes in. Pronounced “muh-uhng,” meong translates to “to stare blankly” or “to gaze vacantly,” but it’s far from mindless. It’s about intentionally entering a state of present-moment awareness through focused staring, often at nature.
Imagine yourself perched on a rocky cliff overlooking the vastness of the ocean. You close your eyes, but instead of darkness, you’re met with a kaleidoscope of colours dancing behind your eyelids. You open your eyes and fix your gaze on the rhythmic dance of the waves, the salty breeze whisking away your worries. This state of tranquil observation, free from thoughts and judgments, is the essence of meong.
Dr Rituparna Ghosh, consultant senior clinical psychologist, Apollo Hospitals, Navi Mumbai, explained that meong is used as a suffix in the Korean language to describe the act of “staring into stillness”.Advertisement
“Meong refers to activities such as ‘bull meong’ or staring into the fire, or staring at nature (trees or water) as a restorative practice. This is explained as a form of zoning out mindfully and shares parallels with Indian meditation and yoga, which also help to achieve calm and awareness of the present moment. You may be aware of a yogic meditation technique where one focuses on a single object like a candle flame. Known as ‘trataka’, this is a Sanskrit word that means “to look” or “to gaze”,” she tells indianexpress.com in an interaction.
Why can it be hard to practice meong for some?
We live in a world where there is intense stimulation of our minds and our senses. This is what makes it difficult to sit quietly in a room alone for some people.
 We are conditioned to seek constant engagement and this makes it challenging for us to face stillness, work on mind calmness and solitude without discomfort (Image source: GettyImages)
“A constant need for stimulation, discomfort with introspection, or an underlying feeling of anxiety is the result of our fast-paced, technology-driven lifestyle,” said Dr Ghosh.
What is its benefits?
The practices of meong, meditation and yoga train our minds to be comfortable alone in silence, allowing for introspection and fostering self-awareness. Stress is also reduced and one also feels fresh and rejuvenated with enhanced focus, said Dr Ghosh, adding that the practice can also improve mental resilience and over time can help in achieving better emotional balance and a deeper sense of peace.Advertisement
How can you practice meong?

Find a calm environment: Choose a quiet place with minimal distractions, such as a park, your backyard, or even your living room.
Focus on your senses: Observe the sights, sounds, smells, and textures around you without judgment. Pay attention to your breath and the sensations in your body.
Let go of expectations: Don’t force yourself to see anything specific or achieve a certain state of mind. Simply allow yourself to be present in the moment.
Start small: Begin with short periods of meong, such as 5-10 minutes, and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable.

While meong may seem passive, it can be a surprisingly transformative experience. You might find yourself lost in the intricate patterns of a spiderweb, captivated by the dance of sunlight on leaves, or overcome with a sense of awe at the vastness of the universe.",lifestyle
"A 93-year-old athlete is as healthy as a 40-year-old, according to science. These are his secrets","At 93, Richard Morgan is as fit as someone half his age. The Irishman became the subject of a recent analysis, published last month in the Journal of Applied Physiology, focusing on his training regimen, diet, and overall health.
The retired baker informed the Irish Examiner that he had “never really played sports” until he commenced regular exercise at the age of 73.
During the study, conducted when he was 92, Morgan, a four-time world champion in indoor rowing, demonstrated heart health, muscle mass, and overall fitness measures more comparable to a healthy 30- or 40-year-old than to another nonagenarian.Advertisement
“I started from nowhere,” Morgan told the Washington Post regarding his exercise routine. One day he “suddenly realized there was a lot of pleasure in doing this.”
While Morgan may possess certain genetic advantages, the researchers stated that at least some of his good health is connected to the routine he initiated two decades ago at the age of 73. The study identified key factors contributing to his fitness in his 90s: the importance of consistency for long-term results, the notion that it is never too late to start exercising, and adhering to a high-protein diet like Morgan’s.

Dr Sunil G Kini, consultant – orthopaedic & robotic joint replacement surgery, Manipal Hospitals, said there’s no age limit to beginning an exercise regimen, and the benefits are evident regardless of when you start. However, he added that it’s often advised that the earlier you commence, the greater the advantages.
According to Dr Ratnakar Rao, HOD – sr. consultant joint replacements and arthroscopic surgeon, CARE Hospitals, potential benefits of exercising at an older age include improved cardiovascular health, enhanced mobility, better muscle strength, and reduced risk of chronic conditions like heart disease and diabetes. It can also contribute to mental well-being and help maintain independence.Advertisement
Here is a list of dos and don’ts if you’ve started exercising late in life.
Dos:
a. Consult with your healthcare provider before starting any exercise program.
b. Start with low-impact exercises and gradually progress to higher intensity activities.
c. Include a mix of aerobic exercises (e.g., walking, swimming) and strength training.
d. Listen to your body and pay attention to any signs of pain or discomfort.
e. Stay hydrated and maintain a balanced diet to support your fitness goals.
f. Include flexibility exercises to improve joint mobility and reduce the risk of injury.
g. Choose activities you enjoy to make it more sustainable in the long term.

b. Avoid high-impact activities if you have joint issues. Opt for low-impact alternatives.
c. Don’t neglect warm-up and cool-down exercises to prepare your body and prevent injuries.
d. Avoid exercising through pain. If you experience persistent discomfort, consult your healthcare provider.

It is never too late to start taking care of your health, but it’s crucial to do so with a thoughtful and gradual approach, considering your individual circumstances and seeking guidance from healthcare professionals.",lifestyle
Ishaan Khatter slays it on the Pilates reformer with quality reps,"In fitness, it is all about quality over quantity. As such, when actor Ishaan Khatter focused on the quality of repetitions in his Pilates class, his trainer Namrata Purohit couldn’t keep calm. The Pilates trainer took to her Instagram to share a video of the actor working out with her and expressed, “Always a pleasure training someone who understands the body, listens and connects well! It’s so important to understand that the quality of movement is far more important than the quantity or reps! And @ishaankhatter really gets it! And I love it!”
Khatter can be seen doing activities like leg circles, and chest expansion on the reformer.
Taking a cue, we decided to explore why the quality of movement matters more.Advertisement
Quality of movement underscores the point that performing exercises with proper form and control, and prioritising precision over sheer quantity of repetitions is what matters. “While the number of repetitions can contribute to overall volume and workload, it is the quality of each movement that truly determines the effectiveness and safety of an exercise routine,” said fitness expert Garima Goyal.
Maintaining correct body alignment, engaging the targeted muscles, and moving through the full range of motion are some of the requirements. “In contrast, mindlessly chasing a high number of repetitions without regard for form can lead to inefficient workouts, increased risk of injury, and limited long-term progress,” added Goyal.
Consider the example of a common strength-training exercise like the squat. “Executing a squat with proper form involves maintaining a neutral spine, engaging the core, and ensuring that the knees track over the toes. Focusing on the quality of each squat, rather than simply aiming for a high number of repetitions, allows for better muscle activation in the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. This targeted engagement contributes to muscle growth, strength development, and overall functional fitness,” Goyal explained.
Additionally, prioritising quality over quantity enhances proprioception and body awareness. “Mindful movement fosters a stronger mind-muscle connection, where individuals become more attuned to the sensations and feedback from their bodies during exercise. This heightened awareness facilitates better control over movements, reducing the risk of injuries caused by poor form or improper technique,” said Goyal.Advertisement
A high quantity of repetitions often leads to fatigue and a decline in form, diminishing the effectiveness of the workout. “Not only does this hinder progress, but it also increases the risk of injury as fatigue compromises motor control and coordination,” said Goyal.
Tips for a beginner
Start slowly – Begin with manageable workouts that match your current fitness level. Gradually increase intensity and duration as your strength and endurance improve.
Focus on form – Pay close attention to proper form and technique in every exercise. This lays a solid foundation and reduces the risk of injuries as you progress.
Set realistic goals – Establish achievable, short-term goals to track your progress. This helps maintain motivation and gives you a sense of accomplishment.
Consistency – Regular, consistent workouts are more beneficial than sporadic intense sessions. Establish a realistic schedule that fits into your routine.

Variety – Include a variety of exercises to keep things interesting and engage different muscle groups. This prevents boredom and provides a more comprehensive fitness experience.
Listen to your body – Pay attention to how your body feels during and after workouts. If something doesn’t feel right, modify or skip the exercise. Rest when needed.
Warm-up and cool down – Always warm up before exercising to prepare your muscles and joints. Similarly, cool down to help your heart rate return to normal and reduce muscle soreness.
Stay hydrated and eat well – Proper hydration is essential for overall health and performance. Maintain a balanced diet that includes a mix of nutrients to support your fitness goals.
Be patient – Results take time. Don’t get discouraged if progress seems slow. Consistency and perseverance are key to long-term success in fitness.",lifestyle
Beyond 9 to 5: How you can navigate side hustles with full-time jobs,"Ria Chopra, 25, has always had a keen interest in writing. Despite securing a placement in a top-notch management consulting firm after college, she found herself pulled into the world of freelance journalism in 2020. “Initially, I considered it a one-off or side hobby, not anticipating it would evolve into a significant side hustle,” she said.
The positive reception to her freelance articles motivated Chopra to turn it into a more serious gig. Additionally, her consulting job and writing complemented each other well. “The logical thinking from consulting enhanced my writing skills while penning articles gave me a creative outlook towards my job.”
Over time, Chopra’s side hustle has become one of her main income generators. She is among the many individuals who started side gigs due to an impetus through the remote work phenomenon during the pandemic that enabled employees to find spare time.Advertisement
Karan Cheema, a Delhi-based professional, also discovered a digital marketing course online while working from home, pushing him to pursue it as a side gig. From working in an e-commerce startup to a fintech giant, Cheema simultaneously worked hard to build his own digital marketing agency — Witty Web Studio — oftentimes working overnight and losing out on sleep.
“I always knew in my heart that I wanted to do something of my own. I never wanted to be part of the rat race, working 9 to 5, and only contributing a fraction, so I used every bit of my remaining energy to build my side hustle,” he said.
However, soon things started going downhill. “Time management became super hard, and I started missing out on opportunities in my main job,” Cheema said, adding that “it was time to leave my job and fully focus on my own endeavours.”
Yashika Yadav, working at Madchatter, a public relations firm, found her boss to be the “loudest cheerleader” for her side hustle. Specialising in personalised handmade products using Macrame, a handicraft, Yadav started her small business in 2022. Guided by YouTube tutorials, the Gurgaon-based professional dedicated her weekends to creating Macrame products.

“My first corporate order was from my own company — personalised dreamcatchers for Diwali gifting,” she said about how her employers supported her.Advertisement
On the other hand, Merin Mariya, associate director at a corporate firm, manages four side gigs with her full-time job — modelling, content writing, anchoring, and freelance PR projects. She said side hustles become essential in an uncertain job market where layoffs and economic instability are rampant.
“To safeguard one’s livelihood, it’s prudent to establish a contingency plan. By having a backup income source in place, even if a full-time position were to disappear, one can avoid the stress and anxiety associated with financial instability. This provides the flexibility to search for a new job at a measured pace while ensuring that daily expenses are met without disruption,” she said.
Research conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2021 discovered that out of the 10,348 respondents, 56 per cent cited wanting to save up extra money, 52 per cent needing to cover gaps or changes in their income, and 49 per cent as being able to control their own schedule.
However, for some businesses, side hustles present unique challenges. According to Murali Santhanam, chief human resources officer at AscentHR, his company, like many others, restricts double employment as it is a contractual breach. Though it does not have a specific policy for side hustles, having witnessed several employees engaging in this, Santhanam observed a decline in their performance.Advertisement
Double employment or moonlighting is not to be confused with side hustles. While the former refers to having a second job, typically at night, the latter encompasses various income-generating activities beyond regular employment.
On the other hand, Aditya Joshi, CEO and MD at OpalForce, actively encourages his employees to explore side hustles. “Our main stipulation is ensuring these ventures do not conflict with our business interests or hinder workplace productivity,” he said.
Joshi believes those who pursue side hustles are quite focused and adept at maintaining a healthy balance between their job and entrepreneurial activities. “Engaging in side hustles can be beneficial as it offers people a perspective on management and business leadership.”
In fact, a 2021 study in the Academy of Management found that side hustles empowered individuals, making them feel like agents in charge of their work, which led to being emotionally and cognitively invested in the side hustle. Workers even carried forward the positive emotions to their full-time jobs, ultimately improving their performance.Advertisement
So, how can you successfully start and maintain a side hustle?
 Multitasking can compromise personal well-being. (Source: Freepik)
According to Chopra, the first step in embarking on a successful side hustle journey is to identify your passion and skills.
“Consider what you enjoy doing in your free time and your talents. This foundation will make your side hustle more fulfilling and increase the likelihood of long-term success.”
Next is to ensure that you are compliant with employment agreements. “Be open and transparent with your employer and seek permission if necessary to avoid conflicts of interest,” Pooja Inamke, industrial psychologist and counsellor, said.
Additionally, time management is crucial, explained Srinithi Sridhar, counselling psychologist. “It is essential to have a dedicated schedule that helps you manage your different expectations and allows you to maintain consistency. Blocking out selected hours for ideating, creating, implementation, revision, and marketing can go a long way in helping you build this schedule. Take time out to experiment with the energy and time you have to create this schedule.”Advertisement
Multitasking can compromise personal well-being, so prioritising self-care — such as adequate sleep, exercise and downtime — is essential, suggested Inamke.
Cheema recommends individuals to “treat your side hustle like an expensive pet”. “You can’t sustain yourself or your pet without work, so always prioritise your main job, primarily because that’s the source of your income which gives you the resources to work on your side hustle. The day your side hustle gives you a return bigger than your main job is the day you can change your priorities.”
Successfully juggling a side hustle with a full-time job is undoubtedly challenging, but with determination and effective planning, it is possible to navigate both spheres.
“There will be setbacks and failures. Understand that this journey is a marathon rather than a sprint,” Inamke said.Advertisement

"Can dietary changes help you achieve glowing, radiant skin?","What we eat does play its part in how our skin looks and feels. This is why, experts urge for optimum nutrition that takes care of our dietary as well as skincare needs. As such, Dr Aanchal Panth, a dermatologist, took to Instagram to share a few dietary tweaks that cannot be overlooked.
“We cannot overlook the role of diet and lifestyle on healthy skin. Here are a few dietary changes, which can make a positive difference to your skin,” said Dr Panth as she listed them out.

Add nuts and seeds: They are rich in omega-3 fatty acids which are good for both skin and hair.
Avoid sugar, reduce salt: Packaged food has high salt content and so do pickles.
Green leafy vegetables, bell peppers, and tomatoes: Coloured food is rich in antioxidants. Tomatoes have high levels of lycopene, said Dr Panth.
High protein and high fibre diet: Indian vegetarian diet is low in protein. “Add high protein items in diet at least in one meal a day is important such as lentils, legumes, green peas, soya, tofu, beans, and peanuts,” said Dr Panth.
No to fried and roasted food: The way food is prepared is also an important contributing factor to ultimate nutritional value. “Cooking food in low heat settings is preferred,” said Dr Panth.
Lemon juice, vinegar: Adding lemon juice and vinegar improves digestion and has probiotic properties, said Dr Panth.

Diet plays a crucial role in achieving and maintaining healthy skin, experts opine. “We advocate for a holistic approach to skincare, emphasising that what you eat significantly impacts the health and appearance of your skin. A well-rounded, nutrient-rich diet can complement your skincare routine and contribute to a glowing complexion,” said Dr Rinky Kapoor, consultant dermatologist, cosmetic dermatologist, and dermato-surgeon, The Esthetic Clinics.Advertisement
Firstly, hydration is key; dermatologists emphasise the importance of drinking an adequate amount of water to keep the skin well-hydrated and supple.
Furthermore, a diet rich in antioxidants, found in fruits and vegetables, can protect the skin from oxidative stress and promote a youthful appearance. Omega-3 fatty acids, present in fish and flaxseeds, have anti-inflammatory properties beneficial for skin health, said Dr Kapoor.
Reducing the intake of processed foods and sugars is advised, as these can contribute to inflammation and skin issues. Dermatologists often recommend incorporating foods with high collagen content or taking collagen supplements to promote skin elasticity and firmness, mentioned Dr Kapoor.

18 subtle red flags to look out for in a relationship,"Embarking on a new romantic relationship is a thrilling journey filled with excitement and hope. However, it’s essential to navigate this landscape with a discerning eye, being attuned to potential warning signs that may indicate an unhealthy dynamic. Recognising red flags early on is crucial for building a foundation of trust, respect, and emotional well-being. Let us explore key indicators that may signal potential issues in a relationship, empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their romantic endeavours.
Anu Rajgarhia, psychologist, Mpower, noted the importance of understanding that “one or two isolated instances do not constitute a red flag. It is only when the same unhelpful behaviour happens repeatedly that it is considered cause for concern.”
How can you recognise subtle red flags in a relationship?
The following are some indicators of red flags in a relationship:

If any of the partners attempts to control or restrict the other person’s decisions, friendships.
Demeans, belittles and dismisses the other person’s opinions, needs, feelings.
Has no respect for the partner’s boundaries and violates them without thought.
Finds fault with most of the actions, and decisions of the partner. Criticises the partner to control or manipulate.
The partner does not find it safe to express his/her needs, and feelings as the other puts him/her down immediately. As a result,they are never able to have important conversations.
Unresolved conflicts leading to a pattern of arguments repeatedly without any way to move ahead.
Lying, being evasive and not being transparent about his/her aspects of life.
Excessive jealousy and always distrusts the partner without valid reason.
Any form of abuse – verbal, physical, or emotional.
Does not stand by/support the partner during challenging times.
Belittles the partner’s achievements.
Threatening or manipulating the partner using guilt or shaming.
Emotionally or otherwise pressurising the partner to do things.
Oversharing too early in the relationship.
One partner feels he/she is doing a lot of giving in the relationship. Relationships are about give and take.
One partner is very dependent on the other. Or one partner tries to create excessive dependency.
If the relationship feels stuck – like it is not having any direction.
One of them can’t seem to hold onto a job.

Rajgarhia added that red flags need not always be a deal breaker. “When awareness sets in, the partners have the choice to change and be cognisant of the habits that are not helpful in the relationship.” If they show the willingness to change, agree to take help in changing [in case they can’t do it by themselves], and are committed to working towards building a strong relationship, then the relationship can be saved.",lifestyle
What happens if you add raisins into your diet every day?,"Most of us struggle with a variety of health issues that stem from a lack of immunity. While improving your immunity is an ongoing process, simple diet tweaks can aid it. One such is having munakka, or black grape raisins, which offer various health benefits. However, many of us aren’t aware that soaking them overnight can enhance their nutritional value. Here’s what experts have to say.
“Soaking munakka in water overnight enhances its nutritional profile and makes it more digestible,” said Dr Ranga Santosh Kumar, consultant general physician and diabetologist, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad.
Experts also suggest that it is effective in relieving dry cough and respiratory tract inflammation owing to its cough suppressant and soothing properties.Advertisement
In addition to these benefits, soaked munakka offers a quick energy boost owing to its natural sugars. “The augmented water content not only aids in digestion but also contributes to hydration, promoting overall well-being,” said Dr Dilip Gude, senior consultant physician, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad.
Dr Kumar explained 5 key reasons to include soaked munakka in your diet:

Digestive health: Soaking munakka softens the dried fruit, making it easier to digest and relieving issues like constipation. The increased fibre content supports overall digestive well-being.

2. Natural laxative: Munakka acts as a gentle natural laxative, aiding in promoting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation. Agreed Dr Gude, and shared, “This natural laxative effect is attributed to the heightened fibre content, supporting regular bowel movements.”
3. Iron absorption: Munakka is a good source of iron, and soaking it can enhance iron absorption. This is particularly beneficial for individuals with iron-deficiency anaemia. “Munakka serves as a significant source of iron, and the soaking process enhances iron absorption. This is especially advantageous for individuals managing iron-deficiency anemia, contributing to improved iron levels in the body,” said Dr Gude.Advertisement
4. Antioxidant boost: Munakka contains antioxidants that help combat oxidative stress, reducing inflammation and supporting overall health.
5. Energy and hydration: The natural sugars in munakka provide a quick energy boost, while the increased water content contributes to hydration.

"From Billie Eilish to Bella Hadid, glasses are becoming the hottest accessory of 2024","In the ever-evolving landscape of fashion, trends come and go, but some styles manage to make a triumphant comeback, redefining coolness in unexpected ways.
As we step into 2024, it seems that geek chic is experiencing a renaissance, with glasses making a bold return to the forefront of fashion. The once-dismissed accessory is now reclaiming its status as a symbol of intelligence, individuality, and, dare we say it, geeky charm.
The Rise of Geek Chic
The transformation of the geeky aesthetic into a fashion statement has been gradual but steady. The stereotype of the bespectacled nerd has been replaced by a more nuanced and stylish image that combines intellect with a keen sense of fashion.Advertisement
Designer Shilpi Gupta noted that librarian glasses add versatility to any outfit. “By pairing them with casual outfits, you can exude sophistication and charm. Pairing them with formal outfits will reflect intellectual flair,” stated Shilpi Gupta.
Glasses: A Fashion Staple
Glasses have transcended their utilitarian purpose of vision correction to become a key accessory in the fashion realm. Designers are now incorporating eyewear into their collections, recognising the unique ability of glasses to add character and flair to any outfit.
From oversized frames to sleek, minimalist designs, glasses are no longer just for those who need them – they’re for anyone who wants to make a statement.

A quick glance at red carpets and social media reveals that celebrities are proudly sporting glasses as a fashion statement. A-listers, influencers, and musicians are choosing eyewear that complements their personal style, turning what was once considered a functional necessity into a bold and intentional fashion choice.Advertisement
Embracing the Geek Chic Revolution
As glasses make a grand comeback, individuals are embracing the opportunity to express themselves through their geeky style. Here’s how to embrace geek chic yourself.

Statement Glasses:

The hallmark of geek chic fashion often starts with eyewear. Invest in a pair of stylish frames that not only correct your vision but also make a bold statement. Whether it’s oversized vintage frames, cat-eye glasses, or sleek minimalist designs, the right pair of glasses can instantly elevate your entire look, said Gupta.

Graphic Tees with a Twist:

Graphic tees featuring your favorite fandoms, references to classic video games, or nods to science and technology are a staple of geek chic. Look for shirts with clever designs, witty slogans, or iconic symbols that reflect your interests. These tees can be paired with jeans, skirts, or even layered under blazers for a casual yet stylish ensemble.

Accessorise with Tech:

Incorporate tech-inspired accessories into your wardrobe to add a futuristic flair. Smartwatches, futuristic jewellery, or accessories with circuit board patterns can subtly show your love for all things tech. These accessories not only enhance your geek chic aesthetic but also showcase your passion for innovation.Advertisement

Mix Prints and Patterns:

Geek chic fashion embraces bold and eclectic combinations of prints and patterns. Experiment with mixing geeky motifs, such as pixel art, science symbols, or comic book prints. Don’t be afraid to pair unconventional patterns – the key is to express your personality and showcase your unique style.
Gupta recommended including high-waisted pants, patterns, and prints that add scholarly and vintage touches to your wardrobe. “Mix and match textures like tweed, wool, and accessories accordingly to create a modern and stylish outfit.”

Layering and Texture Play:

Layering contributes to adding visual depth to the outfit. Combine collar shirts with vests and sweaters to achieve a polished aesthetic, said Gupta.
Experiment with layering different pieces, like a geeky graphic tee under a blazer or a cozy cardigan. Mixing textures, such as pairing a leather jacket with a soft, nerdy-themed scarf, can add depth and interest to your ensemble.Advertisement
Once relegated to the sidelines, glasses have taken center stage in the fashion world, proving that embracing one’s unique style, interests, and quirks is not just trendy but empowering.

"New mothers, keep these nutritional points in mind after giving birth","The postpartum period is an exciting yet daunting experience for new mothers. Choosing the right diet can help promote healing and maintain energy levels during this turbulent time.
The mother’s body goes through so many emotional and physical changes during pregnancy. Even after delivering her baby, there can be a certain weakness in the body, for which she needs time to recover from. Dr Anjana Singh, director & HOD, obstetrics and gynaecology, Fortis Hospital, Noida tells indianexpress.com that the main focus after delivery, whether it is normal or caesarean, is for the mother to recover properly and subsequently pay attention to their breastfeeding needs. “So, the nutrition of the mother should be designed around achieving both the targets for herself and the baby,” she said.
According to Dr Singh, maintaining your diet during this period is important. “A well-balanced diet with extra 500 calories i.e. 1800 to 2200 kcal per day rich in proteins, vitamins, calcium and fluids, low-fat dairy products, veggies, fruits and high-fibre carbohydrates, and galactagogues (agents improving breast milk) is ideal.”Advertisement
Highlighting the same through an Instagram post, Mahima Sethia, a nutritionist, advised including vegetables to one’s postpartum diet. “Green vegetables are also low in calories and rich in heart-healthy antioxidants, which help in losing post-pregnancy weight,” she said in an Instagram post.

One of the best veggies to regain strength postpartum is turai (ridge gourd). “Turai strengthens liver functioning, purifies the blood, and regulates blood glucose levels. Rich in fibre, this superfood also helps maintain appropriate weight during postpartum,” Sethia mentioned in her post.
Many times, new mothers think they need to avoid carbohydrates to decrease weight postpartum, but Dr Singh said that’s not a positive approach. “Carbohydrates are necessary for new moms — not just for breast milk production but also for mental health, hormone regulation, and more.”
During this period, women often suffer from dehydration too, for which intake of liquids should be considered. “Herbal teas and coconut water can also provide additional nutrients and hydration along with aiding digestion,” Dr Payal Chaudhary, senior consultant, obstetrics and gynaecology, Rosewalk Healthcare, said.
Additionally, Dr Singh points out that keeping yourself hydrated with loads of water and fluids, such as soups, juices, and coconut water, and at least 4 glasses of milk is required. “Water can be infused with ajwain or methi (fenugreek) and saunf (fennel) granules to increase the quantity of breast milk.”Advertisement

“Alcohol and caffeine should be avoided postpartum,” Dr Singh advised.
Dr Roli Banthia, consultant in Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Yatharth Super Speciality Hospital, Noida Extension shared a list of dietary habits to new mothers must keep in mind:
*Lean proteins: Incorporate sources such as poultry, fish, lean meats, eggs, and legumes to aid in tissue repair and muscle recovery.
*Fruits and vegetables: Rich in essential vitamins and minerals, these foods provide antioxidants and fibre, supporting overall health and digestion.
*Whole grains: Opt for whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, and oats to boost energy levels and aid in bowel regularity.
*Healthy fats: Include sources such as avocados, nuts, and olive oil to support brain health and hormone production.
*Hydration: Adequate water intake is vital for maintaining hydration, especially if breastfeeding. Aim for at least 8-10 glasses of water daily.",lifestyle
New research suggests energy drinks linked to sleep problems in university students; here is what can help,"A new study published in the BMJ Open medical journal suggests that university students drinking energy drinks to stay alert could possibly be facing negative consequences.
It is not uncommon for college kids these days to just slosh bottles of energy drinks to pull off an all-nighter before that one exam that’s bringing your whole grade down (guilty as charged). But according to these new findings, those who regularly drank these energy drinks were more likely to have insomnia, a sleeping condition. “The results from the current study show that there is a robust association between the frequency of (energy drink) consumption and the different sleep parameters,” researchers of the study, Siri Kaldenbach of the Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine at Innlandet Hospital Trust in Lillehammer, Norway, wrote.
Concurring with the findings of the study, Dr Mickey Mehta, holistic health coach, tells indianexpress.com in an interaction that artificial energy drinks typically have a lot of caffeine, sugar, and other chemical stimulants.Advertisement
“These stimulants keep you extremely alert, accelerate your heart rate, cause nervousness and difficulty in relaxing—all of which can negatively impact our brain, putting it into hyperactive mode,” he said. “This flux of high and low puts your circadian rhythm in a flux and can interfere with the normal sleep-wake cycle.”
While energy drinks might be alluring, Dr Mehta suggests individuals not to drink them before bedtime.
This is in cognizance with previous studies done on the same topic. According to a 2017 research paper published in the journal Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment, “up to 60% of all college students suffer from poor sleep quality, and 7.7% meet all criteria of an insomnia disorder.”
If you’re still into energy drinks, Dr Mehta advises these options. “We should have natural energy drinks that don’t spike your energy in high speed. Instead, it goes up naturally and gradually, after that the drop also has no side effects.”Advertisement
Here are some ways to naturally increase your energy throughout the day:
*Herbal teas: Peppermint or chamomile provides a soothing and caffeine-free option.
*Green tea, although containing a moderate amount of caffeine, is an antioxidant with a milder energy boost.
*Using organic jaggery, rock salt, a little bit of saffron, and naturally squeezed lemon juice or orange juice can become a great energy drink without a spike in unnatural sugar and caffeine.
“These mildly regulated drinks do not get our system into a flux,” said Dr Mehta. “Also, consuming nutrient-rich snacks such as fruits, nuts, and seeds can provide a steady release of energy. Include a mix of whole grains, lean proteins, veggies, and good fats in your meals,” he added.Advertisement

"‘Udd Gaye’ singer Ritviz on importance of live concerts, composing for Bollywood, and why he finds it hard to describe his music","Best known for songs like ‘Liggi’, ‘Udd Gaye’, and ‘Sage’, Ritviz Srivastava feels extremely lucky and blessed to have the journey he has had. But he admits that, as a child, he had no idea that music would be his calling. Now, after so many concerts, popular tracks, and a hit first album under his belt, the artist feels content with all that he has achieved and looks forward to continuing to do what he loves doing the most. But despite tasting success with his unique compositions, the artist finds it extremely hard to describe his music: “This is the hardest thing to answer,” he tells us.
In an exclusive email interview, Srivastava also talks about being an independent musician in India, the associated challenges, the importance of live performances, and what we can expect from him in 2024. Read the edited excerpts below:

1. From ‘Udd Gaye’, your first song, to Mimmi, your first album — how has your journey been?Advertisement
Srivastava: My journey feels surreal. It feels unreal to look back at everything that has happened and how things fell into place. I am extremely grateful to the people who have enabled this journey, and the support that the audience showed to the music. This is my evolution as a human, and all of the music that we’re hearing is a reflection of that. I’m thankful that the people have enjoyed the journey and I hope they continue to do so.
2. But when did you realise that music is what you wanted to pursue?
Srivastava: Honestly, I did not know that music would take centre stage. In school, I was a very creative child. I used to think I would be a writer because back then I was writing and painting. While I was also making music, I didn’t know what domain I would follow. Only after 10th grade did music start taking more time in my life. However, I am still involved in the other aspects of music, like artwork and lyric writing. So, in a way, all three domains – writing, painting, and making music – are getting satisfied.
3. What would you rate as the most challenging thing about being an independent musician in India?Advertisement
Srivastava: I count myself very lucky to have had the journey I have had because the challenge usually begins at home. I am blessed to have such supportive parents and the trust and faith that they reposed in me to pursue and express freely without worrying about anything – so that my musician self could be itself. Once these challenges were taken care of, the sky was the limit. However, I want to mention that since most independent musicians have no labels backing them, it’s a very tough journey. But I feel my challenges are more internal (within the music and how I deal with them).
4. How was your performance at Zomaland Hyderabad?
Srivastava: Hyderabad is one of my favourite cities to perform in the country. The energy is always very high, and I remember that my first few gigs in Hyderabad were very exciting. Even today, the progression has been lovely to see and I’m really glad that people are still inviting me to the city. I will not forget to mention the feast that we look forward to in the city. So, everything excites me: the energy, people, the music, and Zomaland feels like home.

5. How would you describe your style of music?
Srivastava: This is the hardest thing to answer. While it’s reached a point with the popularity, still I never really know what box to put it in. However, considering where it is right now, Indian pop is my best bet. I always like to jump out of boxes that way, and the fact that there is no identity (genre) yet keeps me excited about the mystery that my music can be.
6. ‘Udd Gaye’ is completely different from the songs in Mimmi. Did you fear losing out on your audience (who liked you for a particular type of music)?Advertisement
Srivastava: From day one, I have been clear about what I do and why I want to do it. It all began from the kind of music I like, which inspires what I make. I am so grateful that people joined and enjoyed it. In a way, my listeners and I are both fans of my music. But, as I evolve as a person, I think changing the music will also change that way I think. There is a possibility that people who like my initial music might not like the new stuff. But it could also be that there is a new crowd who likes the new stuff – after all, we are all evolving at our own pace. The idea is to always continue being yourself and hope that the right sort of people will come join you.

7. With success comes pressure to meet audience expectations. How do you deal with it?
Srivastava: Honestly, I wasn’t even expecting there would be an audience in the beginning. It was very overwhelming to see the response; and then obviously expectations are set. But I think reminders from the people who have been with me and are my closest, and being clear about what I do and why I do it help. Since it anyway began not with an audience in my mind but because I liked the kind of sound that I was making, the process was really exciting.Advertisement
8. How important are live concerts for independent artists, and why?
Srivastava: They are very important primarily because independent artists often lack label backing. This makes live performances a significant revenue source. Even if their music gains popularity, streaming alone might not be enough as a primary revenue source. Furthermore, live concerts offer discoverability, although this factor has become secondary with the advent of the internet.

9. Is composing for Bollywood on the cards?
Srivastava: For me it has always been on the cards. I have also had the opportunity to work with some fun people and there are also some projects in the works. I don’t view it as a separate domain; as long as there are like-minded individuals, the project takes centre stage, and anything is possible.
10. What can we expect from you in 2024?
Srivastava: Currently, my sophomore album is in the works. While I cannot predict if it will be completed in 2024, there will certainly be new singles, more shows, and celebrations.",lifestyle
Breaking the silence: Cervical cancer awareness unveiled,"Cervical cancer is a condition where there is an abnormal growth of the cells lining the cervix (the part that connects the uterus and the vagina) or the lower portion of the uterus.
The infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common cause (about 90%) of cervical cancer.
Every 2 minutes a woman is dying worldwide because of cervical cancer – a cancer which can be eliminated. In India, nearly 1 person dies of HPV related cancer every 5 minutes. 
As per the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of cervical cancer in 2020 was estimated to be 6,04,000 new cases and 3,42,000 deaths, marking it as the fourth most prominent cancer in women.  India accounts for nearly one-fourth of global cases of cervical cancer every year, with a mortality rate of nearly one-third.                    
WHAT IS HPV? 
HPV is a common virus that can be passed from one person to another during sex.  
There are around 150 different types of HPV. At least 14 types of HPV known as high-risk types can cause 6 types of cancer in men and women: cancer of cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus and oropharynx.  
HPV infects both men and women alike. 
HPV is spread skin to skin primarily during sexual contact.
An estimated > 50% – 80% will get at least one type of HPV infection in their lifetime.
HPV usually causes no symptoms and for most people, HPV will go away on its own in about 2 years; however, if it does not, there is a chance that over time it may cause cervical cancer. 
WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS FOR CERVICAL CANCER?

 Persistent infection with high-risk types of HPV.
 Having HIV.
 Tobacco smoking.

WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF CERVICAL CANCER?
Early on, cervical cancer may not cause signs and symptoms. 
Advanced cervical cancer may cause unusual bleeding between periods, after menopause, or after sexual intercourse, increased or foul-smelling vaginal discharge, symptoms like persistent pain in the back, legs, or pelvis, weight loss, fatigue and loss of appetite, vaginal discomfort, swelling in the legs.
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR CERVICAL CANCER TO DEVELOP?
Research has shown that HPV infected cells can develop into cancerous tumor 10-20 years after infection or even longer too. Therefore, regular screening and vaccination are important. The purpose of cervical cancer screening is to detect these changes while they are still easily treatable.
WHAT CAN ONE DO TO REDUCE THE RISK OF CERVICAL CANCER ? 

Taking vaccination against HPV.
Screening, early diagnosis and treatment of pre-cancerous lesions.
Abstaining from smoking.

WHAT IS HPV VACCINE AND WHO CAN TAKE IT?
The HPV vaccine protects against the types of HPV that most often cause cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancers.
There are 6 HPV Vaccines available globally and all of them protect against the high-risk HPV types 16 and 18.
BIVALENT (HPV 16,18)
QUADRIVALENT (HPV 16,18,6,11)
NANO VALENT (HPV 16,18,6,11,31,33,45,52,58)
Dosing schedule:
On Time: AGES 9-14  yrs: 2 doses (at 0, 6 month)
Late/ Extra dose: AGES: 15-26 yrs: 3 doses (at 0, 2 and 6 month)
Immunocompromised:  ANY AGE: 3 doses (at 0, 2 and 6 month)
HPV vaccination prevents new HPV infections but does not treat existing infections or diseases. This is why the HPV vaccine works best when given before any exposure to HPV. One should get screened for cervical cancer regularly, even if one has received an HPV vaccine.
WHAT SCREENING TESTS ARE AVAILABLE?
HPV test and the Pap test are screening tests that can help identify pre-cancerous disease or cervical cancer early.

The human papillomavirus (HPV) test looks for the virus that can cause cell changes on the cervix.
The Pap test (or Pap smear) looks for precancers, which are cell changes on the cervix that might become cervical cancer if they are not treated appropriately.

WHAT ARE THE SCREENING OPTIONS AVAILABLE?
FOR WOMEN AGED 21 TO 30 YRS: Pap smears every 3 years.
AGE: 30 TO 65 YRS:  There are 3 screening options.
HPV testing alone: To be repeated every 5 years.
HPV testing along with pap smear: To be repeated every 5 years.
Pap testing alone: To be repeated every 3 years.
AGE MORE THAN 65 YRS:  
No need of screening if previous results are normal.
No need of screening if cervix along with uterus is removed for benign conditions.
World cervical cancer awareness month is a global healthcare event observed for the entire month of January every year, its aim to raise awareness of cervical cancer globally. 
LEARN. PREVENT. SCREEN is the theme for the year 2024.
The theme emphasizes the necessity of educating people with knowledge about minimizing cervical cancer risks and the life-saving importance of regular screenings.

Can green tea cause weight loss? Nutritionists debunk 3 common myths,"Green tea has been marketed as a weight loss solution for the longest time. It is believed that it is much healthier than your regular cup of tea or coffee. But do these claims hold any merit? Recently, Nmami Agarwal, a nutritionist took to Instagram to share 3 common myths about green tea. “While green tea is celebrated for its health benefits, it’s essential to acknowledge that no single beverage holds a monopoly on nutritional superiority,” she wrote in the caption.
1. The more, the better
 How many cups of green tea should you drink? (Source: Freepik)
The common perception is that consuming multiple cups of green tea throughout the day can yield better results for your overall well-being. However, Agarwal pointed out that excess consumption of green tea can upset stomach acid levels and cause hyperacidity.
Sangeeta Tiwari, clinical nutritionist, Artemis Lite, Delhi advises individuals to refrain from consuming large amounts as it can lead to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, and loss of appetite due to presence of caffeine. According to studies, three to five cups of green tea per day is suitable, but the optimal amount may vary from person to person.Advertisement
2. Green tea is caffeine-free
Contrary to popular belief, green tea does contain high caffeine content, which can keep you up till late, said Agarwal. If you’re sensitive to caffeine, Tiwari cautions side effects like anxiety, tremors, irritability and sleeping problems because of the presence of caffeine.
3. Green tea helps in weight loss
According to Agarwal, green tea does not cause weight loss or burn any calories. Concurring, Tiwari said that green tea can contribute to weight loss, but solely relying on drinking green tea without incorporating any workout or dietary changes is not effective.
“Green tea contains caffeine and a specific type of flavonoid called catechin, known for its antioxidant properties. Both have the potential to enhance metabolism. Catechin plays a role in breaking down excess fat, and the combination of catechin and caffeine can elevate the body’s energy expenditure. This increased energy can lead to more active workouts, facilitating the burning of calories and aiding in weight reduction. However, drinking green tea is not a standalone solution for losing kilos,” she cautioned.

So, what are its actual benefits?
Tiwari lists the following:
*Polyphenols in green tea may offer neuroprotective effects, possibly reducing the risk of cognitive decline and supporting memory.
*L-theanine, an amino acid in green tea, has calming effects and may help reduce stress and anxiety.
*Green tea may have a positive impact on cholesterol levels, specifically by lowering LDL cholesterol.
*Green tea may improve insulin sensitivity and help regulate blood sugar levels, contributing to the management and prevention of type 2 diabetes.
*The antioxidants in green tea, particularly catechins, may help reduce inflammation.Advertisement

Top 5 solutions to combat severe hair fall,"Shedding a few strands is as routine as your morning coffee, but when your hair seems to be making a swift exit, it’s time to hit the pause button and investigate. Contrary to the popular belief that your city’s water quality is the sole villain, the truth is a tad more nuanced. There are a combination of factors at play that might be causing hair fall.
Through an Instagram post, Nipun Kapur Sohal, a certified skincare consultant, shared the top 5 things you need to “check, invest and correct” if you’re experiencing severe hair fall.
1. Check your vitamin D3 levels
While the direct impact of vitamin D3 levels on hair quality is not fully understood, deficiency in this vitamin has been associated with hair loss and other hair-related issues. “Vitamin D receptors are present in hair follicles, and adequate levels of vitamin D are believed to be important for maintaining healthy hair follicles. It is also involved in cell growth and differentiation, which are critical processes in hair follicle development and maintenance. Some studies suggest that vitamin D deficiency may be linked to certain types of hair loss, including alopecia areata,” Dr Rishabh Raj Sharma, MD dermatology, senior resident, Noida International Institute of Medical Sciences and Hospital, Noida International University, said.Advertisement
To improve hair growth and overall health, consider including these vitamin-D rich foods in your diet. “Foods rich in vitamin D include non-vegetarian sources, such as fatty fish (such as trout, salmon, tuna, and mackerel), fish, liver, oil, beef, liver, egg yolk, and cheese. Amongst vegetarian sources, mushrooms can also provide variable levels of vitamin D,” Dr Mahima Agarwal, consultant, dermatology, Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, New Delhi, suggested.
But the most natural way for your body to produce vitamin D is through exposure to sunlight. “Spend some time outdoors but be mindful of sun protection to prevent skin damage,” Dr Raj said.
2. Use hair growth serums
Topical therapy such as serums form one of the mainstays of dermatological treatment for different types of hair loss, said Dr Agarwal. “Topical therapy gives an advantage of acting only over the affected areas and prevents the chances of side-effects, thereby making them the most commonly prescribed medicines for a person suffering hair loss.”
However, Dr Raj explained that the effectiveness of these products can vary, and individual responses may differ. “Minoxidil, biotin, finasteride, peptides and redensyl are some common ingredients found in hair growth serums.”Advertisement
Additionally, natural ingredients like pumpkin seed oil, saw palmetto, melatonin extract, caffeine extract and rosemary oil are other topical agents that improve hair growth.

3. Consider using a scalp massager daily
Scalp massagers may contribute to improved hair growth by enhancing blood circulation to the hair follicles. “The increased blood flow delivers more oxygen and nutrients, promoting a healthier scalp environment for optimal hair growth. Additionally, massaging the scalp can help reduce stress and tension, which are known to contribute to hair loss,” Dr Raj said.
It is recommended to use a scalp massager daily or on alternate days, however, it’s essential to be gentle to avoid irritation or damage.
4. Sulphate-free shampoos
Sulphates are a type of detergent commonly used in many shampoos, which are responsible for creating the lathering or foaming effect during washing. “While sulphates effectively remove dirt and oil from the hair and scalp, they can strip the hair of its natural oils, leading to dryness. Sulphates may also irritate the scalp, especially for individuals with sensitive skin or those prone to conditions like eczema or dermatitis,” said Dr Raj.Advertisement
Using sulphate-free shampoos can help mitigate these issues and provide a gentler cleansing experience for the hair and scalp.
5. Add Rosemary oil to your routine
Rosemary oil is believed to offer several benefits for hair health. “Massaging rosemary oil onto the scalp can stimulate blood circulation, thereby promoting hair growth. It may also help inhibit the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone associated with hair loss. Its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antioxidant properties also improve hair quality, texture, and strength,” said Dr Raj.
To use rosemary for your hair, mix a few drops of rosemary oil with a carrier oil (like jojoba or coconut oil) and massage it into the scalp. Before washing it off, let it sit for at least 30 minutes. “You can also add rosemary oil to your regular shampoo and conditioner or combine it with yogurt and honey to create a DIY hair mask,” recommended Dr Raj.

However, it’s crucial to conduct a patch test to look for allergic responses and speak with a dermatologist or medical practitioner, particularly if you have any underlying scalp issues.

6 homemade beverages to lose belly fat,"While no drink can magically melt away belly fat, incorporating certain homemade beverages into a balanced diet and active lifestyle may support your overall weight loss goals. “Homemade drinks can be a supportive element in your quest to reduce belly fat, although they alone won’t guarantee results.,” said Dr Dilip Gude, senior consultant physician, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad.
According to dietitian Shikha Kumari, six homemade drinks are often associated with health benefits and may contribute to fat loss. She took to Instagram to share a post on what they are:
Ginger tea
Contains compounds that may have anti-inflammatory and metabolism-boosting properties. “Ginger tea, with its anti-inflammatory properties, might enhance calorie burning and aid in digestion, potentially reducing belly fat,” said Dr Gude.
Aloe vera juiceAdvertisement
Aloe vera may have digestive benefits, but moderation is key due to its potency, said Kumari.
Cucumber mint water
Hydrating and refreshing, cucumber and mint add flavour to water without added sugars. Dr Gude mentioned, “Cucumber and mint-infused water provide a refreshing, low-calorie hydration option, promoting a feeling of fullness.”
Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) drink
Dilute ACV with water and consume it before meals. According to Kumari, some studies suggest it may help reduce body fat. Dr Gude too agreed and shared, “Apple cider vinegar (ACV), when diluted in water, is believed to reduce appetite and control calorie intake,” mentioned Dr Gude.
Cinnamon tea
Kumari mentioned that cinnamon may help regulate blood sugar levels, potentially reducing cravings.Advertisement

Dr Gude also mentioned that green tea, rich in antioxidants, has catechins that may boost metabolism, potentially aiding in fat loss over time. “Lemon water, known for its low-calorie content and vitamin C, can support digestion and kickstart metabolism, contributing to a healthier stomach,” said Dr Gude.
Dr Gude also stated that while these drinks can be beneficial, they should be part of a comprehensive approach that includes a balanced diet and regular exercise for effective belly fat reduction. “It’s crucial to note that individual responses may vary, and consulting with a healthcare professional before making significant dietary changes is advisable for personalised guidance,” said Dr Gude.

What happens if you have unpolished rice instead of polished one?,"There are so many theories floating around that the consumption of polished rice may not be good for individuals who are watching their weight or trying to lower their blood sugar levels. As such, certified teacher evaluator with the AYUSH Ministry Mayur Karthik took to Instagram to share that tweaking your diet to switch from polished to unpolished rice can be a game-changer.
“Switch from white polished rice to whole rice like brown, black, or red,” said Mayur, who further went on to explain why.
According to Mayur,
*In white polished rice the husk, bran, and seed germ are removed fully through processing, resulting in a reduction or complete depletion of several dietary vitamins, minerals, and fibre leaving just the starchy carbohydrates. “Whereas in the whole rice, everything is intact. Even white rice that hasn’t gone through this extensive processing is good to consume,” said Mayur.Advertisement
*White polished rice has a very high glycemic index, meaning it causes a quicker spike in blood sugar levels, not conducive for people with diabetes.
*The fibre in whole rice, aids in better digestion and maintains a healthy gut.
*The high fibre content in whole rice makes you feel fullness with less. “In contrast, white rice may be less filling, potentially leading to overeating and unwanted weight gain,” said Mayur.

*”Traditionally our forefathers consumed whole rice. It was around the industrial revolution time, rice milling and polishing started as it helped prevent spoilage and extend the storage life of rice helping in better business, mass production and fight food shortage,” said Mayur.Advertisement
He also mentioned that rice with bran and germ can contain “inorganic arnsenic”. “So washing the rice nicely, cooking it with excess water can help remove a major portion of the arsenic content,” said Mayur.
How is unpolished rice different?
Traditionally consumed after polishing or whitening, this process removes the nutrient-rich outer layer, leading to losses in dietary fibre, bioactive compounds, and vitamins. “Additionally, polishing increases the glycemic index due to higher starch content,” said Dr Vikas Jindal, consultant, dept of gastroenterology, CK Birla Hospital, Delhi.
Compared to polished rice, unpolished rice boasts a higher content of fibre, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, said Dr Jindal. “These nutrients play crucial roles in a balanced diet, which requires adequate protein, carbohydrates, fats, and vitamins. For weight management and diabetes control, consuming foods low in calories, fat, and sugar is key. This is where fibre shines,” said Dr Jindal.
According to Dr Jindal, it promotes satiety, lowers cholesterol levels, aids in bowel health, and assists in maintaining a healthy weight. “The fibre and nutrient richness of unpolished rice can enhance satiety, promoting a feeling of fullness and potentially reducing overall calorie intake. This aspect makes it a valuable addition to weight management efforts, providing sustained energy without compromising nutritional value,” explained Dr Rohini Patil, nutritionist, founder, Nutracy Lifestyle.Advertisement
Brown rice boasts a distinct nutritional profile. Unlike polished rice, where calories come primarily from carbohydrates, brown rice derives its calories from protein and contains the fibre-rich husk that increases satiety, preventing overconsumption. “This translates to a steadier release of sugars, potentially preventing blood sugar spikes associated with diabetes. Studies have confirmed these benefits, demonstrating that consuming 150 grams of unpolished rice daily for six weeks led to significant reductions in body weight and waist circumference compared to polished rice consumption,” said Dr Jindal.
What is to be kept in mind?
However, it’s not without its drawbacks. Dr Jindal mentioned that the neutral bran layer contains phytate, which can hinder the absorption of calcium, iron, and zinc, potentially leading to deficiencies. This is something to consider when planning a diet solely on brown rice, said Dr Jindal.

The biggest hurdle towards wider adoption lies in its taste and texture. “The presence of phenolic compounds and fibre in the outer bran layer contributes to a nutty flavour and a firmer texture, often perceived as an astringent.
Additionally, brown rice takes longer to cook.
However, these challenges can be addressed.
Dr Jindal shared, “Pre-soaking for 30 minutes can reduce cooking time and soften the texture.”

Sit a lot? Try the elevated pigeon stretch for relief,"Owing to our sedentary lifestyle, many of us face postural issues that impact our spine and legs. While daily physical activity is a must, not everyone may find as much time. This is where a simple elevated pigeon stretch can help you open up your tightened hamstrings, according to influencer Saloni A. “This is a great hip flexor exercise that helps open up your hip by stretching the front part. Do this exercise with each leg for 10 reps and add it to your stretching routine,” said Saloni.
The pigeon stretch, a prominent yoga pose, is an excellent exercise for enhancing flexibility, particularly in the hip region, concurred fitness expert Garima Goyal.
Steps to perform the pigeon stretch 
*To properly execute the pigeon stretch, begin in a plank position with your hands beneath your shoulders and your body in a straight line.
*Bring one knee forward towards the same-side wrist, positioning it outside the shoulder.
*The shin of this leg is ideally angled diagonally across the body, forming a shape reminiscent of a pigeon’s stance.
*Simultaneously, extend the other leg straight back, keeping it in line with your body.Advertisement
When you use an elevation like a bench, it becomes an elevated pigeon stretch.
How it works
The pigeon stretch engages the muscles and connective tissues around the hips, which can often become tight or tense due to prolonged periods of sitting or other passive activities. “As you ease into the stretch, you may start to feel a deep sensation in the hip of the extended leg, indicating the stretch is targeting the hip flexors,” said Goyal.
Adjusting the angle and position of your front leg can vary the intensity of the stretch.
Goyal listed the points below:
*Experiment with bringing the foot closer to or farther away from the body, finding a position that challenges you without causing pain.Advertisement
*You can also experiment with the angle of the front shin, exploring what feels most effective for your body. Personalising the stretch to your comfort level is crucial for safe and beneficial practice.

Beyond the physical benefits, the pigeon stretch can have a calming effect on the mind. “The focus required to maintain proper form and the controlled breathing associated with yoga can contribute to a sense of mindfulness and relaxation. Incorporating this stretch into a routine can be a valuable practice for both physical and mental well-being,” said Goyal.

What happens to your body if you eat walnuts every morning?,"As the sun rises, casting its golden glow upon a new day, a simple morning ritual could hold the key to unlocking a cascade of health benefits for your body. Enter walnuts, the unassuming yet nutrient-packed nuts that have earned a reputation as a nutritional powerhouse.
Eating walnuts every morning can have several potential effects on your body. From heart health to cognitive function, these tiny kernels offer a myriad of advantages that may surprise you.
According to Dr G Sushma, consultant–clinical dietician, CARE Hospitals, Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, walnuts are a nutrient-dense food rich in omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. Consuming them regularly may contribute to various health benefits. Some potential effects, according to her, include:Advertisement
– Heart health: Walnuts may help lower cholesterol levels, reduce inflammation, and support overall cardiovascular health due to their omega-3 fatty acid content.
– Brain health: Omega-3 fatty acids in walnuts are associated with cognitive function, and some studies suggest that regular consumption may have a positive impact on brain health.
– Promote satiety: Despite being calorie-dense, walnuts may promote feelings of fullness and help control appetite, potentially aiding in weight management.
– Antioxidant support: Walnuts contain antioxidants, such as polyphenols, which may help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals.Advertisement

What are the advantages of including walnuts in your morning diet?
– Rich in omega-3 fatty acids: Walnuts provide a plant-based source of these essential fatty acids.
– Nutrient-dense: They contain various vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.
– Potential heart health benefits: Some studies suggest walnuts may positively impact cholesterol levels and reduce cardiovascular risk.
What are the disadvantages of including walnuts in your morning diet?
– Caloric density: While walnuts offer health benefits, they are calorie-dense, and excessive consumption may lead to weight gain if not accounted for in overall dietary intake. It’s a slippery slope so incorporate them into a balanced diet without exceeding calorie requirements.
– Allergies: People with nut allergies should avoid walnuts and other tree nuts to prevent allergic reactions.
As with any food, moderation and consideration of individual health conditions are key. Consulting with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian can provide personalised advice based on specific health goals and dietary needs, said Dr Sushma.

Art SG in Singapore sees significant sales,"“It was gratifying to see Singaporeans and many others from around the world turn out in force for ART SG. Singapore has truly shown its ability to appeal to many different audiences with its dynamic arts scene. I am truly excited to see how its story unfolds over the years to come,” stated Shuyin Yang, Fair Director of Art SG, adding that she was “thrilled to report a strong second edition”.
While the number of exhibitors stood at 114, more than 25 per cent less than its inaugural edition in 2023, the sales at Art SG were shifter as several works found buyers within hours of the event opening on January 18. “The first day got off to a good start as we sold two works by established European artists to collectors from Southeast Asia, another by Australian artist Jessica Rankin, and had several serious conversations, which converted into sales, allowing for the fair to reach a GBP of 1.5 million,” stated Wendy Xu, General Manager, Asia, White Cube (London, Hong Kong, New York, Seoul, Paris, West Palm Beach). The gallery sold, among others, Turner-Prize winner Tracey Emin’s Move Me (GBP 60,000), Australian artist Jessica Rankin’s Shift the Ocean’s Floor (USD 60,000), and London-based Darren Almond’s Senryū’s (Winter) (GBP 25,000).
One of the eye-catching pieces of the showcase – Netherlands-based artist Marcos Kueh’s larger-than-life vibrant tapestry Woven Billboards: Nenek Moyang – was sold by The Back Room in the range of SGD 50,000 to 100,000 to an institution in Singapore. “As first-time participants in an international art fair, we’re thrilled with the reception that our booth and Platform public installation have received. We got to meet friends old and new, and many of our KL friends even travelled down to support us. The outpouring of support and genuine interest in our artists has been heartening — we hope this will lead to wider exposure for our artists and for Malaysian art in general,” stated Liza Ho, Director of the Kuala Lumpur-based The Back Room.Advertisement

Another significant sale was British abstract painter Ian Davenport’s wall-to-floor installation Lake No.1 (Tide) which was sold by Waddington Custot for $360,000. The London gallery also sold Irish-Welsh sculptor Barry Flanagan’s Elephant with Tusks and Nijinski Hare to a Singapore-based Chinese resident for $680,000, and Switzerland-based artist Yves Dana’s Pierre de Patience for $92,000 to another Singapore-based collector. “Singapore is emerging as a serious place for the modern art collector,” stated Jacob Twyford, Senior Director, Waddington Custot.
Held at Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention Centre, the event had several important institutional representatives and collectors walking its aisles. In attendance, among others, were Sook-Kyung Lee, director of the Whitworth gallery; Haryanto Adikoesoemo, Founder of Museum MACAN, Indonesia; Patrick Son, founder of Sunpride Foundation in Hong Kong; Aaron Cezar, Founding Director of Delfina Foundation in the UK; Zoe Whitley, Director, Chisenhale Gallery in London; as well as collectors Alan Lau from Hong Kong, Alexander Tedja from Indonesia, Kim and Lito Camacho from Singapore, Rudy Tseng from Taiwan, and Rvisra Chirathivat from Thailand. “We’re happy to be back at ART SG to see how the fair is developing. It’s still a young fair but it’s growing in terms of attendance and drawing prominent collectors from Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan. There’s also notably more energy and pace than last year, with clear intent to buy and sales happening more swiftly. We had strong sales during the fair, including works by Anselm Kiefer, Alex Katz, James Rosenquist, Lee Bul, Oliver Beer, Heemin Chung among others, affirming the evolving market here,” stated Dawn Zhu, Director of Asia, Thaddaeus Ropac (London, Paris, Salzburg, Seoul).

The fair also saw the participation of three galleries from India — DAG, Studio Art, and Anant Art. A participant during the inaugural edition of the event in 2023, recalling her experience at the time, Bhavna Kakar, director of Delhi-based Latitude 28 gallery, stated: “Despite a substantial collector base for Indian art in Singapore, substantial sales at Art SG were slow. I did notable sales last year, including one for a significant regional museum. While there was a buzz around the fair, the returns fell short, primarily due to exorbitant freight costs and other logistics. Given the city’s immense wealth and cultural influence, one would expect the collector base to grow over time. Let’s observe, and perhaps in the coming years, it will witness significant expansion, prompting our return.” Challenging established norms in miniatures and contemporary art, her presentation at the fair included works by artists like Gopa Trivedi, Sanket Viramgami, Wardha Shabbir, Waseem Ahmed and Waswo X Waswo.

Affirming that the fair is growing each year, Magnus Renfrew, co-founder, ART SG said: “A significant number of collectors and institutions from the region and further afield attended the fair demonstrating the appeal of both the fair as well as the city’s abundant cultural offerings. Our participating galleries reported swift and robust sales at this buzzy and energetic edition. In addition, we are also proud of the city’s arts scene and how it has embraced ART SG for Singapore Art Week 2024. This year has shown once again that ART SG can both burnish and support Singapore’s increasingly influential role as a hub for the Indo-Pacific’s growing art market and its world-class visual art ecosystems.”",lifestyle
"‘Important to venture out, travel, and personally experience diverse world of food’: Chef Kunal Kapur","A bright smile is one of the first things you notice about chef Kunal Kapur, a Delhi boy at heart and a big-time foodie. The MasterChef India judge, who has a huge social media following, wears many hats — that of a restaurateur, a digital creator, an author, and a food connoisseur.
When we caught up with the chef and his work this National Oatmeal Month, observed every January, he recalled some of his most cherished memories and expressed how he explores the world to keep reinventing himself.
Excerpts:
What is keeping you busy these days?
I am currently occupied with my upcoming cookbook and the management of my restaurants. I also find myself busy in this never-ending cycle of learning, preparing and training. I feel it requires a continuous commitment to research, improve, and enhance your skills as the industry and trends are changing rapidly, so I make it a point to keep up with them and stay current.Advertisement
Can you share a fond memory from your culinary journey?
During the early days of my culinary journey, while I was still training in the kitchen, I recall a memorable moment when I had to prepare a 3-course menu for our chef to taste, for which I had to make a soup for him to taste. To my surprise, the chef, in a moment of frustration, flung the soup plate across the kitchen and shouted at me for not including a spoon.
It felt like the most embarrassing moment of my career back then, and I thought the chef had overreacted. However, over the years, I’ve realised that he intended to teach me a valuable lesson. It was not just about mastering the art of cooking; it was not only important to be mindful of the presentation but also of how the dish was served. This incident has now become one of my fondest memories, and I now live by the lesson he taught me.
What do you think is the role of spices in the Indian culinary space?Advertisement
In India, our love and affection for spices are profound, as they infuse our recipes with so many wonderful flavours. I would say spices are the heart and soul of our dishes; they represent the rich culinary heritage we own in our country. For instance, the aromatic notes of garam masala in the North, the coconut-infused spices in the South and the mustard-based blends in the East—all these regional nuances contribute to the incredible diversity and excitement of our Indian cuisine.
The role of spices in the Indian culinary space goes beyond mere seasoning; it is a cultural expression and a celebration of our rich diversity. It’s also a key element that makes Indian cuisine a globally cherished and distinctive culinary tradition.
How important is exploring a new place through its food?
Every dish in India has a story to tell, it is like taking an adventure through exploring its food that goes beyond taste. Food serves as a gateway to the heart of any community, reflecting its history, traditions, and the unique stories of its people. As a chef, this culinary exploration is a fundamental part of my journey, offering insights into diverse culinary techniques, ingredient combinations, and the cultural significance attached to each dish.Advertisement
I had learned Galouti and Katori kebab from chefs in the hotel, but travelling to Lucknow and spending time with the local restaurants there gave me an in-depth understanding of the art of kebab and curries. My time spent with street vendors, working and observing them was laughed upon by my colleagues. However, I wanted to learn from people who cook daily as that was the best way to grasp culinary knowledge. So having worked at local eateries, working at weddings to see large-scale cooking, and learning from home cooks have been such a memorable adventure.
What are some of the biggest challenges as a chef that no one talks about and how do you overcome them?
Having trained as a culinary professional comes with its own set of challenges and barriers. The barrier is that what one has learned from the textbook pretty much becomes the norm for us chefs. However, my perspective changed ever since I began travelling extensively, exploring culinary landscapes across India and around the world. This exposure has opened my eyes to the endless food possibilities that are out there, far beyond what was captured in the textbooks I was learning.

In my opinion, it’s not that the curriculum was incorrect; it was merely limited. No set of books can capture the entirety of culinary knowledge. I think it is important to venture out, travel, and personally experience the diverse world of food.

In your opinion, how have oats become a breakfast staple nowadays?Advertisement
Oats have gained immense popularity for their health benefits as they are a rich source of proteins and nutrients. As chefs, it’s our responsibility to not only provide nutritious options but also make them exciting and flavourful. I like to think of oats beyond the traditional oatmeal. While oatmeal is a classic, there are many ways to innovate and elevate the breakfast experience.
For instance, we can incorporate oats into pancakes, waffles, and even smoothies to add a nutritional boost without compromising on taste. Additionally, savoury oat-based dishes can also be a game-changer, where oats idli and oats upma are a few more satisfying breakfast options. When it comes to oats and exploring their versatility, my favourite everyday recipe would be a unique spinach and oats pancake – a perfect way to start my day.

5 types of apology languages to solve relationship conflicts,"In the realm of relationships, the concept of love languages, popularised by Gary Chapman, has become a guiding light for many seeking to express heartfelt commitment. What may surprise some is that this idea extends beyond love to the realm of apologies. Jennifer Thomas, collaborating with Chapman, delves into this intriguing territory in their book, “The 5 Apology Languages: The Secret to Healthy Relationships,” uncovering the diverse ways individuals seek and offer apologies.
Understanding the apology language of a loved one can help them feel truly validated and heard. According to Sidhharrth S Kumaar, relationship coach, NumroVani , identifying and speaking the apology language of your partner can lead to a deeper bond, fostering healthier relationships.  So, without further ado, let us present to you the 5 apology languages.
1. Expressing regret
Some people value a straightforward acknowledgment of wrongdoing. In such a scenario, Kumaar told indianexpress.com in an interaction that a simple “I’m sorry” can carry profound meaning for individuals who value this form of expression. “It’s critical to apologise truly and without reservation for the hurt you caused, without offering an explanation or an attempt to defend your conduct.”Advertisement
2. Accepting responsibility
The second language involves earnestly admitting wrongdoing and taking accountability for one’s actions. “In this type of apology, one acknowledges their mistakes and takes ownership of their behaviour. Expressions such as “It was my fault,” “I shouldn’t have done that,” and “I’ll make sure it doesn’t happen again” have a profound influence,” Kumaar said. Adding to this, taking responsibility means not only saying sorry but also acknowledging the impact of one’s behaviour on the other person.
3. Making restitution
Taking proactive steps to make things right is the main idea of this language. “This apology language emphasises the importance of tangible efforts to repair the damage. From small gestures to significant acts, the emphasis is on restoring trust through concrete actions. This could be buying a gift, finishing work they forgot to complete, or offering assistance with a particular activity,” Kumaar explained.
4. Promising change
This language centers on demonstrating a commitment to change. “Individuals who appreciate his apology language look for signs that the apology is not just lip service but a genuine promise to avoid repeating the hurtful behaviour,” Kumaar said.
5. Requesting forgiveness
For some, the act of seeking forgiveness is crucial. “Asking the person who was offended to pardon the error is the goal of this language. It respects the person’s sentiments and decision-making while granting them authority. “Can you forgive me?” and “I hope you can understand my mistake” are examples of phrases that express regret and a wish to make amends,” Kumaar noted.

Gogi Saroj Pal (1945-2024): Artist who explored the feminine force through colours,"One of the several lanes in Delhi’s East of Kailash led into a basement studio that was always open for young artists. Filled with the chatter of freewheeling conversations, for artist couple Gogi Saroj Pal and Ved Nayar this was their way of extending support to young artists. “Young artists often find it difficult to afford a studio,” stated Pal in an interview to The Indian Express in 2014. Known to have supported several artists in different ways possible and also exploring the feminine force through her works, Pal passed away in Delhi on January 27. She was 79.
“To me, she was Gogi amma. Always encouraging young artists, she would give them an honest opinion,” recalled artist Kanchan Chander, who worked at Garhi Artist Studios in Delhi at the same time as Pal in the ’80s.
Born in 1945 in Neoli in Uttar Pradesh, the postgraduate from College of Art in Delhi, who worked in a variety of mediums, was constantly questioning gender bias and stereotypes through her oeuvre, with an intention of both depicting unequal realities and also empowering women. Exhibiting strength, her protagonists were often inspired by myths and fables, from ‘Kinnari’, the mythical bird-woman, to ‘Kamdhenu’, the wish-fulfilling cow. Her voluptuous ‘nayikas’ were sensual and brazen.Advertisement
Sharing her own struggles of pursuing a career in art, in an interview to The Indian Express in 2011, she had stated: “When I informed my father that I wanted to pursue art, he wrote back saying that I’m responsible for my own decision and have to prove it right… I haven’t fared bad… I never wanted to adhere to rules.”
Recalling the initial years of her career, the 1990 Lalit Kala Akademi National Award winner had added, “The initial few years were difficult. Several galleries backed out after agreeing to show my work.”
Bewailing her untimely demise, the National Gallery of Modern Art posted: “One of the pioneering feminist voices in Indian art, she went beyond the conventions of picture making, often interweaving fantasy and reality to delve into the societal reality of womanhood within which they navigate. Moreover, her expressions were not confined to flat canvas but found an equally powerful home in diverse mediums. Gogi Saroj Pal’s ineffable vision shall endure as a radiant milestone in the annals of Indian art.”
Credited with over 30 solo exhibitions, some of her acclaimed series include “Young Monks”, inspired by the solitary life of monks, and “Aag ka Dariya”that highlighted the rampant practice of female foeticide. She responded to the 2012 Delhi gang-rape case with a series dedicated to Nirbhaya, depicting an angry woman with sickles. “Her works were beautiful and portrayed strong women, but she was stronger,” notes Chander. She adds how Pal was actively working till the last days, fulfilling the endeavour that she often expressed: “I wanted to give Indian mythology some new ‘nayikas’ to introspect.”",lifestyle

Simple exercises that make climbing stairs easier,"Owing to our sedentary lifestyle, many of us struggle with doing basic activities like climbing a flight of stairs. Instead of getting worked up, it is time to gradually strength train to ace such activities. Experts urge that the key lies in incorporating simple exercises into your routine.
Nupuur Patil, nutritionist, Nupuur Patil Fitness shared the following training pattern:
Cardiovascular conditioning: Engage in aerobic exercises like brisk walking, and jogging. This enhances cardiovascular fitness, strengthens leg muscles, and improves overall stamina, ensuring you can climb stairs without fatigue.Advertisement
Leg strength training: Focus on leg-centric exercises such as squats, lunges, and leg presses. “Building strength in quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves promotes stability and power, making stair climbing more effortless,” said Patil.
Balance and stability exercises: Include exercises that enhance balance and stability, like single-leg stands or stability ball exercises. Improved balance reduces the risk of tripping or stumbling on stairs.
 Weight training is a must (Source: Pixabay)
Flexibility training: Incorporate stretching exercises to improve flexibility in the hips, knees, and ankles. Enhanced flexibility aids in a wider range of motion, making stair climbing more comfortable and reducing strain on joints.
Functional movement training: Mimic stair climbing movements with exercises like step-ups, or box jumps. This functional approach targets specific muscle groups involved in stair ascent, promoting muscle memory and coordination.Advertisement
Some exercises that can help
“These exercises target various muscle groups, enhancing strength, stability, and flexibility,” said fitness expert Garima Goyal.
1. Chair squats 
Chair squats are an effective lower body exercise.
*Begin by standing in front of a chair with your feet shoulder-width apart.
*Lower your body towards the chair as if you were about to sit down, keeping your weight on your heels.
*Ensure your knees don’t go past your toes.
*Return to the standing position, engaging your quadriceps and glutes. This exercise strengthens your thighs and buttocks, crucial for stair climbing.
2. Side leg lifts 
Targeting the outer thighs and hips, side leg lifts improve hip stability.
*Start by standing next to a chair for support.
*Lift one leg sideways while keeping it straight, then slowly lower it back down. Repeat on the other leg.
This exercise strengthens the muscles essential for lateral movements, enhancing overall leg function.
3. Chair Plank Advertisement
Chair planks focus on core strength, which is vital for balance and stability during stair climbing.
*Sit on the edge of a chair and place your hands on the seat, fingers pointing forward.
*Walk your feet forward until your body forms a straight line from head to heels.
*Hold the position, engaging your core muscles.
“This exercise strengthens your core, aiding in maintaining an upright posture while climbing stairs,” said Goyal.

*Hold for as long as you can to strengthen your quadriceps and glutes.
5. Step-Ups
*Utilise a sturdy step or platform.
*Step up with one foot, bringing the opposite knee towards your chest. Step back down and switch legs.

What happens if you have pickled ginger post meals?,"Many people experience bloating post meals owing to eating too fast or having too much fibre in the meal. While prevention is always better, an age-old remedy that diet expert Simrat Kathuria swears by to deal with bloating is pickled ginger which can be made at home.
“This adrak ka achaar is super easy and quick. It is the perfect buddy to your food and is loaded with health benefits,” said Kathuria.
How to make pickled ginger?
Recipe
*Peel and julienne ginger.
*In a jar, add ginger, black salt, green chillies, and lemon juice.
*Shake the jar vigorously.
*Let the pickle rest.
When is it ready?Advertisement
When the ginger is a little pink, it means the pickle is ready to eat, said Kathuria, adding, that it is perfect to consume this achaar during the winter.
Kathuria mentioned the following benefits of ginger 
*Ginger roots contain ingredients like Aryl alkanes that improve the appetite and enhance nutrient absorption
*Ginger has compounds that can reduce inflammation in the digestive tract, potentially alleviating bloating.
*Ginger promotes the production of digestive enzymes, helping to break down food and prevent gas buildup.Advertisement
*It may help relax the muscles of the digestive system, reducing spasms and easing bloating.
How does the pickled ginger help?
Pickled ginger, like many pickled vegetables, is a low pH food that is high in good microbes, particularly, lactobacillus bacteria, which is recognised as a primary probiotic.
Sarika Kumari, dietician, HCL Healthcare shared the benefits:
*Eating pickled ginger every day alleviates symptoms of cold, cough, flu, joint pain, and indigestion.
*Contains bioactive compounds, such as gingerol, shogaols, and zingiberene which demonstrate anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties thereby helping to reduce inflammation in the body and boost immunity.
*Used as a palate cleanser to refresh the tastebuds.Advertisement
*It is low in calories, making it flavourful and a health-conscious addition to the meals.
How much to have?
• We can have 3-4 gm (1 teaspoon) per day, said Sarika
What happens if you have it every day?
It improves immunity and gut health, said Sarika.
However, one must consume it cautiously as eating it regularly may trigger the following symptoms in some individuals:Advertisement
*Due to its high sodium content, it can affect high blood pressure and can be a risk factor for heart disease, said Sarika. Concurred Dr G Krishna Mohan Reddy, consultant physician and diabetologist, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad, and shared that pickled ginger may contain a significant amount of salt due to the pickling process. “High sodium intake can be detrimental to individuals with hypertension or those monitoring their salt intake,” said Dr Reddy.

*Due to the acidic and spicy nature of this condiment, it may trigger acidity, bloating, and upset stomach, mentioned Sarika. Dr Reddy also noted that the acidity and chewy texture of pickled ginger may have implications for dental health. “Rinsing the mouth with water or consuming it in moderation can help minimise potential effects on tooth enamel,” said Dr Reddy. 
Another aspect to consider is people with allergies or sensitivities to ginger or other ingredients in pickled ginger should avoid it to prevent adverse reactions, added Dr Reddy. 
Some individuals may not enjoy the taste or find pickled ginger too strong. “Personal preferences play a role in whether someone will benefit from or be averse to consuming pickled ginger,” said Dr Reddy. Advertisement

Is ‘skinification’ what you need to maintain healthy hair?,"Let’s face it — our hair often takes a back seat to the meticulous care we lavish on our skin. However, a recent beauty trend making waves, which involves treating your hair the same way you treat your skin, is being touted as a game-changer. Termed as “skinification,” individuals practicing this trend are realising the importance of extending skincare principles to their tresses.
So, what exactly is skinification of hair?
In simple terms, the skinification of hair revolves around erasing the boundaries between skin and hair care by treating both of them equally, said Dr Monica Bambroo, head of dermatology and cosmetology at Artemis Hospital, Gurgaon.
“Skinification of hair is all about going beyond the conventional practices of sticking to just shampoo, conditioner, and hair mask, and doing a lot more to have healthy hair. As per this concept, hair and scalp need to be treated as an extension of the skin,” she added.Advertisement
In this practice, the emphasis is on keeping a healthy scalp as the foundation for good hair. “Skincare products, such as serums and masks, are tailored for use on the hair and scalp to address specific needs like hydration, exfoliation, and environmental stressor protection,” said Dr DM Mahajan, senior consultant in dermatology at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, Delhi.
Why is this trend gaining popularity?
According to Dr Seema Oberoi Lall, consultant in dermatology at CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram, the surge in popularity can be attributed to the influence of social media platforms. “In an age where YouTube tutorials offer a treasure trove of transformative hair rituals and selfies flood our feeds, individuals are increasingly drawn to experimenting with their locks.”
The boom of skinification also stems from a desire to have a more personalised and holistic approach to hair care. “As people prioritise self-care and well-being, expanding skincare ideas to hair care is a logical step. The availability of novel hair care products inspired by skincare formulations adds to the trend, providing remedies for specific hair and scalp conditions. Overall, customers demand a more comprehensive approach to hair care that goes beyond standard shampoo and conditioning routines,” said Dr Mahajan.
Here are the steps you can follow to incorporate skinification into your hair care routine:
 Would you try this trend? (Source: Freepik)
Scalp analysis: Begin by assessing your scalp’s specific needs. Identify concerns such as dryness, oiliness, dandruff, or irritation.
Gentle cleansing: Use a sulfate-free and gentle shampoo to cleanse your scalp and hair. Avoid harsh chemicals that can strip the scalp of natural oils.
Exfoliation: Integrate an exfoliating scalp treatment to remove dead skin cells and promote a healthier scalp environment. This step can help with issues like dandruff.
Serums and treatments: Apply hair serums or treatments with ingredients tailored to address your specific scalp and hair concerns. Look for products containing ingredients like hyaluronic acid for hydration or antioxidants for protection.
Massage: Incorporate scalp massages into your routine to stimulate blood circulation and promote nutrient absorption. This can be done with your fingertips or specialised scalp massage tools.
Hydration: Use hydrating masks or deep-conditioning treatments to nourish both the scalp and hair. Ingredients like argan oil, aloe vera, or shea butter can provide moisture and improve overall hair texture.
Sun protection: Protect your scalp and hair from the sun’s harmful UV rays by using hair products with built-in sun protection or wearing a hat when exposed to direct sunlight.
Balanced diet: Support scalp health from within by maintaining a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals essential for hair growth. Include foods with biotin, vitamin E, and omega-3 fatty acids.
Regular trims: Schedule regular hair trims to prevent split ends and maintain overall hair health. This supports the skinification approach by promoting strong and vibrant hair.
Consultation with professionals: If you have specific concerns or conditions, consult with a dermatologist or trichologist for personalised advice and treatment options.Advertisement
Which skincare ingredients can you add to your hair care?
Dr Mahajan lists the following:

Hyaluronic acid, known for its moisturising properties, can alleviate dryness and maintain a balanced moisture level.
Salicylic acid helps exfoliate the scalp, removing dead skin cells.
Argan oil or vitamin E, rich in antioxidants, serves as a protective barrier against environmental aggressors.
Aloe vera gel is recognised for its soothing and moisturising characteristics.
Vitamin C hair serums promote collagen formation.
Shampoos containing niacinamide (vitamin B3) help thicken hair and heal the scalp, preventing hair thinning and scalp sensitivity.
Peptide-infused hair masks provide nourishment and repair, boosting hair vitality.
Sunscreen is an essential component for protecting hair from UV radiation.
Gentle micellar water cleansers and retinol-infused hair products help stimulate cell turnover.

Find out the best time for dinner,"Before we dive into answering the question of what is the best time for dinner, it is pertinent to understand some of the dinner mistakes that we may be making and how we can find a middle ground to ensure we eat on time.
According to nutritionist Leema Mahajan, the top dinner mistakes are:
*No snacking after dinner
*Do not hit the bed right after dinner
*Avoiding carbs at dinner for weight loss – People usually avoid carbohydrates in the evening by thinking that they can cause fat gain.Advertisement
“The only thing it does is, it reduces the total calories consumed in the day and it wouldn’t matter if that calorie deficit is to come from skipping lunch or dinner or eating in lower quantities across meals in the day,” said Mahajan.
 What is the optimum time for dinner? (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)
*Skipping dinner for weight loss – According to Mahajan, there is no such evidence suggesting the metabolic benefit of skipping dinner. As long as carbohydrates fit into your plan and are taken in a quantified manner, there is no need to worry about fat gain.
Now, coming to the question asked, Mahajan said that it is ideal to have dinner three hours before bedtime. “Ideally, the best time to have dinner is 2-3 hours before going to bed, primarily to prevent the occurrence of gastric reflux—a condition where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing discomfort and potential health issues,” explained Dt Rashi Tantia, HOD- dietician, Metro Hospital, Faridabad.
In most cultures, people tend to follow a sleep schedule that falls between 10-11 pm. Given this, it is recommended that dinner time should ideally be around 6-8 pm. “This timing aligns with the body’s natural rhythms and allows for sufficient time for digestion before bedtime. Understanding the process of digestion sheds light on why this timing is significant,” said Dr Tantia.Advertisement
Food undergoes a complex journey in our digestive system, starting from the moment it enters our mouths until it reaches the stomach and eventually gets absorbed in the small intestine. According to Dr Tantia, the entire process takes approximately 1.5-2 hours for proper digestion to occur. This includes breaking down complex food components into simpler forms that the body can absorb and utilise.

“Consuming a meal 2-3 hours before sleep provides the digestive system with the necessary time to carry out its functions effectively. When we eat close to bedtime, the body may not have enough time to complete the digestion process, potentially leading to indigestion, discomfort, or disrupted sleep,” said Dr Tantia.
Moreover, incomplete digestion may hinder the proper absorption of nutrients from the food we consume. Additionally, eating well before bedtime can contribute to a more restful sleep, as the body is not preoccupied with the demanding task of digesting a substantial meal.
Furthermore, adhering to a 2-3 hour gap between dinner and sleep helps in managing the release of gastric juices. “These digestive fluids play a crucial role in breaking down food, and having adequate time between eating and lying down allows the stomach to maintain a more stable and controlled environment for this process,” said Dr Tantia.

What happens if you gently press this point on your leg?,"Most times, social media offers some unique solutions addressing many of our day-to-day concerns like dehydration, stomach issues, or even sleep. But they need to be taken with a pinch of salt. As such, when we came across a post from content creator Alan Mandell, suggesting that it is possible to press a specific point on the leg to induce sleep, we decided to turn toward our in-house experts.
According to Mandell, pressing a point called SP6, located inside of the leg, four finger-widths above the ankle, just behind the tibia bone, can help with sleep and tackling menstrual cramps.
Dr Rohini Patil, nutritionist, and founder, Nutracy Lifestyle said that acupressure on specific points, such as SP6 is believed by some to have potential benefits for sleep and menstrual cramps. “By stimulating this point, it is believed to induce a state of relaxation, potentially reducing the time it takes to fall asleep. The pressure applied to SP6 may help regulate the body’s energy flow, addressing factors that contribute to sleep disturbances,” said Mandell.Advertisement
Some proponents suggest that incorporating SP6 acupressure into a daily routine may lead to improved sleep quality over time.
Applying gentle but firm pressure to SP6 for about one minute and holding it for an additional two minutes is believed to help regulate the flow of energy and blood in the pelvic area, said Dr Patil. “While acupressure is considered a holistic approach, it is essential to recognise that scientific evidence supporting its efficacy is still evolving,” said Dr Patil.
Additionally, according to Dr Patil, it may offer relief from premenstrual syndrome and anxiety. “SP6 acupressure is often explored as a natural remedy for alleviating menstrual cramps,” said Dr Patil, underlining that more scientific study is needed.

Acknowledging that there is “anecdotal evidence” that acupressure via multiple pressure points can help in sleep disorders, Dr Dilip Gude, senior consultant physician, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad said that although large-scale randomised control studies are required for confirming this association in some patients, this stimulation of pressure points (multiple rather than single) may help in insomnia. “There can be a placebo/bias effect as well for sleep disorders,” said Dr Gude.

Are you forgetful? Here are 5 superfoods to add to your diet for boosting memory power,"In our fast-paced world, maintaining optimal cognitive function is crucial for navigating daily challenges. Memory power, a key aspect of cognitive health, can be enhanced through various lifestyle choices, including a nutrient-rich diet.
According to Ekta Singhwal, dietician, Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, superfoods are believed to be important for boosting memory power due to their rich content of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that support brain health. “These nutrients contribute to better cognitive function and may protect against age-related cognitive decline,” she tells indianexpress.com in an interaction.
Listed below are the five superfoods that are important for boosting brain health and memory power.Advertisement

Blueberries: The Brain Berry

Blueberries are often referred to as the “brain berry” due to their rich content of antioxidants called flavonoids. These compounds have been linked to improved memory and cognitive function. Research suggests that regular consumption of blueberries may help delay age-related cognitive decline, making them an excellent addition to your diet for a memory boost.

Fatty Fish: Omega-3 Powerhouse

Fatty fish such as salmon, trout, and sardines are abundant sources of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Omega-3s are crucial for brain health, and DHA, in particular, is a major structural component of the brain. Including fatty fish in your diet can support cognitive function, enhance memory, and potentially reduce the risk of age-related cognitive decline.

Broccoli: Brain-Boosting Cruciferous Green

Broccoli is not only a nutritional powerhouse for the body but also for the brain. Rich in antioxidants and vitamin K, broccoli supports healthy brain function and may contribute to better memory retention.
 Additionally, its high levels of compounds called glucosinolates have been linked to the prevention of cognitive decline.(Source: Freepik)

Dark Chocolate: A Sweet Memory Treat

Good news for chocolate lovers – dark chocolate contains flavonoids, caffeine, and antioxidants, making it a delectable treat for your brain. The antioxidants in dark chocolate, known as cocoa flavonoids, have been linked to improved memory and cognitive function. Opt for dark chocolate with at least 70% cocoa content for maximum benefits.Advertisement

Turmeric: The Golden Spice for Memory

Curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, has powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Research suggests that curcumin can cross the blood-brain barrier and has the potential to clear accumulations of plaques associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Including turmeric in your diet or taking a curcumin supplement may contribute to improved memory and overall brain health.
Remember, a balanced and varied diet, coupled with regular exercise and sufficient sleep, forms the foundation for a healthy mind.",lifestyle

Pomegranate peel is believed to have potential benefits for relieving cough due to its rich content of antioxidants, primarily tannins, and flavonoids. According to Dr Ranga Santosh Kumar, consultant general physician, and diabetologist, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad, these compounds have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that may contribute to “soothing irritation in the throat and respiratory tract, offering relief from cough symptoms”.
However, it’s essential to note that scientific research specifically addressing the efficacy of pomegranate peel for cough relief is limited, stressed Dr Kumar. “While some traditional medicine practices incorporate pomegranate peel for respiratory benefits, more comprehensive studies are needed to establish its effectiveness conclusively.”

Individual responses to natural remedies can vary, and it’s crucial to approach them with an understanding that they may not substitute professional medical advice or prescribed cough medications.Advertisement

Dr Kumar asserted that if cough symptoms persist or worsen, consulting with a healthcare professional is advisable for a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment. “Pregnant or breastfeeding individuals and those with underlying health conditions should exercise caution and seek guidance from a healthcare provider before incorporating pomegranate peel or any home remedy into their routine.”

Getting married in the winter? Here are some ways to prep your skin for it,"Every bride dreams of looking her absolute best on her wedding day, but the harsh winters can leave your skin feeling extra dry and flaky. Winter brings some challenges to the skin.
The cold winter air lacks the moisture content of the warmer months, leading to a common skin health concern, dryness. This dryness isn’t limited to the top layer; it penetrates deep into the skin and upsets the natural balance, leaving the skin dull and flaky. The skin struggles to retain moisture, so it’s important to change up your skincare routine for added hydration and protection.
Dr Niti Gaur, dermatologist and founder of Citrine Clinic, Gurgaon, recommended staying away from smoking and alcohol, as these go a long way in ensuring that your skin remains healthy and radiant.Advertisement
“A glowing, healthy skin cannot be achieved overnight, so brides need to take extra care of their skin at least six months before the wedding,” Dr Gaur said.
To preserve your skin health and boost your natural glow, here are some winter skincare tips for all brides-to-be.
1. Hydration: The air in winter months is dry, which can leave your skin dehydrated. So using a high-quality, hydrating moisturiser that suits your skin type, is a must. Ingredients like hyaluronic acid can help lock in moisture, making your skin plump and smooth.
2. Cleansing: Avoid harsh cleansers that strip natural oils from your skin. Instead opt for gentle, hydrating cleansers that preserve your skin’s natural barrier, preventing dryness and irritation.Advertisement
3. Exfoliation: Regular, gentle exfoliation is crucial to remove dead skin cells, promoting a bright and even complexion. However, be cautious not to over-exfoliate, as it can lead to skin sensitivity and redness. Avoid long hot showers, as they strip the skin of its natural moisturising oils.
4. Nutrition for Skin: A diet rich in antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamins can significantly impact the health and appearance of your skin. Consider taking supplements that will help you complete your nutrition intake. Foods like berries, nuts, and green leafy vegetables are also great choices.

5. Stay Hydrated: Drinking plenty of water is essential for maintaining skin hydration from the inside out. It helps flush out toxins and keeps your skin cells plump.
6. Sun Protection: Even in ice, UV rays can be harmful. Apply broad-spectrum sunscreen each day to defend your pores and skin from untimely ageing and hold even pores and skin tone.Advertisement
7. Stress Management: Wedding planning may be worrying, which may affect your skin. Practices like yoga, meditation, or even an ordinary workout can assist in manipulating stress levels.
8. Consistent Routine: Lastly, consistency is important. Maintain an everyday skincare routine, giving your pores and skin adequate time to adapt and monitor their glow.
It is important to consult a dermatologist so that a personalised skincare routine can be formulated, and any additional concerns like acne, pigmentation etc can be addressed.",lifestyle
Is being friends with your ex ever a good idea?,"The end of a romantic relationship often marks a complex intersection of emotions, leaving many wondering about the feasibility and wisdom of remaining friends with an ex-partner.
While societal norms and individual experiences may vary, the question of whether being friends with an ex is okay has sparked widespread debate and contemplation.
Ambika Chawla, lead clinical psychologist, Lissun, explained that there are certain situations where one can remain friends with their ex.Advertisement

When longtime friends have converted their friendship into a romantic relationship are seen to step backwards into friendship, when the relationship doesn’t flourish.
When neither of the partners has invested emotionally, they are easily able to transform the relationship into the spectrums of friendship.

Mostly, Chawla noted that individuals come to her (psychologists) with the struggle of forgetting their exes or the relationship itself, especially when they are still in the grieving process of losing the relationship or the person from their lives.
“‘To forget’ the whole time becomes their agenda, and that’s because it interferes with the pleasant memories they had created.  The incongruence of what and how they imagined their future life to be and how it turned out actually gives immense discomfort, and this leaves the ex as a villain. Many individuals develop excessive animosity towards their ex-partners and blame them for the devastating state they are in then. This leaves no scope for them to be friends afterwards,” Chawla explained in an interaction with indianexpress.com. 
 Any situations creating a private space with your ex must be avoided to provide unsaid security and assurance to any new partner you or your ex might have. (Source: Freepik)
What are some ground rules to follow in case you’re friends with an ex?
According to Chawla, these are some ground rules in case you still want to pursue a friendship with an ex.
1. Avoid comparison – You must be careful to never compare your old and new relationship/partner at any ground. The relationship formed with any individual will hold its uniqueness and that must be given due dilligence.Advertisement
2. Avoid private meetings – Any situations creating a private space with your ex must be avoided to provide unsaid security and assurance to any new partner you or your ex might have.
3. Avoid discussing new relationships – For exes to have a healthy friendship, they must avoid discussing their new relationships with each other, as it may take them back in time promoting passive comparison.
4. Avoid discussing your old relationship with them – There could be an unrest in any of the exes with respect to old relationship and they may bring up the dissatisfaction in passive aggressive forms. This will hamper the friendship they are willing to sustain.",lifestyle

How to build a secure foundation for lasting relationships,"In a world where relationships can be as complex as they are rewarding, establishing a secure foundation is paramount. Whether you’re starting a new relationship or looking to strengthen an existing one, certain principles remain universal. Recently, Sadaf Siddiqi, a psychotherapist, shared valuable insights on Instagram, explaining the top 5 ways to create a secure relationship.
“If you’re struggling in a romantic relationship, reflect on where you and your partner are in these areas,” she wrote in the caption.
1. Holding yourself and your partner accountable
According to Siddiqi, accountability is key. Apologising for mistakes and making an effort to be reliable and consistent are ways to hold oneself accountable. On the other hand, holding your partner accountable involves not ignoring red flags and being direct when their words and actions don’t align.Advertisement
2. Managing conflict instead of avoiding it
Avoiding conflict can manifest as “giving the silent treatment, not expressing your needs or ‘walking on eggshells’ (being careful to not offend or upset someone),” warns Siddiqi. To manage conflicts effectively, she suggests setting boundaries, listening to understand, and separating the person from the problem.
3. Getting comfortable being alone or close
Siddiqi emphasises that healthy independence in a relationship stems from developing a strong sense of identity outside of the partnership. Finding fulfillment not only from relationship goals but also personal goals is essential for a well-rounded connection.
4. Respecting your needs as much as your partner’s
In secure relationships, Siddiqi advises setting and honouring boundaries between both partners. “This can look like expressing what is not okay with you and also accepting when your partner says ‘no’ to you.”

5. Actively regulating your emotions daily
Siddiqi urges that in secure relationships, each person is responsible for their own reactions. This involves asking for space when triggered, learning how to self-soothe, and being vulnerable.

Adding to this, Sidhharrth S Kumaar, relationship coach, NumroVani told indianexpress.com that the beginning of securing a relationship starts with knowing your partner and yourself. “Self-awareness about your own likes and dislikes, understanding your partner’s love language, and thought patterns can give an edge in relationships.”Advertisement
Kumaar further advises on curating your love language, transparent and authentic communication, and expressing gratitude, which are crucial elements for building a strong and secure relationship. “By developing and expressing your love language, you allow for deeper, more meaningful, and customised displays of affection in your partnership. Being open and honest in sharing your needs and ideas helps build trust and rapport. And showing your partner how much you value them through your words and deeds makes your relationship stronger.“",lifestyle
India to start world’s first black tiger safari in Odisha; know all about it,"The Odisha government, led by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, has announced the establishment of a melanistic tiger safari – a groundbreaking initiative that will be the first of its kind globally.
The safari is set to be located near Baripada in the Mayurbhanj district of the state, as per the official announcement made by Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik on X, previously known as Twitter.
Covering an expansive 200-hectare area adjacent to National Highway 18, the chosen site is approximately 15 km away from the Similipal Tiger Reserve, featuring a similar landscape. Notably, Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR) stands as the sole habitat for melanistic tigers worldwide, as per the last All India Tiger Estimation Report released by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in 2018.

Glad to announce that #Odisha is setting up an exclusive Melanistic Tiger Safari near Similipal Tiger Reserve in #Mayurbhanj. Tourists and visitors can now have a glimpse of the rare and majestic species found only in Odisha. pic.twitter.com/h3g2ep8tui
— Naveen Patnaik (@Naveen_Odisha) January 24, 2024
The 2022 All India Tiger Estimation revealed that out of the 16 tigers recorded in Similipal, 10 displayed melanistic characteristics. This reserve initially reported the presence of melanistic tigers in 2007.Advertisement
This move aims to provide tourists and visitors with a unique opportunity to witness the rare and majestic species found exclusively in Odisha.
Around a couple of years ago, researchers, including scientists from the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) in Bengaluru, identified a single gene mutation responsible for black stripes and a distinctive pattern in these tigers. The mutation in the gene Transmembrane Aminopeptidase Q (Taqpep) led to the broadening and spreading of black stripes against a tawny background, creating a pattern known as pseudo-melanism.
 The Forest Department emphasised that the safari is poised to elevate wildlife tourism in Odisha, anticipating a significant influx of visitors and establishing itself as an added attraction for those exploring the Similipal Tiger Reserve. (Source: X/ Naveen Patnaik)
Pseudo-melanism differs from true melanism, characterised by an unusually high deposition of melanin, a dark pigment. The study also highlighted that the melanistic tigers in Similipal may have originated from a small founding population, leading to inbreeding.
The upcoming melanistic tiger safari is expected to house surplus tigers from Nandankanan Zoo and rescued/orphaned tigers unfit for the wild but suitable for display. The open enclosure will cover about 100 hectares for display purposes, while the remaining area will be utilised for veterinary care facilities, a rescue center, staff infrastructure, and visitor amenities, according to Principal Chief Conservator of Forests Susanta Nanda.Advertisement

Don’t drink milk? This is how you can fulfill your calcium needs,"For many, the idea of obtaining sufficient calcium without the customary glass of milk may seem like a dietary puzzle. Whether driven by lactose intolerance, ethical choices, or personal preferences, the quest for calcium-rich alternatives has become more prevalent than ever. Fear not, as we embark on a journey beyond the dairy aisle, unveiling a palette of nutritious alternatives that not only cater to the calcium needs of non-dairy drinkers but also add a flavourful twist to their dietary repertoire.
But first, let’s understand why calcium is important for our bodies. Varsha Gorey, clinical nutritionist, Apollo Hospitals Navi Mumbai, explained that it plays a vital role in maintaining strong bones and teeth, supporting nerve function, muscle contraction, and blood clotting.
“The recommended daily intake of calcium for adults varies but generally falls within the range of 1000-1300 mg. Milk is an excellent source of calcium, providing around 300 mg per cup,” Gorey told indianexpress.com in an interaction.Advertisement
She added that milk’s bioavailability, meaning the body’s ability to absorb and use calcium, is high due to the presence of lactose and other nutrients. Additionally, milk contains vitamin D, which enhances calcium absorption.

 Incorporating a combination of these sources, along with other nutrient-rich foods, helps support overall bone health and fulfills calcium needs for individuals who do not consume milk. (Pic source: Freepik)
Consuming an adequate amount of calcium through sources like milk helps prevent osteoporosis in women, promotes bone health, and supports overall physiological functions, contributing to a well-balanced and healthy adult body.
What are some other calcium-rich alternatives of milk, for those who don’t drink it?
For individuals who don’t consume milk, there are various calcium-rich alternatives to meet their nutritional needs.

Ditching dairy doesn’t mean compromising on calcium. The array of alternatives available today ensures that non-dairy drinkers can embrace a diverse and nutritionally rich diet while meeting their calcium needs. Fortified plant-based milk alternatives, such as almond, soy, or rice milk, often contain similar levels of calcium as cow’s milk.
Green leafy vegetables like kale, collard greens, and bok choy, as well as fortified orange juice, dried apricots and tofu, are excellent non-dairy sources of calcium.
Certain varieties of fish such as shellfish are rich in calcium.

While these alternatives can contribute to meeting adult calcium requirements, it’s essential to plan a diverse and balanced diet to ensure optimal absorption. Incorporating a combination of these sources, along with other nutrient-rich foods, helps support overall bone health and fulfills calcium needs for individuals who do not consume milk.",lifestyle
Malavika Mohanan finds it ‘tough’ to balance the core; here’s a guide to help,"Fitness is as much mentally demanding as it is physically challenging. It is even more so when it comes to balancing the core in certain exercises like box lunges that recently actor Malavika Mohanan was seen trying to perform. “Was finding it hard to balance my core during today’s session with @klinton81 but the point is to keep going and just focus on consistency,” shared Malavika.

Are urban Indian women crumbling under pressure of trying to have it all?,"It was 2014. Indra K Nooyi, the CEO and chairperson of PepsiCo, was having a televised conversation with David Bradley, the chairperson of the American media conglomerate The Atlantic Media. “I don’t think women can have it all. I just don’t think so. We pretend we have it all. We pretend we can have it all,” Nooyi said.
The woman who seemed to have it all but didn’t.
Nooyi was consistently ranked on the Forbes list of The World’s 100 Most Powerful Women from 2008 to 2017, awarded the top spot on the Most Powerful Women in Business ranking by Fortune Magazine five years in a row. She now serves on the boards of Amazon and International Cricket Council (ICC).Advertisement
When a woman who has, unarguably, not just reached the highest echelons of power in the business world but ruled them too has felt this way, we must contemplate why this happens with women. This assumes more significance in the backdrop of several studies conducted in 2023 and earlier finding that women have squarely shouldered the burden of increased stress and anxiety.
 Former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi (Source: Express archive)
This is not to say that men are not stressed. The pandemic exacerbated the amount of stress and anxiety we, as a people, were facing. However, the difference between the stress men and women face is in the nature and scope of it.
A first-of-its-kind global study involving more than 70 institutions, including India’s NIMHANS, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in May 2023, pointed to this fact. It found that in countries like India, which invariably rank higher on the Gender Inequality Index by the United Nations (UN), women exhibited long-lasting changes in how their brains have developed, especially in the regions where stress-induced conditions like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder are found, making them highly vulnerable to these conditions.
Why is this bias presenting itself?
According to Shilpa Khanna Thakkar, CEO, Chicnutrix, each of us plays multiple roles today, whether a father or a mother. The constant expectation not to miss any of these roles sets women and mothers apart.Advertisement
“Consequently, there is an implicit pressure on them to excel in all areas — be it as a mom, a professional, a sister, or a daughter. Falling short of their best is often deemed unacceptable for women, leading to unequal expectations. For instance, even when a woman is at work or in a meeting, she is still expected to answer calls or manage household responsibilities. This unequal burden extends to societal expectations where women are assumed to take care of the house, fulfil traditional motherly duties, and excel in their professional lives,” the 44-year-old mother of two tells indianexpress.com in an interaction.
Prakriti Poddar, a wellbeing expert and the global head of mental health at Roundglass, a global wellness organisation, explained this is because women often take on the lion’s share of the emotional labour of managing families and household work.
A ‘Time Use Survey’ conducted in India by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) in 2019 found that nearly 81 per cent of women have undertaken domestic chores at some point during the day, compared to only 27 per cent of men who reported doing the same. Not to mention, these numbers have been wildly skewed ever since the pandemic struck.

This statistic is the lived reality of 22-year-old Bhavya Gupta. The PR professional wakes up every day to do household chores before heading to the office. Her day ends with preparing dinner and doing the dishes.Advertisement
“My family members say it is like training for me so that I won’t feel any pressure if I become a working woman after marriage,” she says.
This pressure is just as omnipresent in the workplace. Ruchika Bhagat, 49-year-old CA and MD at Neeraj Bhagat & Co., attributes this to the biased thinking that women are naturally more dedicated towards their families. “This puts unequal pressure on women employees to always be at the top of their game at the workplace.”
Prachi S Vaish, clinical psychologist, psychotherapist and feminine energy coach, explained that even though the pressure to perform is spread out equally between men and women, the biased expectation that a woman will not be able to perform up to the mark is more skewed.
“So in case a woman falls short on a task, it kind of becomes a self-confirming bias among bosses because they ‘expected’ it; whereas if a man falls short, his reasons will get space to be heard and acknowledged (unless they have established a pattern of making excuses),” Vaish says.Advertisement
Priyanka Pani, a 42-year-old journalist-turned-PR founder, confesses to having panic attacks and crying alone to vent out her frustrations. “It’s overwhelmingly challenging to be the best at everything. Women are conditioned to be the givers and are expected to be a great multitasker in holding the family and career together.”
According to sociologist Pranay Aggarwal, who has served as India’s representative in UNESCO’s International Sociological Association, we place a premium on women’s ability to excel at home and work.
“We worship women in their roles as mothers and wives and we literally put them on a pedestal. So that puts a lot of pressure on women to be perfect wives, mothers, caregivers and homemakers. Likewise, he says, women are burdened with many societal expectations at the workplace, too.
Aggarwal quoted the Global Gender Gap Report of 2023 brought out by the World Economic Forum, adding that because of this pressure, there are only 25 per cent of women at the C-Soot level (executives, directors, CEOs, CFOs, etc).Advertisement
 Even though the pressure to perform is spread out equally between men and women, the biased expectation that a woman will not be able to perform up to the mark is more skewed. (File image)
Measured at four parameters, political participation, economic empowerment, health as well as education, the global index has found that if things go as they are, it will take 131 years to achieve full gender parity, showing a significant slowdown in the overall rate of change.
It is an entirely different ballgame for women working in the informal sector and coming from strained financial backgrounds. A research paper published in the International Journal of Indian Psychology found women workers in the informal sector to be suffering from poor sleep due to perpetual worrying and overthinking. They also suffer from constant physical fatigue and display restlessness at work, making concentrating on the task at hand difficult.
How can you help yourself?
Poddar believes that change starts with you. Women need to take responsibility for their wellbeing and prioritise it by being kind to themselves and taking good care of their physical and mental health. According to her, women need to take even a few minutes each day for movement; focus on eating nourishing food; practise deep breathing, meditation, or mindfulness for their mental and spiritual wellbeing; and try to get seven to eight hours of good sleep at night.
“Whenever I’m overwhelmed, I like to use 4-7-8 breathing. I breathe in for a count of four, hold for seven, then exhale to a count of eight. After a few rounds, I can feel the tension melting,” Poddar adds.Advertisement
According to Rucha Shrikhande Divekar, a clinical psychologist at Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune, encouraging women to prioritise their wellbeing is pivotal for achieving their personal and professional goals. “This shift in focus can help them navigate societal expectations effectively. It is essential to move away from the self-righteousness of past generations and create a more inclusive environment.”
Thakkar, a CEO herself, confesses to self-doubt creeping in but says using the first person to discuss achievements has helped her in the workplace. “It might be perceived as self-promotion, however, it’s crucial for women to embrace and communicate their successes confidently. By doing so, they not only validate their contributions but also inspire others in similar roles.”

“Learn to say no and draw healthy boundaries. Do the same at home to free up more time for yourself. In most cultures, the household is a highly gendered space, with women shouldering the bulk of domestic and childcare tasks,” Poddar added.
Vaish, as a psychologist, agrees that while this is indeed a societal problem, it can still be tackled individually.Advertisement
“Respect is not received by asking. It is garnered by creating your own high value. So, if you believe you are treated with bias, then learn to take an assertive stand, not an aggressive one. An aggressive stand (whether taken by a man or a woman) always makes the other party defensive. On the other hand, an assertive stand creates high value for you even if you sometimes don’t get what you want. Work with a coach/therapist, practice assertive scripts, and identify your own trigger points to operate from an empowered space,” Vaish advised.

Vikas Khanna recreates steamed banana treat that Lata Mangeshkar loved,"In the 35+ years of his culinary journey, chef Vikas Khanna has cooked for many greats. One such, he recently shared, was the Nightingale of India, singer Lata Mangeshkar. On her request for a prasad for her prayers, the chef prepared a luscious, steamed banana prasad. He shared the anecdote, “Many years ago, I think 2013 Lata ji invited me to Prabhu Kunj, and she asked me to cook prasad for the prayers. My heart’s wish was granted. I steamed baby bananas stuffed with jaggery-coconut-cardamom-sesame seeds. As we are celebrating her legacy in Ayodhya, I wanted to share the simple recipe that Didi loved.”
Before we dive into the recipe, here’s how steamed bananas make for a great sweet treat.
According to clinical dietitian Garima Goyal, this cooking method not only enhances the natural sweetness of the fruit but also preserves essential nutrients, making it a favourable choice for those mindful of their well-being.Advertisement
“Steaming helps retain water-soluble vitamins like vitamin C and B-complex vitamins, which can be sensitive to heat. By preserving these vitamins, steamed bananas offer a more comprehensive nutritional profile compared to their counterparts cooked through other means,” she added.
Goyal explained that bananas, in their raw state, are already a nutrient-packed fruit. “They are a rich source of potassium, an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in maintaining proper heart function, muscle contractions, and fluid balance in the body. Potassium also supports nerve signaling and helps regulate blood pressure. Additionally, bananas contain dietary fibre, primarily in the form of pectin, which aids digestion and promotes a feeling of fullness.”

Moreover, steamed bananas, with their inherent sweetness, eliminate the need for additional sugar, making them a wholesome alternative for those aiming to reduce their sugar consumption. “Whether enjoyed on their own or as part of a creative dish, steamed bananas offer a guilt-free dessert option that aligns with a balanced and nutritious eating plan,” said Goyal.
Chef Vikas Khanna demonstrated the recipe
Ingredients 
– Ripe bananas (1 per serving)
– 2 tablespoons of honey or maple syrup
– 1/4 cup of chopped nuts (walnuts, almonds, or your preference)
– 1/4 cup of shredded coconut

Samantha Ruth Prabhu bats for ozone therapy; experts urge caution,"Samantha Ruth Prabhu has been working even more on her fitness, health, and immunity after her myositis diagnosis, which is an autoimmune condition. As such, the Kushi actor took to her Instagram Stories to share the benefits of ozone therapy, which is touted to work for skin health and immunity.
What is Ozone Therapy?
Dr Jatin Mittal, skin expert, cosmetologist, and co-founder, Abhivrit Aesthetics, New Delhi said that ozone therapy involves the medical use of ozone gas, a molecule composed of three oxygen atoms, for therapeutic purposes. “While some proponents suggest that ozone therapy may have positive effects on immunity and skin health, it’s essential to note that the scientific evidence supporting these claims is limited, and the therapy is considered controversial,” said Dr Mittal.
According to Dr Mittal, ozone therapy can be used in treating under-eye puffiness, settling acne inflammation, instant scalp cleaning in dandruff, in treating eczema or psoriasis but it is not a certified science and it’s not FDA-approved. He further said its efficacy is not well-established, and there are “potential risks” associated with its use. “Individuals considering such therapies should seek guidance from healthcare professionals and rely on evidence-based practices for maintaining overall well-being,” said Dr Mittal.Advertisement
 What is ozone therapy all about? (representative) (Source: Freepik)
Here are some considerations regarding ozone therapy for immunity and skin health
For immunity
Ozone is believed to enhance the production of cytokines, proteins that play a crucial role in immune response regulation. Additionally, it may stimulate the production of white blood cells, which are essential for fighting infections. However, scientific evidence supporting these claims is limited and inconclusive, said Dr Rinky Kapoor, consultant dermatologist, cosmetic dermatologist, and dermato-surgeon, The Esthetic Clinics.
Skin health
Antimicrobial properties: Ozone has antimicrobial properties, and it is used in some cases to treat skin conditions with bacterial or fungal origins.
Wound healing: Ozone therapy has been suggested to promote wound healing by improving oxygen supply to tissues, but research on its effectiveness is still in the early stages, said Dr Mittal.Advertisement
Administration methods
Ozone therapy can be administered in various ways, such as through ozone gas injections, ozonated oils, or intravenous infusions. The method depends on the targeted health concern, mentioned Dr Kapoor.
Considerations and caution
Ozone therapy can have side effects, including irritation of the respiratory system when inhaled, and potential harm to the skin if not administered properly. “Ozone is a highly reactive gas and can potentially cause respiratory irritation when inhaled. In the case of intravenous administration, there’s a risk of embolism due to gas bubbles entering the bloodstream. The concentration and duration of exposure are crucial factors influencing the safety of ozone therapy,” said Dr Kapoor.
Ozone therapy is not universally accepted or regulated as a standard medical practice, and there may be variations in how it is administered.
Contraindications
Ozone therapy may not be suitable for everyone. “Pregnant women, individuals with thyroid disorders, and those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency should avoid ozone therapy. Additionally, people with respiratory conditions may be at an increased risk of adverse effects,” said Dr Kapoor.Advertisement

Professional guidance
Before considering ozone therapy, individuals must consult with qualified healthcare professionals who can assess the potential risks and benefits based on individual health conditions.
The experts urge that given the limited scientific evidence, individuals are encouraged to rely on established, evidence-based approaches for maintaining immunity and skin health, such as a balanced diet, regular exercise, and proper skincare.

Veganuary: Nutritionists weigh the pros and cons of a vegan diet,"From Sonam Kapoor to Shahid Kapoor, many of our beloved celebrities have turned vegan, owing to ethical and health considerations. With Veganuary here, an annual movement challenging individuals worldwide to embrace a plant-based lifestyle for January, there has been substantial momentum in adopting veganism since its inception in 2014. With the month coming to an end, thousands across the globe pledged to forgo animal products throughout this month. However, is embracing a vegan diet a healthy choice? And how does it compare to a non-vegetarian diet? We talked to nutritionists to find out.
The pros
Ritika Samaddar, regional head – South Zone, nutrition and dietetics, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket describes a vegan diet as one exclusively composed of plant-based foods, excluding all forms of animal or animal products, including staples like milk, ghee, and honey. “A healthy vegan diet encompasses a variety of food groups such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes,” she said.
She highlighted that a well-balanced vegan diet can be rich in antioxidants, phytonutrients, and fibre. “Various studies have suggested that such a diet can prevent certain forms of cancer, particularly those related to the gastrointestinal tract,” Samaddar explained.Advertisement
Additionally, the nutritionist noted the positive impact on dyslipidemias (unhealthy levels of lipids in the blood), leading to a reduction in low bad cholesterol levels.
In a similar vein, Manisha Choudhary, consultant – dietitian and nutritionist, Motherhood Hospitals, Noida said that the abundance of plant-based foods contributes to improved digestive health and weight management by imparting a sense of satiety or fullness.
Even for pregnant women, embracing a vegan diet can offer notable benefits for both the mother and the developing baby. “The abundance of folate, vitamins, and minerals supports the prevention of neural tube defects and ensures proper growth. The lower intake of saturated fats in a vegan diet may contribute to a healthier pregnancy, reducing the risk of gestational diabetes and hypertension. Additionally, the fibre content aids in maintaining steady blood sugar levels,” Choudhary advised.
The flip side
 What are the advantages and disadvantages of veganism? (Source: Freepik)
In the pursuit of a vegan diet, it’s imperative to address potential nutritional gaps that may arise due to the exclusion of certain food groups.Advertisement
“Key nutrients such as vitamin B12, iron, zinc, omega-3 fatty acids, and protein, which are abundant in animal products, require careful attention. Vegans may need to incorporate fortified foods or supplements to ensure optimal intake of these vital nutrients,” explained Choudhary.
Samaddar recommended incorporating necessary supplements like vitamin D and B12, which may be deficient due to the absence of dairy and non-vegetarian foods. “Despite the potential deficiencies, a well-planned vegan diet, including alternative sources of calcium and vitamin D, nuts, seeds, lentils, oats, and millets, can meet protein requirements.”
Which is better: A vegan or non-vegetarian diet?
Citing studies, Samaddar pointed out that a vegan diet can aid in weight loss. “The reduction in total fat consumption and the high fibre content in plant-based diets contribute to this effect, differentiating it from meat-based or non-vegetarian diets, often high in saturated fats.”
Apart from this, the exclusion of red and processed meats further adds to the potential health benefits of a vegan diet, particularly for cardiovascular health, noted Choudhary. “The naturally low levels of saturated fats and cholesterol in a vegan diet, potentially impact cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease.”Advertisement
However, it’s important to understand that the idea that a vegan diet is categorically superior to a meat-based one oversimplifies the complexities of nutritional science. “Both dietary approaches can be healthy if thoughtfully planned. A well-balanced meat-based diet, focusing on lean proteins, whole grains, and a variety of fruits and vegetables, can also provide a rich array of essential nutrients,” said Choudhary.

Ways to recognise efforts of employees and create healthier workplace,"In many workplaces, there might be a communication breakdown between management and employees. Often, leaders are caught up in between the daily demands of running a business and acknowledging individual contributions. This can create an environment where employees feel undervalued and overlooked.
Suchandra Sarkar, QC specialist from the entertainment industry, rues that despite “consistently contributing my best efforts at work, recognition seems elusive.” “I believe acknowledgment fosters a positive work environment, motivating individuals to excel. But a lack of it creates feelings of undervaluation, potentially resulting in disengagement and a higher likelihood of seeking opportunities elsewhere,” adds Sarkar.
Recognising employees is not just a feel-good gesture; it directly contributes to a healthier and more productive work environment. “Employee recognition is critical to fostering a positive workplace culture. Understanding why a lack of employee recognition occurs is pivotal in addressing the issue. Several common reasons include inadequate communication, oversight, or a need for more awareness regarding the impact of recognition on employee morale,” says Mansi Poddar, psychotherapist, and founder, Heal. Grow. Thrive Foundation.Advertisement
There can also be a gap in training for managers on the importance of recognition and how to effectively convey it, says Neel Juriasingani, CEO and Co-Founder, Datacultr.
As mentioned, oversight plays a big part. In larger organisations, it’s easy for the achievements of individual employees to get lost in the shuffle. Managers may only sometimes be aware of the day-to-day accomplishments of their team members, leading to a lack of recognition for noteworthy efforts. “Generally speaking, most people do want to recognise good work, but often, it gets lost amongst daily priorities,” admits Deepti Sagar, chief people officer, Deloitte India.
However, many companies are slowly realising the importance of recognising their employees. They understand that acknowledgment fosters a sense of appreciation and motivates employees to excel.
Moreover, employee recognition contributes to a sense of belonging and loyalty. Baldev Raj, founder, and chief, Prius Communications, says, “When individuals feel recognised and appreciated, they are more likely to develop a strong connection with their organisation. This emotional connection fosters loyalty and reduces attrition rates, as employees are less inclined to seek opportunities elsewhere when they feel their contributions are genuinely valued.”Advertisement
“I believe employees should be motivated periodically, and acknowledgment should be expressed through appreciation, bonuses, salary increments, off-site events, picnics, or tours. This not only maintains a strong bond between the company and existing employees but also attracts talent from the industry,” Raj adds.
According to Juriasingani, recognition leads to higher job satisfaction and lower turnover rates. “Recognition also fosters a positive work environment, encourages team spirit, and can even enhance the company’s reputation as a desirable employer,” says Juriasingani.
Through firsthand experience, Zeeshan Ali, a senior communication consultant, says he has witnessed a “remarkable transformation in team dynamics, a shift in work ethos, and a surge of positivity” that recognition injects into the workplace. “Furthermore, this acknowledgment enhances loyalty and integrity, to take the organisation to new levels of accomplishment,” says Zeeshan.
 Here’s what to consider (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)
As a result, many organisations are implementing structured recognition programs.Advertisement
Realistic measures
Leadership has a crucial role in setting the tone. “We have a special reward called the President’s Bonus, where the senior-most leaders in every business nominate professionals who have exemplified our shared values, for an extra monetary bonus, over and above the performance bonus they already receive,” says Sagar.
Then there are appreciation weeks where everyone comes together to express their gratitude towards someone who made a positive impact in their life during the year. “Considering the size and scope of our organisation, we have bespoke awards done at the business or team level too. For instance, for the top recruiter and people who have completed the most learning programmes,” mentions Sagar.
Steps to implement
Here are some of the steps you should implement in your organisation, according to Poddar.
Establishment of formal recognition programs – Implement formal recognition programs highlighting outstanding achievements. These can include regular awards, shout-outs in team meetings, or even monetary rewards. By creating a systematic approach to recognition, companies ensure that no employee’s efforts go unnoticed.Advertisement
Juriasingani mentioned creating a platform for public acknowledgment further reinforces a culture of appreciation.
Conduct leadership workshops and seminars – Educate managers on the positive impact of acknowledging and appreciating their team members. This helps in creating a culture where recognition becomes an integral part of the organisational ethos.

Integrating recognition into performance reviews – Linking employee recognition with performance reviews can be a strategic move. Acknowledging and rewarding achievements during performance evaluations not only motivates employees but also reinforces the connection between individual contributions and organisational success.
Seeking employee feedback – Engaging employees in the process by seeking their feedback on recognition initiatives is vital. Companies can conduct surveys or hold focus group discussions to understand what forms of recognition resonate most with the workforce. This inclusive approach ensures that recognition efforts are well-received and aligned with employee preferences.Advertisement
Celebrating milestones and achievements – Beyond day-to-day recognition, celebrating significant milestones and achievements is pivotal. Whether it’s work anniversaries, project completions, or personal accomplishments, marking these occasions with special recognition events or rewards adds a layer of appreciation and demonstrates the company’s commitment to its employees’ growth and success.
Thus, addressing the lack of employee recognition involves a multifaceted approach. “By implementing a strategic approach, organisations can establish a comprehensive and effective framework for acknowledging and appreciating their workforce. This commitment not only boosts morale but also contributes to creating a workplace where employees feel valued, motivated, and integral to organisational success,” Poddar further shares.

"Women, add these 5 yoga asanas to your daily routine","Women often forget to take care of their health and well-being, having to devote their time to their kids, jobs, house chores and what not. In such a scenario, yoga offers a sanctuary for women seeking holistic wellness. The ancient practice not only enhances physical flexibility but also nurtures mental and emotional resilience.
Through an Instagram post, celebrity yoga and holistic wellness expert, Anshuka Parwani, shared 5 yoga asanas women can practice daily. “We women are always on the go and great multi-taskers, but in the process, we tend to ignore our health and well-being,” Parwani captioned the post. “These asanas are beginner-friendly, will work on your entire body, and leave you feeling refreshed and energized,” she added.
1. Baddhakonasana
Also known as Bound Angle Pose or Cobbler’s Pose, Baddhakonasana is a seated yoga asana often used to open the hips and groin. According to Manushreya Sharma, a certified yoga instructor, this pose helps regulate bowel movement, stretches the knees, and stimulates circulation in the legs. “It also removes fatigue from long hours of standing and walking as well as offers relief from menstrual discomfort and menopause symptoms,” she said.Advertisement
However, if you are suffering from a groin or knee injury, Sharma advises individuals to keep a blanket under the outer thighs for support. Additionally, sciatic patients should either completely avoid the pose or sit on a cushion to raise the hips.
Steps:

Begin by sitting on your yoga mat with your legs extended straight in front of you.
Bend your knees and bring the soles of your feet together, allowing your knees to drop out to the sides. Your feet should be close to your pelvis.
Hold your feet with your hands. You can loop your hands around your feet and clasp your fingers, creating a bind.
Sit up tall and lengthen your spine. Avoid rounding your back; instead, try to keep a straight and upright posture.
Gently press your knees toward the floor, using your elbows to encourage a gentle opening in the hips. Avoid forcing the knees down; allow the stretch to happen gradually.
Take slow and deep breaths, allowing the hips to open with each exhale. Focus on maintaining a relaxed and steady breath throughout the pose.

2. Malasana

Malasana, also known as Garland Pose, involves squatting down on the floor. “Malasana engages and strengthens various muscles, including quadriceps, hamstrings, and the lower back and core muscles. It is good for the digestive system as it compresses the abdominal area, helping eliminate digestive issues and bloating,” Sharma said.
However, individuals with lower back, hip, foot, or ankle injuries should refrain from performing this asana.
Steps:

Begin by standing with your feet width apart on the mat.
Turn your toes slightly outward. This foot position will make it easier to squat deeply.
Inhale and bend the knees and lower your butt to come into the squat position.
While squatting down, open your knees wider than your hip width.
Once you attain a deep squat, bring your palms together in a prayer position (Namaste) before your chest. This gesture adds a meditative element to the pose.
Keep your spine as straight as possible and your shoulder relaxed and away from your ears. Your butt should move towards the floor.
Hold the pose for around five breaths.
Exit the pose by straightening the legs slowly.
A forward fold can be done after this.

3. Parivrtta Sukhasana
Sukhasana refers to a simple seated cross-legged pose, and Parivrtta denotes a twist or revolved variation of it. This twisting motion also stretches the upper back and spine, Sharma said. “This can help increase flexibility and reduce tension and stress.” Additionally, the twisting in the pose massages the abdominal organs, which helps stimulate digestion.Advertisement
Sharma advises those with knee and ankle issues to avoid this pose, and those with back problems to practice gently with care and not overexert.
Steps:

Sit in Sukhasana on your mat.
Cross legs at ankles and place them to the side.
Press palms together in front of the chest, then bring hands down so that they rest on knees with fingers pointing toward the floor.
Turn the torso slightly away from the crossed leg by shifting weight onto the outer hip bone (the one closest to where you’re sitting).
Twist the torso further until shoulder blades are touching each other behind the back.
Keep holding this pose while breathing deeply.

4. Naukasana

In Naukasana, the body takes a shape resembling a boat. “The pose helps build muscular strength, focuses your mind, stimulates the digestive system and boosts energy in the body,” Sharma said. However, women who are pregnant or on their menstrual cycle should skip practicing this pose.
Steps:

Begin by lying on your back (supine) on a yoga mat, with your legs extended and arms by your sides.
Inhale as you lift your legs off the mat, keeping them straight. Engage your core muscles to support your lower back.
Continue to inhale as you lift your upper body off the mat, reaching your arms toward your lifted legs. Your body should form a V-shape.
Balance on your sit bones, keeping your spine straight. Your body should resemble a boat, with your legs and upper body forming the hull.
If comfortable, extend your arms forward alongside your legs, parallel to the floor. Keep your gaze fixed at a point on the horizon to help with balance.
Hold the pose for a few breaths, breathing deeply. Focus on engaging the abdominal muscles and maintaining a strong, straight spine.
Exhale as you gently lower your legs and upper body back to the mat.

5. Viparita Karani
Viparita Karani, also known as Legs Up the Wall Pose, is a rejuvenating and restorative yoga pose. “It is effective for increasing the blood flow towards the brain. The asana also induces a calming effect, leading to stress reduction and relaxation,” Sharma explained. However, people with hypertension, heart ailments, pregnancy, respiratory disorders, and spinal disorders should avoid this posture.
Steps:

Lie down on your back on the floor.
Fold your knees, trying to move your legs up towards your stomach so that the thighs are touching and pressing your stomach.
Now, lift your hips above the floor while exhaling; during this, hold your waist from both sides using both hands.
While exhaling, raise the legs ultimately, letting your body weight fall on the elbows while the elbows are resting on the floor.
You can also use the wall for support while trying to get into this posture.
Beginners can perform this pose by putting pillows, blankets, or bolsters under the waist. This will help support your lower back and mid-back. Now you may stretch your legs up the wall while allowing your shoulder blades and head to rest on the floor.

Make Deepika Padukone’s favourite dish Ema Datshi at home,"One glimpse at Deepika Padukone’s Instagram grid and you’ll quickly find out that she is a big-time foodie like most of us. A testament to her culinary adventures is her visit to Bhutan last year in April, where the Bollywood diva unveiled the hidden gems of the Land of the Thunder Dragon. Amidst the breathtaking landscapes and cultural escapades, Deepika couldn’t resist sharing her gastronomic delights with her followers. The focal point of her Bhutanese culinary affair was none other than Ema Datshi, which is hailed as the national dish of Bhutan.
Ema Datshi — a stew-like masterpiece — is a tantalising blend of fiery chillies and melted cheese, creating a symphony of flavours that satiate the taste buds. So, if you’re wondering how to recreate this delectable dish in your own kitchen, bloggers Dr Rupali and Saloni Tak took to Instagram to share its recipe.
Ingredients

4-5 large green chillies
1 cup of Bhutanese or any other mild cheese (feta or Swiss cheese can be used as substitutes)
1 large onion, thinly sliced
2 tomatoes, diced
3 cloves of garlic, minced
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
Salt to taste

Method

Wash the green chillies and slit them lengthwise, leaving the stems intact. This helps to control the spiciness.
Heat vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat.
Add thinly sliced onions and minced garlic. Sauté until the onions become translucent.
Add the slit green chillies to the pan and continue to sauté for a few minutes. The chillies should be slightly softened but still have a crunch.
Add diced tomatoes to the pan and cook until they release their juices and become soft.
Cut the cheese into small cubes and add it to the pan. Stir continuously until the cheese melts and forms a creamy consistency.
Allow the mixture to simmer over low heat for about 5-7 minutes. This helps the flavours to meld together.
Season the Ema Datshi with salt according to your taste. Bhutanese cuisine often uses salt sparingly, so start with a small amount and adjust as needed.
Once the cheese has melted completely, and the mixture has thickened, your Ema Datshi is ready to be served.
You can garnish the dish with fresh cilantro or parsley for added flavour and a pop of colour.
Ema Datshi is typically served with red rice in Bhutan, but you can enjoy it with any type of rice or flatbreads.

"Learn the Japanese art of letting go to live a healthier, happier life","The Japanese are known for their long lifespan. And much of the credit for that goes to their life philosophies; one of the most important being shikata ga nai. 
According to Dr Parth Nagda, psychiatrist at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital Navi Mumbai, shikata ga nai is a Japanese phrase that translates to “it cannot be helped” or “there’s nothing that can be done.” This phrase is associated with a philosophical approach to accepting situations that are beyond one’s control and finding peace in letting go of the need to control everything.
“Living a longer and healthier life typically involves a combination of factors such as maintaining a balanced diet, engaging in regular physical activity, managing stress, getting enough sleep, and avoiding harmful habits. Incorporating mindfulness, acceptance, and a positive outlook is just one aspect of a holistic approach to well-being,” explained Dr Nagda in an interaction with indianexpress.comAdvertisement
This concept should not be interpreted as passivity or resignation in all situations. In some cases, taking proactive steps to improve one’s circumstances or health is still important.
Some strategies to help you navigate challenges and cultivate a more accepting approach to life, according to Dr Nagda are the following:
 Here’s how shikata ga nai benefits you (Source: Freepik)
This is how to apply shikata ga nai to your life
1) Mindfulness meditation: Setting time aside f­or this can help you cultivate awareness of the present moment and develop a non-judgmental acceptance of your thoughts and feelings.
2) Positive affirmations: Incorporate positive affirmations into your daily routine.
3) Gratitude journaling: Start a gratitude journal. This shifts your focus towards positive aspects of your life and fosters a sense of contentment.Advertisement
4) Acceptance: Focus your energy on those areas which you can control and accept the rest.
5) Challenge negative thoughts: Ask yourself if these thoughts are based on reality or if they are distorted. Reframe negative thoughts into more constructive and realistic perspectives.
6) Connect with friends, family, or a support group: Share your thoughts and feelings with people you trust. Having a support system can provide comfort and different perspectives on challenging situations.
7) Take breaks and practice self-care: Engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Taking care of your physical and mental well-being contributes to a more resilient mindset.Advertisement
8) Learn from challenges: Instead of viewing challenges as insurmountable obstacles, see them as opportunities for learning and growth.
9) Set realistic expectations: Manage your expectations by setting realistic goals for yourself. Understand that not everything will go as planned, and that’s okay. Adjust your expectations to align with the unpredictability of life.
10) Seek professional help, if needed: If you find it challenging to implement these practices on your own or if you’re facing persistent difficulties, consider seeking guidance from a mental health professional.
Remember that applying these concepts is a gradual process, and it’s okay to take small steps.Advertisement

Dopamine dressing is the newest fashion trend on the block but what is it?,"In the ever-evolving world of fashion, the concept of dopamine dressing has emerged as a trend that goes beyond mere aesthetics. The idea behind this phenomenon is rooted in the belief that what we wear can significantly impact our mood and overall well-being. Just as the neurotransmitter dopamine is associated with pleasure and reward, incorporating vibrant and joyful colours into our wardrobe is believed to trigger positive emotions.
Designer Shilpi Gupta explained that the trend has gained popularity as individuals are now recognising “the fact that dressing and emotions are strongly connected.”
“The synchronisation of colours, textures, and clothing styles affects our disposition by releasing energetic hormones that evoke a sense of pleasure and positivity. The trend highlights the psychological and emotional dimensions of fashion beyond mere aesthetics by dressing in a manner that aligns with their style,” she said in an interaction with indianexpress.com. Advertisement
The Science of Dopamine and Colour
Dopamine, often referred to as the “feel-good” neurotransmitter, plays a crucial role in regulating mood, pleasure, and motivation.
Scientific studies suggest that exposure to certain colours can stimulate the release of dopamine in the brain, influencing our emotions and perceptions. A study titled “Impact of Colour on Marketing” was conducted at the University of Winnipeg to explore the impact of colour on consumer perceptions and emotions in marketing. While it doesn’t specifically address dopamine release, it discusses how colour can evoke emotional responses, influencing consumer behaviour.
Dopamine dressing takes advantage of this connection by encouraging individuals to intentionally choose clothing in colors that evoke happiness and positivity.

How to Incorporate Dopamine Dressing into Your Wardrobe

Embrace Vibrant Hues: Infuse your wardrobe with bright and lively colours that resonate with your personal style. Choose colours that make you feel energised and confident, whether bold red, sunny yellow, or vibrant turquoise.
Play with Prints and Patterns: Experiment with playful prints and patterns that add an element of joy to your outfit. Floral prints, stripes, or geometric patterns in cheerful colour palettes can instantly lift your spirits.
Mix and Match Bold Accessories: If you’re not ready to commit to an entirely colourful ensemble, incorporate bold accessories. A vibrant handbag, a pair of statement earrings, or colourful shoes can add a pop of excitement to even the simplest outfit.
Express Yourself with Colour Psychology: Consider the psychological impact of different colors on mood. For example, red is associated with energy and passion, yellow with happiness and optimism, and blue with calmness and tranquility. Choose colours that align with the emotions you want to evoke.
Personalise Your Palette: Your ideal dopamine dressing palette is unique to you. Pay attention to the colors that resonate with your personality and make you feel good. Whether it’s pastels, jewel tones, or earthy shades, create a wardrobe that reflects your individual style and preferences.

Beyond the aesthetic appeal, dopamine dressing is about cultivating a positive mindset and boosting overall well-being. When you feel good in what you wear, it can positively influence your confidence, mood, and how you approach the day.

Why take fibre first after 16 hours of intermittent fasting?,"After 16 hours of intermittent fasting, it can be smart and beneficial to eat a first meal consisting primarily of high-fibre foods. This is something TV host Mini Mathur swears by. Mini, who is extremely particular about her diet and fitness, shared in an Instagram story, “Brekkie after 16 hours of intermittent fasting. Fibre first. Salad leaves of all kinds, strawberries, fig, alfa alfa sprouts, mung sprouts, blueberries, pineapple, one egg.”
Taking a leaf out of Mini’s brekkie salad, here’s why consuming fibre, particularly in the morning is good for you.
Nutritionist Apurva Agarwal said that fibre helps you feel satisfied and full, which might help you manage your hunger all day. “Breaking the fast on a high-fibre meal can help keep you from overindulging later in the day after intermittent fasting. Those who are trying to control their weight or follow a diet low in calories will especially benefit from this,” said Agarwal.Advertisement
Fibre is essential for maintaining intestinal health. Agarwal said that it promotes a healthy gut microbiota, helps control bowel motions, and avoids constipation. “After a fast, when the digestive system may need to adjust to food intake, a high-fibre breakfast helps support regularity and a healthy digestive system,” said Agarwal.
Moreover, eating fibre first thing in the morning may help lower blood sugar levels. Because fibre reduces the rate at which sugars are absorbed, blood glucose levels are more stable. “This can help prevent rapid spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels. Additionally, a high-fibre breakfast supports gut health by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria in the digestive system,” said Payal Sharma, senior dietician, Dharamshila Narayana Superspeciality Hospital.

Agarwal noted that it’s important to choose complete, high-nutrient sources of fibre for breakfast. “Include nuts, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in your morning meal. These foods improve general health by offering a variety of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fibre,” said Agarwal.
Agreed, Sharma and said that one should consider incorporating whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and seeds into one’s breakfast to boost fibre intake. “These foods not only provide essential nutrients but also contribute to a well-balanced and satisfying meal,” said Sharma.Advertisement

"On your weight loss journey, watch out for these 3 challenges (with tips to tackle them)","Embarking on your long-awaited weight loss journey is an exciting venture, but it’s essential to be mindful of potential challenges that may arise. Apurwa Agarwal, a certified nutritionist, took to Instagram to highlight three things you must watch out for on your fitness journey — hair loss, stretch marks, and skin sagging.
To proactively address these issues, consider incorporating these key practices right from the start.
Hair loss

On your weight loss journey, the possibility of experiencing hair fall is a common concern. “This phenomenon occurs when individuals attempt to compromise on their diet while shedding weight, leading to potential nutrient deficiencies. The compromise on essential nutrients, coupled with factors such as nutritional hormonal imbalances and stress induced by fasting or intense physical activities, can contribute to hair loss,” Dr Seema Oberoi Lall, consultant, dermatology, CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram, told indianexpress.com.Advertisement
To combat hair loss, Agarwal recommends integrating hair supplements into your routine, which can play a protective role in preventing excessive hair loss during dieting. Individuals should also take a comprehensive blood test to assess vital indicators like vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, and ferritin levels.
Further, to counteract this issue, it is crucial to avoid crash dieting, as it not only proves detrimental but also lacks sustainability in the long run. Additionally, Dr Lall advises regular thyroid check-ups to check conditions like hypothyroidism that can contribute to excessive weight and hair loss.
Stretch marks
Stretch marks are essentially scars that become more noticeable when the skin is stretched beyond its capacity. Dr Lall said that stretch marks do not appear due to weight loss itself but become more evident as the skin adjusts to reduced dimensions.
When it comes to preventing and treating stretch marks, hydration is paramount. “Ensure you hydrate not only from within but also externally by moisturising your skin regularly. Consider massaging stretch-prone areas with coconut oil or mustard oil, as this can contribute to maintaining skin elasticity,” Agarwal noted.Advertisement
Apart from this, Dr Lall recommends using prescription-based creams that may improve their appearance, however, children or pregnant women should refrain from using these. Laser treatments, such as ResurFX, can also aid in lightening stretch marks.
Skin sagging
 Preventing significant fluctuations in body size is advised to minimise sagging. (Source: Freepik)
Skin sagging during weight loss occurs when the skin has been stretched due to an increase in body size, and subsequent weight loss does not cause the skin to contract. Preventing significant fluctuations in body size is advised to minimise sagging.
Additionally, Agarwal advises daily exercise such as strength training, which plays a crucial role in toning the skin, aligning with your weight loss goals.

While exercise can help to some extent, Dr Lall suggest treatments like High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) or radio frequency tightening to provide some skin tightening.

‘Our culture enables matrimonial fraud’: Filmmaker Tanuja Chandra on the chief lesson learnt while directing her latest,"For Tanuja Chandra, director of films like Dushman, Sangharsh, and Sur, the female genre is an “abiding passion”, the importance of which never dimmed in her career. This is why it is not surprising to find her helming yet another women-centric project: Wedding.con, a show that deals with matrimonial fraud in India.
But unlike in filmmaking, for the documentary series – which she calls “a very relevant story of contemporary times” – Tanuja Chandra had to work with a certain unpredictability, which is not the case in fiction. So, how did she manage it all? Find out as the filmmaker talks to us about her latest project and how she navigated the intricacies of documentary filmmaking. Chandra also opens up about her journey, her quest to tell powerful women-focused stories, and why we have not seen her work as much as we would like to. Read the edited excerpts below:
Could you tell us about Wedding.con — its conceptualisation, making, and the overall experience?Advertisement
Over two years ago, I was approached by Neha Khurana (of BBC Studios) to direct a series dealing with matrimonial fraud. At the time, I was shocked to discover that this was happening in such huge numbers in India. I was immediately drawn to it and joined their team, which had already been researching this for a while. It was a complex journey requiring us to decide who our main contributors would be and then meet them, conduct mock interviews, do intense pre-production for the interviews, recreate their experiences, and then do the long edit of the series. It has been a challenging journey but a very fulfilling one.
The series falls in line with your body of work which is largely female-centric. Is that what urged you to take it up?
Always! The female genre is my abiding passion and its importance in my career has never waned. But beyond that, the subject was riveting to me. And it needed urgent attention. It is a very relevant story of contemporary times and I wanted to be the one telling it.

You spoke to five women who were deceived on the pretext of marriage. How willing were they to open up? What was most challenging?Advertisement
These are extraordinary women, each in her special way. It is very courageous of them to have agreed to speak to us because in a country like India where women are too often shamed for making mistakes, they knew that it would not be easy. Even for the ones not revealing their identities, it involved walking down a painful memory lane.
For me, one thing was crystal clear: I had zero judgment in my mind. For me, there was not an iota of blame that was to be on them. They had been ruthlessly exploited and all my support was for them. I was a hundred per cent on their side. Ours was a safe space in which they could open their hearts out, which they did. They never felt a sense of being interrogated or patronised in the least. My producers were very careful to make them feel comfortable – to the extent that there was a therapist on the set, should any of them feel triggered by memories and need to talk to someone.
Yes, it was tricky to get them to shed their nervousness because they had never faced a camera or a production crew before in their lives. But that is something one always has to navigate in documentary filmmaking.
How different was the experience of directing a docu-series compared to a film?Advertisement
These are real people, not actors with a script. So there is unpredictability. We never know what we will get. That is partly true for fiction as well, but not to this extent. In the parts that were recreated or fictionalised, we had actors of course, but we had to devise a new visual language because we did not want much of the faces of actors to show. So one would shoot in such a way that half their faces showed or they were in the shadows.
I found this exciting, though. It was just so interesting to direct in a way that makes the shots poetic without revealing much. The editing of a documentary is, of course, very different from fiction. We can pretty much go down several routes of narration and play around with structure. While that is really tough and complicated, it is also a lot of fun. Maintaining a fine balance between the plot and the emotions is always tricky business and our editor, Parikshhit Jha, brought a world of sensitivity and thrill to the series.
 A still from the documentary.
While speaking to the women, how much of the ‘director’ in you did you have to keep aside to connect with them more?
A director must at all times keep empathy alive even while making fiction because without that the characters will end up being somewhat flat and one-dimensional. That said, in documentary one has to stay gentle most of the time. Even a small amount of aggression is bound to make subjects shut down and that is always the fear.Advertisement
One does not want to nudge them towards saying something either – it all needs to come from them. Only then will the truth of the story resonate. I was invested in our contributors deeply, I cared for them, I admired them – I conveyed this most clearly. While my face and eyes reflected to them their own emotions, I had to keep my own emotions in check so as not to overwhelm them. So yes, these were tricky waters to wade through.
What about the laws pertaining to such cyber fraud in India?
The laws surely need to be in step with sophisticated cyber crime modus operandi. There is too much of a responsibility on the victim. First of all, it is difficult for the police to locate and nab the criminals and when they do, their hands are tied considering the associated sections in the Indian Penal Code. In most cases, it is a bailable offence and the perpetrators are out of police custody in a short time, only to trap more victims. Plus, many frauds are committed by perpetrators abroad and this is where the law makes it even more difficult for criminals to be traced. This is just not supportive enough for victims.

You have been a pioneer in helming women-oriented films. Where do you feel Indian cinema stands when it comes to celebrating women vis-à-vis global films?Advertisement
It is very straightforward for me – as long as half our films or even OTT shows are not about female characters, we cannot claim that it is enough. Whether or not this is done globally, my concern is Indian storytelling. Stories revolving around women have to be consciously and mindfully written, directed and produced. Plus, there needs to be a much larger female presence on screen as well as behind it. When I started out, it was just a handful of women directing films, but the number has not grown the way it should have in over two decades.
As part of your research, did you come across statistics on the percentage of men deceiving women on the pretext of marriage, and vice-versa?
There aren’t enough studies on this subject for statistics to be available. We simply do not know enough. And it is urgent and crucial that more research be done on this by the government as well as private agencies.

We do not get to see your work as much as we would like to. What has kept you away for this long?
The fact is that in movie-making, a director struggles to get projects made. It is a tricky terrain because one has to find funding, which is dependent on the actors attached, which in turn is dependent on whether the script one wants to make finds their fancy. So it is a long journey. That said, I had a series release a year before this one called Hush Hush, and keep in mind one season is close to three films in length! It requires an intimidating amount of work and time. We are receiving some solid appreciation for Wedding.con already, which is exciting. And I’m working on two projects this year.Advertisement
What is the most important thing you learnt while working on Wedding.con?
First of all, for me, that matrimonial fraud happens – at this scale. But also that our own culture enables it in many ways. When the institution of marriage is considered crucial, urgent, and an ultimate goal, especially for women in our society, a kind of fertile ground for exploitation is provided to perpetrators. Which is why this fraud enjoys the kind of success it does. And finally, that our law, the police, even families need to be much more supportive of women as well as men who find themselves in the clutches of perpetrators.",lifestyle
Do zinc-rich foods provide relief from cold and cough? Experts weigh in,"As the weather changes, everyone is prone to colds and coughs. While we have all heard about the benefits of vitamin C for colds, few of us are aware of a secret solution – Zinc! “Zinc is helpful as it can reduce the severity and duration of respiratory tract infections. It plays an important role in preventing the virus from growing in the body. Zinc is also known to boost the immune system and fight infections,” said Mona Narula, a child nutritionist in a post on Instagram.
Taking a cue, we decided to decipher how zinc is useful for us.
Notably, zinc is a vital mineral found in a variety of plant and animal foods. “It plays a pivotal role in supporting various functions of the body like the immune system, wound healing, and maintaining overall health. Numerous studies show that zinc supplements help to shorten the duration and severity of colds and coughs,” said R Selve Abbirami, senior dietician, HCL Healthcare.Advertisement
Role of zinc against these ailments
*Strengthens immune system: Zinc triggers the immune system in the body and supports them to fight against the infection causing colds and coughs.
*Anti-viral properties: Help to stop the replication of viruses and reduce the severity of infections.
*Anti-inflammatory agent: Soothes the sore throat and thereby reduces the inflammation in the respiratory tract.

Sources
Zinc-rich foods to includeAdvertisement
Meat: Lean cuts of beef, pork, and lamb.
Poultry: Chicken and turkey, especially dark meat.
Seafood: Oysters, shrimp, and fish.
Dairy: Milk, cheese, and yogurt.
Nuts and Seeds: Almonds, peanuts, pumpkin seeds.
Legumes: Beans, lentils, chickpeas.
Whole Grains: Oats, quinoa, fortified cereals.
Vegetables: Mushrooms, spinach, and others.
Fruits: While fruits generally have lower zinc content, include a variety for overall health.
Vegetarian sources: Nuts such as almonds, walnuts, and cashews, pumpkin seed legumes such as chickpeas, lentils, and beans, whole grains such as oats, wheat, and quinoa, fortified breakfast cereals, dairy products such as milk, cheese, yogurt, vegetables such as broccoli, cherry tomatoes, fruits such as blueberries.
Non-vegetarian sources: Shell fishes such as Sea Oysters, crab, lobsters, poultry, eggs, and meat such as beef, pork, and lamb.
Points to consider
*Absorption of animal sources of zinc is high compared to plant sources. When consuming zinc-rich foods during a cough and cold, prioritise moderation and diversity in your diet. “Include lean meats, poultry, seafood, dairy, nuts, and seeds. Combine zinc-rich foods with vitamin C sources for enhanced immune support,” said Dr Suresh Kumar Panuganti, lead consultant-paediatric critical care and pediatrics, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad.
*Phytates, a substance found in unprocessed whole grains hinder the absorption of zinc, thereby making it less available for the body to utilise. “Hence, vegetarians should follow some cooking techniques such as soaking them for 5–6 hours to reduce the phytate content and increase the bioavailability of zinc,” said Abbirami.
*Organic acids in fermented foods aid in higher absorption, so always include foods in your diet like buttermilk, yogurt, tempeh, and sauerkraut along with some zinc-rich vegetarian sources, mentioned Abbirami.
*The amount of zinc in the plant sources is directly proportional to the amount of zinc in the soil in which it is cultivated.
*A higher dosage of zinc supplement inhibits the absorption of other minerals, always have a check with healthcare professionals while taking supplements.
*Stay hydrated, choose cooking methods that preserve zinc, and be aware of factors like phytates affecting absorption.Advertisement

5 superfoods for glowing skin in winter,"As winter unfurls its frosty embrace, our skin often bears the brunt of the season’s harsh elements, leading to dryness, dullness, and irritation. In the quest for a luminous complexion amidst the winter chill, the role of superfoods emerges as a potent ally.
Superfoods are like a curated selection of nature’s nutritional powerhouses, and integrating these superfoods into your winter diet can be a transformative elixir for maintaining healthy and radiant skin. From combating dryness to promoting elasticity, superfoods can help you achieve a winter glow that transcends the seasonal blues.
According to Dr Rinky Kapoor, consultant dermatologist, cosmetic dermatologist & dermato-surgeon, The Esthetic Clinics, these foods are rich in essential nutrients, antioxidants, and vitamins that promote overall health, including skin health.Advertisement
“In winter, when the skin is exposed to harsh weather conditions and dry air, these nutrient-dense foods play a crucial role in maintaining skin hydration, reducing inflammation, and supporting collagen production,” she tells indianexpress.com in an interaction.
Maintaining glowing skin can become challenging due to the cold, dry air that can strip the skin of its natural moisture. Incorporating superfoods into your diet can help combat these issues and promote radiant skin, said Dr Kapoor.
1. Avocado
Avocado, rich in healthy fats, vitamin E, and antioxidants, stands as a winter skincare champion. This creamy fruit nourishes and hydrates the skin, combating dryness and flakiness, according to Dr Kapoor.

Including sweet potatoes in your meals can help combat the effects of free radicals, leaving your skin with a healthy and radiant appearance.
3. Fatty Fish
Cold-water fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines are packed with omega-3 fatty acids. These essential fats play a crucial role in maintaining skin health by retaining moisture and supporting a robust skin barrier.Advertisement
Including fatty fish in your winter diet can help combat dryness and inflammation, leaving your skin looking and feeling revitalised, along with maintain its elasticity, according to Dr Kapoor.
4. Blueberries
These berries are loaded with antioxidants that combat free radicals, helping to prevent premature ageing and keeping the skin looking vibrant.
5. Spinach
High in vitamins A and C, as well as iron, spinach supports collagen production and aids in skin repair, making it an excellent choice for winter skincare.

Rajkumar Periasamy: ‘Kamal Haasan sir was the one who thought Sivakarthikeyan would be perfect for Amaran’,"After the blockbuster success of Vikram, which earned more than Rs 400 crore, Kamal Haasan has become active as a producer with more than four films in production. His production company, Raaj Kamal Films International, is bankrolling Sivakarthikeyan’s 21st film titled Amaran. Directed by Rajkumar Periasamy, the film features Sivakarthikeyan in the role of a soldier.
While Haasan is known for ghost directing his films and restraining the freedom of his directors, Amaran director Rajkumar Periasamy has a different story tell. In a recent interview with the Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan, the director praised Haasan for being a great producer. He mentioned that the actor-filmmaker never tried to interfere or micromanage him and gave complete freedom to work on Amaran.

He said, “Kamal sir is a great strength for us. He was the one who thought Sivakarthikeyan would be very suitable for this story. He never visited the sets, neither in Chennai nor in Kashmir. Not even once. He does not call us every day to inquire. He gives the director that much freedom. If there is any problem for us, he will immediately come and help us. If there is any problem with getting schedules, permissions, or anything like that, we will immediately get a call from Kamal sir asking us if he has to do something for us.”
Amaran, also starring Sai Pallavi, Bhuvan Arora, Rahul Bose, Lallu, and Shreekumar, features music by GV Prakash Kumar. The film is based on journalist Shiv Aroor and Rahul Singh’s book India’s Most Fearless. The trailer of the movie showcased Sivakarthikeyan, who has undergone a massive physical transformation, as a beefed-up soldier.

"One song in Rocky Aur Rani cost more than all six episodes of Love Storiyaan combined, Karan Johar was shocked: ‘Iss budget mein film banti hain?’","Karan Johar is so accustomed to working in a certain budget bracket that he was ‘shocked’ to discover how much money Prime Video had allotted Dharmatic for its recent docuseries Love Storiyaan. In an interview, Dharmatic’s Content Head Somen Mishra recalled telling Karan that the entire budget for the six films in the anthology series was lower than what they had for one song in Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani.
In an interview with OTTPlay, he said, “Karan was already shocked by the budget when he told him what we were getting from Amazon. Karan asked, ‘Iss budget mein filmein banti hain (Are films made with this budget)?’ I said, of course. I remember telling someone that the combined budget of all our six films is less than the budget of one song of Rocky Aur Rani KIi Prem Kahaani. Either less than or equal to. I guess, it will be less than. Because Rocky Aur Rani KIi Prem Kahaani has big songs. Big studios, 200-plus people on sets.”

Vikrant Massey says he worked for 110 hours non-stop during TV days: ‘Morning shifts melted into night shifts’,"Following the success of 12th Fail, actor Vikrant Massey has been sweeping away all the awards, his recent feat — Most Promising Actor at Dadasaheb Phalke Awards where the film was honoured with the Best Film (Critics) award. For the Vidhu Vinod Chopra directorial, Vikrant is being showered with all the praises and getting media attention, but the actor doesn’t forget to talk about struggles as an artiste, especially during his initial days on TV. The actor, who started his career with Hindi television, opened up working  110 hours non-stop for a show.
While speaking with Unfiltered by Samdish, Vikrant, who worked on shows like Balika Vadhu, Dharam Veer, Baba Aisa Var Dhoondho etc, recalled television being a competitive space where actors had to work hectic, crazy hours to shoot and complete episodes. “Back in the day, artistes would shoot for 18-20 hours. There came a time when I had to shoot for 110 hours straight without stopping!” he recalled. Following a freak accident of a co-star, the writers reworked the script to use Vikrant as filler in every frame.

The actor, who started his acting career on the small screen at the age of 17, and worked for over a decade, quit the medium when he had a Rs 35 lakh per month contract in hand. He wanted to do  “good work and find peace.”

"Shark Tank India 3: Anupam Mittal refuses to join others in all-shark deal, gets rejected by entrepreneur","The latest episode of Shark Tank India saw all five sharks expressing interest in joining hands with a young entrepreneur, but it didn’t result in an all-shark deal because Anupam Mittal took the solo route. The entrepreneur pitched his DIY meal-kit company Cheflin, and asked for Rs 40 lakh in exchange of 10% equity, which valued the company at Rs 4 crore.
The entrepreneur presented the DIY sushi kit to each shark prior to making his pitch, during which he told them about himself. He said that his family experienced many hardships, with his father’s textile factory being destroyed, and him being scammed for Rs 8 crore. Eventually, he had to declare bankruptcy. But the setbacks didn’t deter the entrepreneur from following his own dreams, which the sharks appreciated.

First, Namita Thapar and Azhar Iqubal made a joint offer for Rs 40 lakh, in exchange of 20% equity. Peyush Bansal seemed apprehensive about the market for DIY meal-kits, but was impressed by the entrepreneur, who’d set up the business by himself, with just Rs 1.5 lakh investment from his family. They also took note of the fact that he holds 100% equity in the company. Amit Jain expressed an interest in investing as well, and after Namita and Azhar egged him on because the entrepreneur needs all the help he can get, he joined them. “We’ll put Rs 10 lakh each, and take 5% each,” Peyush said.

But Anupam was so impressed with the company’s potential that he chose to pitch the entrepreneur about what he can bring to the table. “It’s difficult to put money into this business in its current state. But the lessons you have learned in life, and the creativity you have tell me that you can take it to the next level. You need committed guidance. You’ve seen how I plug products I’ve invested in on Instagram, I do whatever it takes. I dress for them, I wear their glasses, their jewellery. So, here’s my offer to you, Rs 40 lakh for 15%. I’m not greedy. I want you to succeed, I want to be fair, but I also want to make money. Let’s make it a win-win,” he said.
The entrepreneur took a moment to decide, and returned with a counter-offer. He asked if the four sharks could reduce their equity ask to 15%, but Anupam interjected and reduced his ask to 12%. But when the team of four sharks reduced their ask to 16%, the entrepreneur closed the deal.",entertainmaent

However, in a recent interview, actor-producer Vivek Vaswani, who closely worked with SRK during the early years of his career, said that there is no truth to these rumours as Shah Rukh is a “one-woman man” and is devoted to wife Gauri Khan.
In a recent chat with YouTuber Siddharth Kannan, Vivek was asked if he was “ever in a relationship with Shah Rukh?” To this, Vivek immediately said, “You mean sexual relationship? No. He’s not that sort. I don’t know where the rumours came from. We were living in the same house, my parents were there, there was tension, stress about career, he had to get married to Gauri, where would a relationship be in all of this? There was a relationship of friendship.”
He added, “There was no relationship of sex. I would not even be able to think but… Unfortunately, for Shah Rukh because of his relationship with me, because he lived in my house, because of his relationship with Karan, a lot of people have tried to… as you become bigger in stature as a star, as a success, people say all sorts of things. It’s not true.”Advertisement

An Alia fan wondered if the actor had been “replaced” in the new film. “The fact that the name has ki and is directed by Shashank makes me fear they’ve replaced Alia from that franchise.”

"Divya Khossla drops ‘Kumar’ surname amid rumours of divorce from Bhushan Kumar, spokesperson clears the air","Actor-director-producer Divya Khossla, who is married to T-Series chairman and MD Bhushan Kumar, recently dropped ‘Kumar’ from her surname and unfollowed T-Series on Instagram, leading to speculations about their marriage. The production house’s spokesperson has now cleared the air. Zoom TV reports that sources close to the filmmaker’s team have claimed these reports to be false. “No Truth,” added the source. 
The T-Series’ spokesperson cited numerology and Divya’s belief in astrology as the reason behind the change in her name. “Divya Khossla‘s choice to drop her married surname, driven by astrological beliefs, is a personal decision and should be respected, her addition of an ‘s’ to her maiden surname, symbolising her astrological belief is for the same thought,” the spokesperson said. The actor, who will be seen in Hero Heeroine, had previously added an ‘s’ extra to her surname ‘Khosla’. 
The 36-year-old tied the knot with Bhushan in the year 2011, and they have a son together. Divya has acted in films such as Ab Tumhare Hawale Watan Saathiyo, Sanam Re, Satyameva Jayate, and Yaariyan 2, among others. She turned director with Yaariyan, and later helmed Sanam Re.  
While there were speculations that Divya had also unfollowed her husband on social media, it has been found that she continues to follow him.

Kangana Ranaut slams ‘privileged brat’ Twinkle Khanna for comparing men to ‘plastic bags’,"Kangana Ranaut took to Instagram stories and wrote a note criticising actor-turned-author Twinkle Khanna for her recent comments, where she likened men to ‘plastic bags.’ Calling Twinkle a ‘privileged brat’, Kangana questioned her about her apparent inability to find joy and fulfillment in the selflessness of motherhood. She also questioned the meaning of feminism in light of Twinkle’s remarks.
Taking to social media, Kangana wrote, “What are these privileged brats who call their men polythene bags, are they trying to be cool? Nepo kids born with silver spoon, given film careers on golden platters, couldn’t do justice to that for sure, least they could do find some joy and fulfilment in selflessness of motherhood that also seems like a curse in their case what exactly do they want to be? Vegetables? Is that feminism?”

In the video shared by Kangana, Twinkle said, “I do keep saying this. I think we do need men. It’s almost like a handbag. You can carry things in a plastic bag, but its nice to have a kelly. It is pretty much that. Having said that I think it’s equal partnership.” Twinkle said that despite women making progress, 90 percent of the child care and household duties become a woman’s responsibility.

Bramayugam box office day 7: Mammootty’s horror film inches toward Rs 50 crore mark worldwide,"At 72, Mammootty is scripting a great legacy with every new film. The Malayalam superstar has been experimenting and pushing boundaries in recent years. While his rival Mohanlal is failing on that account, Mammootty is consistently delivering acclaimed performances. After the success of Kaathal: The Core, Mammootty’s Bramayugam has also been delivering the goods at the box office. On Day 7, despite being a weekday, the film has managed to collect Rs 1.20 crore, which is only Rs 15 lakhs less than its Day 6 collection.
ALSO READ | Bramayugam: Mammootty’s miraculous run continues with the bleakest Indian horror film in years, a take-no-prisoners tirade against humanity
Domestically, the film has earned Rs 16.95 crore, according to industry tracker Sacnilk. It is expected to cross Rs 20 crore by the weekend. With the positive word-of-mouth, and enthusiastic review, the film is expected to outdo its performances on the weekdays.
By Day 6, the film earned more than Rs 34 crore globally, and the early estimates predict that the film would have crossed the Rs 40 crore mark on Day 7. Analysts predict that the film will eventually earn more than Rs 50 crore by the second weekend.Advertisement
Anandu Suresh of Indian Express rated the film with 3.5 stars and a part of his review read, “Mammootty doesn’t hold back in even the most disturbing scenes in the Rahul Sadasivan film, going all in and extracting the best from himself to elevate the movie.”
Bramayugam, a black and white film, is a spine-chilling horror, based on Aithihyamala, century-old Malayalam tales. In addition to Mammootty, the film has Arjun Ashokan, Sidharth Bharathan, Amalda Liz, and Manikandan R Achari.

Actor Saif Ali Khan has revealed how he and his co-star Ajay Devgn broke the ice and became friends while shooting for the Milan Luthria directorial, which completed 25 years recently. The action-thriller featured Saif and Ajay as two polar opposite half-brothers. In an interview with Zoom, Saif said how the two formed a strong bond, which led to a good on-screen chemistry.

The actor said neither of them spoke for a while on the first day, and were “comfortably quiet,” that is, till Ajay intervened and said, “‘I think we will get along fine.’ And we have gotten along very well.”
Calling Ajay as “amazing”, Saif said he was extremely funny and friendly as he recalled the film’s outdoor shoot. “We spent a lot of time together. Handcuffed on the set and driving around Rajasthan. Sometimes we would be driving for eight hours at a stretch. We were young … We shot long hours and went out for drinks in the jungle after the wrap-up… I honestly feel that kind of thing won’t happen anymore.”Advertisement
Though Saif considers Kachche Dhaage a “special film,” he doesn’t rate his performance in it highly. The actor said he wasn’t good in the film, but the off-set memories–Ajay’s ‘crazy’ stunt of being dragged under a real train, him performing some ‘cool’ jumps–make it one of his most cherished experiences. “I don’t really like myself in Kachche Dhaage… the voice is nasal and thin and I wasn’t grounded as an actor… but it wasn’t too bad,” he added. Kachche Dhaage also starred Manisha Koirala and Namrata Shirodkar.

"Salman Khan behaves like a college bully but with a good heart, is respectful of elders: Vivek Vaswani","Salman Khan was yet to become a superstar after his debut film Maine Pyar Kiya but even in those early days, Salman had a reputation of being “brattish”. In a recent interview, Vivek Vaswani, who put together the 1991 film Patthar Ke Phool starring Salman and Raveena Tandon, recalled how Salman came on board. Vivek said that he wanted to get Salim Khan to write the film and was hoping to raise some money for the film if he could rope in the veteran writer.
Talking to Siddharth Kannan, Vivek recalled, “I had met Salim Khan. Nutan ji coached me and said ‘tell him, it’s not the money. Movies are made with scripts, not money. There was no intention of casting Salman (in Patthar Ke Phool). The intention was that Salim saab will write the script and we’ll be able to cast and we’ll be able to find money. We gave Salim saab Rs 21,000 and he wrote Patthar Ke Phool, which went through many changes later.”
It was around that time that Maine Pyar Kiya was nearing its release and Salim Khan suggested that Salman would suit the lead role here. “He only suggested that we should think about casting Salman. Maine Pyar Kiya was about to release at that time,” he recalled. Vivek was impressed with Salman but since the film was being produced by GP Sippy’s production house and Salim Khan had written films like Sholay and Seeta Aur Geeta for them, he put them in touch with Salman.Advertisement

When asked about Salman’s “brattish” behaviour, which he was notoriously known for in those days, Vivek said that Salman was very respectful of his elders but wasn’t all that nice to people his own age, or those younger to him. “I didn’t have any brattish behaviour from Salman. You know, surprisingly with his elders, he is very respectful. His parents, Helen aunty, his old producers, very respectful. He behaves brattish with his own age or younger. Like the normal college bullies… but not with a bad heart so I didn’t have a bad experience with Salman,” he said.
Salman has been in the movies since 1989. His last release Tiger 3 collected over Rs 285 crore in India.

"‘Intimidating’ Sharmila Tagore didn’t make eye contact, Saif Ali Khan complimented biceps: Kunal Kemmu recalls first meeting with Soha’s family","Actor Kunal Kemmu said that he was rather intimidated in his first meeting with in-laws Sharmila Tagore and Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi. In an interview, Kunal looked back on his love story with wife Soha Ali Khan, and also reflected on his first-ever interaction with her brother, Saif Ali Khan. He said that Saif’s biggest takeaway from their meeting was that he, Kunal, had ‘good biceps’.
Kunal appeared on Raj Shamani’s podcast, where he said that he was watching one of Soha’s films, when he visualised her as his future girlfriend, but thought that she was ‘way out of (his) league’. Asked how his first meetings with Soha’s illustrious family members went, Kunal said in Hindi, “The meetings happened organically, but I was terrified.”
Also read – Kunal Kemmu on navigating loneliness, stress in career: ‘Acting is a tough job, comes with a lot of insecurity’Advertisement
Asked who he was scared to meet the most, the actor continued, “You’re always more nervous to meet the parents, and in her household, everybody is a champion. The first time I met Saif bhai was, we used to go play pool at a friend’s place. Bhai and his friend came together, and we met for the first time while playing pool. And the first thing he noticed about me was, ‘You’ve got good biceps’. I remember he was the coolest person. It was too early for him to ask me what my intentions were, but he just chilled with us. He’s just such a nice person in general, and we’ve spent so much time together, we hardly ever talk about films. He has vivid interests, and he wants to know what your interests are and talk about those.”
Going back to their first meeting over pool, Kunal said that they got ‘pretty competitive’ and the conversation revolved mostly around fitness and travel. He asked Soha if Saif had said anything about him to her, and her response was, “He said you have good biceps.”
But Kunal’s first meeting with Soha’s parents was more nerve-wracking. “The most intimidating was meeting Amma. Dad was also pretty cool, but I was just intimidated anyways, even though he’s pretty sweet. I remember Amma didn’t make eye contact with me for the longest time. Her questions weren’t directed at me. She asked, ‘So, what do you do?’ looking at a magazine. That was the first meeting, in the second meeting I got eye contact, and then we became really cool,” he said.
Soha and Kunal tied the knot in 2015 after dating for a couple of years. In 2017, they welcomed daughter Inaaya Naumi.

"Shah Rukh Khan did not charge a penny for this film, decades into his superstardom: Vivek Vaswani","Shah Rukh Khan became a superstar soon after he started his career in the movies, but decades into his superstardom, SRK agreed to do a film and didn’t even charge any money for it. This was the 2010 film Dulha Mil Gaya, which was produced by his old friend Vivek Vaswani and starred Sushmita Sen and Fardeen Khan in lead roles. In a recent interview, Vivek recalled that he already had already signed Sushmita when she suggested Shah Rukh’s name for the role. Vivek, along with director Mudassar Aziz, took the script to Shah Rukh, who agreed instantly.
In a chat with Siddharth Kannan, Vivek recalled, “Shah Rukh said, ‘Vivek has come for the first time. I will do the film, won’t take any money for it’. He didn’t listen to the script also, and he did the film.” Shah Rukh did not have a major part in the film, but it wasn’t a cameo either. He had a 42-minute role, and Vivek made sure that none of his parts were cut on the edit table. “The truth is that the role was exactly 42 minutes in the script and it was exactly 42 minutes on screen. 42 minutes is not small. He gave us five days and we finished it in five days,” he shared.
Vivek said that Shah Rukh did exactly what the makers wanted him to do and was “brilliant” at it. “Exactly as we wanted, Shah Rukh did it. He didn’t interfere, he didn’t read the script, he was so brilliant, so convincing, he was outstanding, this is the truth,” he said.Advertisement

In the same chat, Vivek recalled Shah Rukh’s remuneration for one of his first films, Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman. SRK famously signed a few films even before his first release, so films like Deewana, Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman, Chamatkar, Dil Aashna Hai were all in the making around the same time. It just so happened that Deewana was released first. “Shah Rukh wanted Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman to be the first release but then, I said if you become a hit, then Raju will be sold at a higher price, and if you become a flop, then Raju will save you. You become successful by strategy, not by luck,” he said.
When asked how much Shah Rukh was paid for Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman, Vivek said, “He took Rs 50,000 for Raju.” But when asked if Shah Rukh would have worked for even Rs 10,000, Vivek said, “Yes. The money was pocket money, he was living in my house. But I would like everyone to be paid professionally and in those days, for a new actor to be paid Rs 50,000 was respectable, it was not small.”
Vivek claims to be instrumental in orchestrating Shah Rukh’s initial releases so he could become a ‘saleable’ actor. He also shared that the two have not spoken in four years.

Bharti Singh says Madhuri Dixit’s son was fanning her on the sets of Karan Johar’s film: ‘I took the fan from his hand’,"Bollywood actor Madhuri Dixit Nene has returned as a judge on the new season of Dance Deewane. Recently on the show, host Bharti Singh shared a story about Madhuri’s son, Arin, and Arbaaz Khan-Malaika Arora’s son, Arhaan, working as assistants on the sets of Karan Johar’s film. Bharti had a cameo in Karan’s Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahani.
Bharti said, “I was doing a film with Karan sir, and your son (Madhuri Dixit’s son) was assisting him. After the cut, Karan sir told him to get chairs. Me and Harsh sat down. Two kids began fanning us and Karan sir came saying, ‘Bharti did you meet them? He is Madhuri ma’am’s son.’ I took the hand fan from him. There was Arbaaz Khan’s son too.”
She continued, “They are superstar’s kids. They can start their work from the top. I myself saw, they were working like they were starting from scratch. I was very proud that time and I was like, ‘You are such good parents. Even I learnt something that day.’”

"Emraan Hashmi says Bollywood suffering from ‘wild perception’ game, takes dig at those who criticise it: ‘They say it’s full of drugs, parties…’","Who needs a good PR? Considering the events in the last few years, it is the Hindi film industry. Actor Emraan Hashmi says Bollywood has been a victim of “skewed negative perception” where those who work in it have painted an untrue picture of its functioning.
The Hindi film industry faced highly coordinated and drummed by negativity on social media few years ago, where it was made to be the breeding ground of all things rotten. Emraan, who plays a producer on his next series Showtime, says Bollywood was at the receiving end of false perceptions.

“There’s a perception, especially in the last three years, which has become very skewed towards an overtly negative perception. That everything that’s wrong (in the society), happens in Bollywood. Drugs, wild parties, promiscuity and everything. I don’t know where did that suddenly come about in the last three years, but it amped up to another level,” Emraan tells Indianexpress.com.Advertisement
The actor says every film industry has a “few bad apples” which bring it a bad name but one will “never hear” that about other industries. “We (Bollywood) have become more of a soft target. Wild perceptions are being put out there and even more so now on social media. Thats far from true. People just like to bash this industry.”

Emraan says the negativity is true even for the nepotism debate, which rings hollow now in the face of mindless trolling and people with agenda to dent the image of the industry.
“There are enough outsiders who have are a success story than the ‘nepo kids’. It’s an industry where both these worlds coexist. It’s a very secular industry, where you have people from all walks of life, of all castes, ideologies, languages. They all come together for the sole purpose to entertain the audience, which is beautiful.
“But sometimes people get the platform to talk about it and the spotlight on them gives them this bit of fame and that’s why they like to do it. There’s no other industry where they’ll critique it and get that level of fame for themselves. So, this industry is a soft target that way,” Emraan adds.
Showtime is created and written by Sumit Roy with Mihir Desai attached as a showrunner. The Disney Plus Hotstar series, directed by Mihir Desai and Archit Kumar and backed by Karan Johar, also stars Rajeev Khandelwal, Mouni Roy, Naseeruddin Shah, Mahima Makwana and Shriya Saran in key roles. It’ll premiere on March 8.

What happens when a Punjabi and a Marxist walk into a bar? Prime Video’s latest series Love Storiyaan unpacks the making of a lover,"Is it possible for a transistor to give birth to a family? It is a question perhaps difficult to visualise but Prime Video’s Valentine’s Day offering, Love Storiyaan, is committed to explore what it means to love, lose and live. The new series presents the earnest answer repeatedly through the course of its six episodes: Yes, it is possible, for where there is a will, there is a way; and where there is a way, lovers will always find their way home.
Conceptualized by Somen Mishra and backed by Karan Johar’s Dharmatic Entertainment, the series is based on stories on India Love Project, founded by former journalists Priya Ramani, Samar Halarnkar, and Niloufer Venkatraman. On a purely surface level of content available for one to stream, the series operates as a timeline cleanser in the crime-soaked fabric of OTT. What truly makes Love Storiyaan culturally the timeliest series to be streaming currently is how it puts spotlight on six real life couples, loving against all odds.
Also Read | Love Storiyaan review: Karan Johar’s web series celebrates the joys of real-life romantic diversity
The episodes feature broken people, failed marriages, lovers torn apart by violence, lovers grappling with addiction and the real possibility of love eventually fizzling out. Lovers can find their way home, sure, but where do we find lovers to begin with?Advertisement
Episode after episode, Love Storiyaan examines–and questions– who exactly a ‘good lover’ is, if such a concept exists anyway. Can an alcoholic, notorious as a flirt in his community, who is coming off a failed marriage make for a wonderful partner to another woman? Can a mother of two have an affair over the internet? Can a rich, spoilt boy, interested only in the college notes of a girl, cross borders and rebel against family? Can an idealistic activist love like a hopeless romantic? Can a lover blossom in the shadow of a gun? Can one, who was never truly seen, make the other visible?

What Love Storiyaan manages to do is a triumph in the age of increasingly piercing gaze of the internet, where every ‘unconventional’ relationship–or at least the circumstances around it– is quickly given a label. The nauseating and deeply myopic idea of painting people, and sometimes complex birth of their relationships, as ‘red flags’ is turned on its head on the show, especially in the segments helmed by Hardik Mehta (An Unsuitable Girl), Vivek Soni (Love on Air), Akshay Indikar (Raah Sangharsh Ki) and Collin D’Cunha (Love Beyond Labels).
If some of the lovers in Love Storiyaan were simply anonymous Twitter users detailing the initial phase of their relationship or the magnetic pull of getting drawn to a person, who doesn’t tick every single box of being a ‘green-flag’, they would have been trolled and their equation judged. Can a Brahmin truly fall for a Dalit or is it a saviour complex? Can a known flirt really be loyal? Can a man from a conservative country be with a woman with agency? Love Storiyaan neatly unpacks these questions as it presents answer with a simplistic love eventually wins narrative, told through the lives of lovers who lose a lot yet keep at it.

Love Storiyaan’s biggest win comes in the ensemble of its directors. There is everything for everyone, love packaged in different forms of movie making. If Hardik Mehta and Vivek Soni deliver the show’s most commercial mini movies– laced with moments of genuine charm, wit and a beating heart–Akshay Indikar presents a stunning blend of documentary-like filmmaking with touches of grand cinematic staging. His docu soars whenever it stays with the subjects, letting them be, rather than getting overwhelmed with the setting.
If Collin D’Cunha packs an assured, sensitively told and intimately shot segment with a flair of a filmmaker who knows how to build a sweeping tale, Archana Phadke with her segment Faasley pieces archival footages of a country in turmoil to give viewers a more inwards reflection of the discomfort of a distance.Advertisement

But the best short of the show is by Shazia Iqbal, a filmmaker in remarkable form in her segment Homecoming. The episode, about two lovers settled in India revisiting their native country Bangladesh, from where they had to be uprooted for the sake of their love, powers through with cinematic excellence.
Co-directed by Rahul Badwelkar, Homecoming is the series’ Veer Zara– about lovers meeting and waiting, crossing borders, revisiting their past and imagining their future. It is humane, sharply political and deeply romantic. What also works in Homecoming is the minimal use of re-enactments, as Shazia lets the focus constantly be on the couple. When she does use actors to give a glimpse of how the couple could have been in their past, it leads to a rousing, musical climax straight out of a big screen Hindi film.
It may not all add up entirely, and some bits may fall short of expectations, but Love Storiyaan rides on the ambition to love in the times of hate, to commit in the era of ghosting. There is history and chemistry, it is personal and political. What’s not to like in a series which asks a simple question- What happens when a Punjabi and a Marxist walk into a bar? Of course, you know it by now. They fall in love.

Einstein and the Bomb movie review: A poor attempt by Netflix to piggyback on the popularity of Oppenheimer,"With the production values of a hastily made Saturday Night Live sketch and all the visual splendour of a Sora video, Netflix’s Einstein and the Bomb fails — in every possible way — to provide any actual insight about the renowned theoretical physicist. Charitably speaking, the hour-long docudrama is a blatant attempt to piggyback on the popularity of Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, without bothering to match the blockbuster film’s ambition or complexity in a meaningful manner.
Einstein and the Bomb combines extensive dramatic reenactments and a smattering of archival footage, but with zero expert input. The film begins with the claim that every word in it was either spoken or written by Einstein himself. Everything that we see is supposedly hard fact. It’s fairly reasonable, therefore, for the viewer to expect the film to uncover interesting details about his life and personality, especially since so much of it has been documented. But some of the creative choices here, regardless of the resources available, are simply bizarre to behold.

Einstein and the Bomb traces Einstein’s journey as a political refugee in England to his stint at Princeton University in the United States. This is when he crossed paths with J Robert Oppenheimer (in a made-up scene) in Nolan’s film. You’d perhaps be a little dismayed to learn that Oppenheimer doesn’t make an appearance in Einstein and the Bomb at all. In fact, he isn’t even mentioned. The movie does, however, address Einstein’s tangential role in the creation of the world’s first atomic bombs, as well as the guilt that he was subsequently tortured by in the days following America’s bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The problem is that it doesn’t view this as incidental complicity, but as an innocent mistake.
Aidan McArdle plays Einstein in the reenactments, although director Anthony Philipson seems to be under the impression that makeup is more important than an actor’s performance. In virtually every frame, McArdle looks like he’s wearing an Albert Einstein mask — not the plastic kind you’d get at a toy shop, but the sort of mask that Buffalo Bill carves from the skin of his victims in Silence of the Lambs. It’s massively distracting, as if the stilted dialogue wasn’t already damaging the film.

The first 30-odd minutes of the movie are devoted entirely to Einstein’s ouster from Germany, where his vocal opposition of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party painted a target on his back. Einstein fled to England, where, like Taylor Swift during the pandemic, he fully embraced a cottagecore aesthetic and lived in the countryside with two armed female guards for company. In the film, he spends this time regaling his companions about relativity — “an hour sitting on the park bench with a pretty girl feels like a minute, and a minute sitting on a hot stove feels like an hour” — and also contemplating the potentially dangerous implications of his theories.
Einstein describes himself as a ‘militant pacifist’. “Organised force,” he says, “can only be opposed by organised force.” And this is why he co-signed a letter addressed to the then-US President Franklin D Roosevelt, urging him to initiate a nuclear programme before the Nazis beat everybody to it. This was perhaps his biggest contribution to the creation of the atomic bombs; Einstein wasn’t invited to join the Manhattan Project owing to his vocal politics. But the film doesn’t exactly indict the Americans for what is generally considered to be a war crime, although, admittedly, Einstein and the Bomb underlines the fact that the Americans attacked Japan after it was already clear that the war had been won.Advertisement
Speaking of pure evil, the film also recreates a speech that Einstein made at the Royal Albert Hall in 1933, denouncing Hitler’s rise in the clearest of terms. Real footage of this speech exists, but Einstein and the Bomb chooses to use only about six seconds of it, as if it is actively trying to stay within the parameters of the fair use policy. To find a way around this invented obstacle — remember, it was probably impossible for Einstein and the Bomb to recreate the entire speech in a packed hall — the filmmakers take us backstage, where they take the ‘jugaadu’ approach by showing us Einstein’s nervous rehearsals.

A part of you can’t help but admire problem-solving such as this. But then again, this isn’t a student film, or one of those informative videos that play on a loop at museums, projected against an empty wall. It’s a proper movie that Netflix has deemed worthy of a prominent spot on its already overpopulated homepage. This is prime real estate, the sort of spot that would typically be assigned to an actual Nolan film, as opposed to something that is merely riding on the coattails of one.

Express At Berlinale: Scorsese’s resurrection of Powel and Pressburger,"In her soft salmon pink silk shirt, her eyes twinkling, as she says, “oh, you’re from India”, Thelma Schoonmaker looks more like a genial grandma presiding over a tea-table, rather than the razor sharp, multiple Oscar-winning film editor that she is.
She’s here at the 74th Berlinale, speaking about the abiding influence the films of Powell and Pressburger had on Martin Scorsese, who received the Golden Bear award for Lifetime Achievement . If Scorsese is considered a legend, with a body of work that has stood the test of time, Schoonmaker, the editor of his films, is no less so. She got to know Michael Powell through Scorsese, and went on to marry the former, so who better to shine a light on their relationship than her?
As a child, says Scorsese in the two-hour long documentary, ‘Made In England : The Films Of Powell And Pressburger’, he was an asthmatic so he couldn’t go out and play. Confined to his chair, and the TV set in the living room, his first encounter with these films was nothing short of magic. Hollywood films were not available on TV, but British films were, and somewhere during those endless repeats of The Red Shoes, The Life And Death Of Colonel Blimp, Black Narcissus and others, the young Scorsese knew what he was going to be when he grew up.Advertisement
“Marty was born to be a filmmaker”, says Schoonmaker, “and the Powell-Pressburger films showed him the way. He loved them because there were no heroes, or villains in their films, just people like us”. The best part about the documentary, apart from Scorsese’s carefully-crafted narration, are the clips from the Powell and Pressburger pantheon, as well as from Scorsese’s films : for those who haven’t watched any of their movies, those snippets are a real treat.
During the 30s and 40s, the very British Michael Powell and the Hungarian Emeric Pressburger thrived, and their films, under their banner of The Archers, found eager viewers flocking into theatres. During World War 2 and after, they hit a low, and quite astonishingly soon, they were forgotten. It is only when Scorsese came looking for them sometime in the 70s, and made his admiration for the duo well known, that interest in their films was rekindled.
“No one knew who they were before Marty resurrected them”, says Schoonmaker. “In his autobiography, Michael (Powell passed away in 1990) said that after meeting Scorsese and basking in the evident warmth of his regard, ‘the blood started flowing in his veins again’”. Powell was the more forceful of the two, Pressburger was quieter, but both worked really well, picking on each other’s strengths.
The films, and their makers, reached cult status shortly after, and since then there have been several retrospectives of their work, something that Schoonmaker, and David Hinton, the director of Made In England are thrilled about. Scorsese called them the only independent-minded directors who managed to make their kind of films while staying within the system, and you can see what he means when we see clips of their films-within-the-film which celebrates their work. It is a quality that Scorsese, and other directors who blossomed in the 70s — Steven Spielberg, Brian DePalma, among others — wanted to incorporate in their own work.Advertisement
I ask Schoonmaker about her process of collaborating with Scorsese. Are there any disagreements? “No, not really”, she said, “We screen quite a few times, more than most people in the business, and Marty listens to what I have to say. I have the greatest job in the world”. She does bring up the instance of Raging Bull, arguably Robert De Niro’s greatest role, “where we had shot several scenes, and I wanted to go with warmer scenes but Marty wanted him to be colder. And he was right”, she laughs. “It is the film I learnt the most from him.”",entertainmaent

"Sam Mendes to helm four Beatles biopics; Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr get a movie each","The Beatles are getting the big-screen biopic treatment in not just one film, but a Fab Four of movies that will give each band member their own spotlight — all of which are to be directed by Sam Mendes.
For the first time, The Beatles, long among the stingiest rights granters, are giving full life and music rights to a movie project. Sony Pictures announced Monday a deal that may dwarf all music biopics that have come before it, with the stories of Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr spread out over a quartet of films.
The films, conceived by Sam Mendes, are expected to roll out theatrically in innovative fashion, with the movies potentially coexisting or intersecting in theaters. Precise release plans will be announced at a later date. Sony is targeting 2027 for their release.Advertisement
Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and the families of John Lennon and George Harrison have all signed off on the project through the band’s Apple Corps. Ltd. Sony Music Publishing controls the rights to the majority of Beatles songs.
“I’m honored to be telling the story of the greatest rock band of all time, and excited to challenge the notion of what constitutes a trip to the movies,” Mendes said in a statement.
Each film will be from the perspective of a Beatle.
“We intend this to be a uniquely thrilling, and epic cinematic experience: four films, told from four different perspectives which tell a single story about the most celebrated band of all time,” said producer Pippa Harris. “To have The Beatles’ and Apple Corps’ blessing to do this is an immense privilege.”Advertisement
Listen to the last Beatles’ song with John, Paul, George, Ringo and AI tech
The Beatles’ most famous forays into film were in their early years. Between 1964 and 1970, they appeared in five movies, including A Hard Day’s Night (1964) and the animated Yellow Submarine (1968). They’ve, of course, been the subject of many documentaries, most recently Peter Jackson’s 2021 The Beatles: Get Back.
In 2023, the Beatles reunited with the aid of artificial intelligence in the newly released song “Now and Then”. The recording was made possible by technology used by Jackson on Get Back, and featured a music video made by the New Zealand director.
Attempts to dramatize the Beatles’ story have been more sporadic and less impactful. A 1979 biopic, made when Lennon was still alive, called The Birth of the Beatles was produced with Beatles original drummer Pete Best as an adviser. The 1994 indie drama Backbeat chronicled Lennon’s relationship with Stuart Sutcliffe before the Beatles were famous. Nowhere Boy (2009) starred Aaron Taylor-Johnson as a teenage Lennon.Advertisement
But in the last decade, music biopics have become big business. Box-office hits like Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocketman and Elvis have sent Hollywood executives chasing the next jukebox blockbuster. Over Presidents Day weekend, Bob Marley: One Love, produced with the Marley estate, was the No. 1 movie in theaters. A Michael Jackson biopic is in production.

“Theatrical movie events today must be culturally seismic. Sam’s daring, large-scale idea is that and then some,” said Tom Rothman, chair and chief executive of Sony Pictures’ Motion Picture Group.
The combination of Sam Mendes’ team “with the music and the stories of four young men who changed the world, will rock audiences all over the globe,” Rothman said. “We are deeply grateful to all parties and look forward ourselves to breaking some rules with Sam’s uniquely artistic vision.”

"Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan had three wedding ceremonies, recalls Vivek Vaswani: ‘Hindu, Muslim and registered wedding’","Shah Rukh Khan was still a newbie when producer Vivek Vaswani made it his mission to launch Shah Rukh strategically. The two developed a strong friendship so when SRK got married to the love of his life Gauri Khan in 1991, Vivek was one of the guests. In a recent interview, Vivek recalled attending Shah Rukh’s wedding and shared anecdotes from the time.
Talking to Siddharth Kannan, Vivek said that at the time of Shah Rukh’s wedding, the actor was still living with him at his parents’ house. As a wedding gift, Vivek gifted the newlyweds a five-day stay at a hotel in Mumbai and after that, they moved to an apartment which was owned by filmmaker Aziz Mirza. “After the wedding, we took Gauri to Darjeeling because we had to shoot the title song of Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman. When they returned to Bombay, of course, they couldn’t stay at my house so as a gift, I gave them five days at Sun n Sand, then they moved to Aziz’s house,” he recalled and mentioned that he had to borrow money from his father for this gift.
When asked about his memories from the wedding, Vivek Vaswani said that the “food was great”. “It was a fabulous wedding, everything was very nice. It was so much fun,” he said and recalled that Aziz Mirza was in attendance as well. Vivek shared that Shah Rukh’s childhood friends and Gauri’s brother were in such “high spirits” and enjoyed the wedding but since he doesn’t drink, he just soaked in all the fun from the sidelines. Vivek also said that the couple got married as per Hindu and Muslim traditions and also got a registered wedding. “All three weddings happened in one day,” he shared.Advertisement

Talking about Gauri, Vivek said that they never interacted much but he always found her to be a “warm and cordial” person. He also spoke about meeting Gauri socially and said that she has always been nice to him.
Vivek Vaswani helped Shah Rukh Khan in the early days of his career but likes to maintain that he is not the reason for Shah Rukh’s success but only a vessel who helped him get to his destination.

Their wedding was a star-studded affair with celebrities like Varun Dhawan, Arjun Kapoor, Bhumi Pednekar, Esha Deol, David Dhawan, Ayushmann Khurrana, and others in attendance.Advertisement
On Tuesday, Rakul’s parents, Rajendra Singh and Kulwinder Singh, were seen thanking the paparazzi for traveling all the way from Mumbai to Goa to be part of their joyous occasion. They had also announced that the couple would step out to meet the photographers and the media after the wedding ceremony. 
Rakul Preet and Jackky Bhagnani were neighbors and shared several mutual friends. However, their relationship blossomed during the Covid lockdown. The two made their relationship Instagram official in 2021 when Jackky wished Rakul on her birthday with a heartfelt message, expressing his love and admiration for her. Rakul reciprocated with an equally affectionate birthday wish for Jackky later that year. Since then, the couple has shared numerous moments together, attending birthdays, dinners, parties, and various social gatherings.
In her interview with Cosmopolitan, Rakul revealed their perspective on maintaining a healthy relationship. She emphasised that while there’s no specific ‘mantra’ for success, it’s essential to be complete within oneself before entering a relationship. She said, “Being complete in yourself first to be able to complete someone else. And that’s something that both Jackky [Bhagnani] and I have spoken about.”

The actor continued, “Even before we started dating, we spoke about it—the understanding that you know of your shortcomings and work on your relationship with absolutely no insecurities. If one of the partners is insecure, the relationship cannot be healthy. And it boils down to being complete in yourself as a person to be able to be more giving in a relationship.”

Rajeev Khandelwal says Anurag Kashyap had to ‘run from pillar to post’ to make Aamir: ‘They said we’re fine with newcomer but TV actor…’,"Rajeev Khandelwal became a household name when he appeared in the television show Kahiin To Hoga. However, despite gaining immense success on television, producers did not have enough confidence in Rajeev when it came to back his debut film Aamir. In a recent interview, Rajeev recalled that it was Anurag Kashyap, who was one of the producers of the film, who had immense faith in Rajeev but he had to run from pillar to post to get a studio to back the film.
Rajeev was talking about the changing perception of actors who migrate from television to films and how, more than the audience, it is perhaps the makers, who have to show faith in the actor’s capability. The actor shared that producers were ready to invest in the film with a newcomer but they did not want a television actor associated with the film. “When I was doing Aamir, Anurag Kashyap told me later that went to so many producers and my character on television was very very popular. He said, ‘I went from pillar to post and I said I have Rajeev Khandelwal here, who is very popular and they said we don’t want popular… even if you take a newcomer, it’s fine with us but TV actor, maybe no,'” he shared with Showsha.
But Anurag Kashyap did not change the actor and stuck to his guns. He ultimately met Vikas Bahl, who was then working in UTV, and they put the film together. “Anurag had that conviction. He finally met Vikas Bahl from UTV. I was told later that Vikas asked Anurag,’Why do you want Rajeev? Is it because the budget is less?’ They thought that the budget is less that’s why they are casting a TV actor. Both of them said that we both believed in Rajeev and when both of them believed in Rajeev, it happened,” he recalled.Advertisement

Rajeev Khandelwal said that producers have to give the opportunity to an actor for them to flourish and it is them who need to let go of their preconceived notions. He shared, “Sometimes it is difficult to convince the makers to give you the opportunity where you can showcase the world that probably I am much more than how you look at me. That is more difficult than the audience’s acceptance.”
Rajeev’s debut film Aamir (2008), directed by Raj Kumar Gupta, was lauded by critics. The actor will next be seen in the Disney Plus Hotstar web series Showtime.

Manjummel Boys: Soubin Shahir was tensed hearing real-life stories of people stuck in Guna Cave,"Actor-producer Soubin Shahir is gearing up for the release of Manjummel Boys. The film is based on the real-life story of a bunch of friends getting lost in Guna Cave in Kodaikanal. In a recent interview, Soubin revealed that he was tense learning the real-life experiences of the people who were stuck at Guna Cave.
Soubin and the team first made a documentary featuring the friends who were stuck in the cave. They documented the experiences of each individual, and Soubin noted how their accounts were different from each other. Soubin told Film Companion, “It’s very interesting in the sense that we made a documentary about the real survivors, where one person would tell their version and we cut to the next person sharing their experience, which would be different in some way.”
The actor was also worried whether they will be able to emulate the reality and do justice to it.Advertisement

Soubin Shahir revealed that some of the details given by the survivors were deeply affecting. “They recalled some disturbing details and events, which got me tensed not only as the producer but also as the actor who plays an important role. I used to call the real people who faced this issue to get to know their input at all stages. I would also meet them in person and honestly, I was scared thinking about how we would pull this off. We kept in touch with them to maintain that sense of truth.”
The makers are yet to show the final product to the survivors. They are keeping it as a surprise till February 22, when the film will hit screens. Soubin wants the movie to justify their real-life experience, and that’s the reason he doesn’t want to show it to them now.

Berlinale honoree Martin Scorsese ponders switch from gangsters to Jesus,"Martin Scorsese, in Berlin to receive a lifetime achievement award from the city’s film festival weeks before his latest movie, Killers of the Flower Moon, will be competing at the Oscars with 10 nominations, is already planning his next project.
The director, who as a young man considered a priestly vocation before becoming cinema’s most famous maker of gangster movies, said that after some meetings with Pope Francis he was mulling ways of making a film on Jesus, although the project’s contours were not yet clear.
“(The Pope) called at one point at a meeting for fresher ways of thinking about the essentials of Christianity,” the 81-year-old filmmaker told a news conference. “I want to make something unique and different that could be thought-provoking.”Advertisement
Such a project would be his second look at the foundations of Christianity after 1988’s The Last Temptation of Christ, which emphasised the human frailty of Jesus and was banned in some countries and brought Scorsese death threats.

The Berlinale’s Honorary Golden Bear was intended partly to honour Martin Scorsese’s work preserving old films for posterity, said Rainer Rother of the German Cinemathek. The preservation project has been driven by him and fellow directors/screenwriters Steven Spielberg, Paul Schrader and Jay Cocks since the 1970s.
“It was a great difficulty finding good copies of films,” Scorsese recalled, describing how pre-war films were often too damaged to be played in the 1970s, and that only British and a small subset of French and Italian films were easily available to his group of enthusiastic New Yorkers in that era.
“But now you have 100 years of cinema,” he said. “You have films from the 1930s… You have everything from the 1950s. You have it from all the other countries in the world.”Advertisement
Current favorites for him include some Japanese cinema, Celine Song’s Past Lives, and Wim Wenders’ Perfect Days, he said.
Looking forward after six decades in the business, Martin Scorsese said cinema was resilient enough to cope with technological change.
“I don’t think it’s dying… It’s transforming,” he said. “The individual voice can express itself on TikTok or in a four-hour film or a two-hour miniseries… I don’t think we should let the technology scare us.”

For Scorsese personally, it was important to make good use of the time he has left, he added wistfully.
“I became very sad to realize, of course, the impermanence of life, as we all know, but does it have to be that impermanent so soon?” he asked. “In the meantime, we’re all here. We’re all here. So let’s communicate. Let’s communicate through art.”

Welcome to the Hotel California case: The trial over handwritten lyrics to an Eagles classic,"In the mid-1970s, the Eagles were working on a spooky, cryptic new song. On a lined yellow pad, Don Henley, with input from band co-founder Glenn Frey, jotted thoughts about “a dark desert highway” and “a lovely place” with a luxurious surface and ominous undertones. And something on ice, perhaps caviar or Taittinger — or pink Champagne?
The song, “Hotel California,” became one of rock’s most indelible singles. And nearly a half-century later, those handwritten pages of lyrics-in-the-making have become the center of an unusual criminal trial set to open Wednesday.
Rare-book dealer Glenn Horowitz, former Rock & Roll Hall of Fame curator Craig Inciardi and memorabilia seller Edward Kosinski are charged with conspiring to own and try to sell manuscripts of “Hotel California” and other Eagles hits without the right to do so.Advertisement
The three have pleaded not guilty, and their lawyers have said the men committed no crime with the papers, which they acquired via a writer who’d worked with the Eagles. But the Manhattan district attorney’s office says the defendants connived to obscure the documents’ disputed ownership, despite knowing that Henley said the pages were stolen.
Clashes over valuable collectibles abound, but criminal trials like this are rare. Many fights are resolved in private, in lawsuits or with agreements to return the items.
“If you can avoid a prosecution by handing over the thing, most people just hand it over,” said Travis McDade, a University of Illinois law professor who studies rare document disputes.
Of course, the case of the Eagles manuscripts is distinctive in other ways, too.Advertisement
The prosecutors’ star witness is indeed that: Henley is expected to testify between Eagles tour stops. The non-jury trial could offer a peek into the band’s creative process and life in the fast lane of ‘70s stardom.

At issue are over 80 pages of draft lyrics from the blockbuster 1976 Hotel California album, including words to the chart-topping, Grammy-winning title cut. It features one of classic rock’s most recognizable riffs, best-known solos and most oft-quoted — arguably overquoted — lines: “You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.”
Henley has said the song is about “the dark underbelly of the American dream”.
It still was streamed over 220 million times and got 136,000 radio spins last year in the U.S. alone, according to the entertainment data company Luminate. The Hotel California album has sold 26 million copies nationwide over the years, bested only by an Eagles’ greatest hits disc and Michael Jackson’s Thriller.Advertisement
The pages also include lyrics from songs including “Life in the Fast Lane” and “New Kid in Town”. Eagles manager Irving Azoff has called the documents “irreplaceable pieces of musical history”.
Horowitz, Inciardi and Kosinki are charged with conspiracy to possess stolen property and various other offenses.
They’re not charged with actually stealing documents. Nor is anyone else, but prosecutors will still have to establish that the documents were stolen. The defense maintains that’s not true.
Much turns on the Eagles’ interactions with Ed Sanders, a writer who also co-founded the 1960s counterculture rock band the Fugs. He worked in the late ‘70s and early ’80s on an authorized Eagles biography that was never published.Advertisement
Sanders isn’t charged in the case. A phone message seeking comment was left for him. He sold the pages to Horowitz, who then sold them to Inciardi and Kosinski.
Horowitz has handled huge rare book and archive deals, and he’s been entangled in some ownership spats before. One involved papers linked to Gone With the Wind author Margaret Mitchell. It was settled.
Inciardi worked on notable exhibitions for the Cleveland-based Rock Hall of Fame. Kosinski has been a principal in Gotta Have It! Collectibles, known for auctioning celebrities’ personal possessions — so personal that Madonna unsuccessfully sued to try to stop a sale that included her latex briefs.
Henley told a grand jury he never gave the biographer the lyrics, according to court filings from Kosinski’s lawyers. But defense lawyers have signaled that they plan to probe Henley’s memory of the time.Advertisement
“We believe that Mr. Henley voluntarily provided the lyrics to Mr. Sanders,” attorney Scott Edelman said in court last week.
Sanders told Horowitz in 2005 that while working on the Eagles book, he was sent whatever papers he wanted from Henley’s home in Malibu, California, according to the indictment.
Then Kosinski’s business offered some pages at auction in 2012. Henley’s attorneys came knocking. And Horowitz, Inciardi and Sanders, in varying combinations, began batting around alternate versions of the manuscripts’ provenance, the indictment says.
In one story, Sanders found the pages discarded in a backstage dressing room. In others, he got them from a stage assistant or while amassing “a lot of material related to the Eagles from different people”. In yet another, he obtained them from Frey — an account that “would make this go away once and for all,” Horowitz suggested in 2017. Frey had died the year before.Advertisement
“He merely needs gentle handling and reassurance that he’s not going to the can,” Horowitz emailed Inciardi during a 2012 exchange about getting Sanders’ “‘explanation’ shaped into a communication” to auctioneers, the indictment says.
Sanders supplied or signed off on some of the varying explanations, according to the indictment, and it’s unclear what he may have conveyed verbally. But he apparently rejected at least the dressing-room tale.
Kosinki forwarded one explanation, approved by Sanders, to Henley’s lawyer. Kosinski also assured Sotheby’s auction house that the musician had “no claim” to the documents and asked to keep potential bidders in the dark about Henley’s complaints, the indictment says.
Sotheby’s listed the “Hotel California” song lyrics in a 2016 auction but withdrew them after learning the ownership was in question. Sotheby’s isn’t charged in the case and declined to comment.Advertisement
Henley bought some draft lyrics privately from Gotta Have It! for $8,500 in 2012, when he also began filing police reports, according to court filings.
Defense lawyers claim Henley found starstruck prosecutors to take up his cause instead of pursuing a civil suit himself.
Indian Express Entertainment is now on WhatsApp Channels. Follow us for the latest news, interviews, reviews, photos and more.
The DA’s office worked closely with Henley’s legal team, and an investigator even yearned for backstage passes for an Eagles show — until a prosecutor said the idea was “completely inappropriate,” Kosinki’s lawyers said in court papers.Advertisement
Prosecutors have rebuffed questions about their motivations as “a conspiracy theory rather than a legal defense.”

"Aditya Dhar reacts to Uri The Surgical Strike being called an ‘agenda-driven’ film, says Article 370’s intent is ‘pure’: ‘It champions women empowerment’","After the success of Vicky Kaushal’s military drama Uri: The Surgical Strike, which marked his directorial debut, Aditya Dhar says his production venture Article 370 is a film that champions women’s empowerment as the movie is headlined by his wife and actor Yami Gautam and Priyamani, and is based on a “pure story”.
In this interview with indianexpress.com, Dhar also addresses the flak that his debut film Uri: The Surgical Strike received from critics who called it ‘an agenda-driven film filled with jingoism’. The filmmaker said he doesn’t pay heed to this “community of critics” who form judgement on a film instead of reviewing it.
Talking about Article 370, Aditya Dhar shared that the film is based on the truth and “actually shows” what happened when the government initiated the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution in Jammu and Kashmir. He also urged the audience to watch the film as it champions female empowerment.Advertisement
He said, “Article 370 chronologically tells the truth, what had happened and how it happened. There is no jingoism. There is nothing in the film which will feel distasteful. It is a pure story of how these people pulled off such a massive operation. It is a great story. People who always say that we don’t make big female-oriented films in India, we have made it, now go and watch it. This is the film that actually proves that it doesn’t matter if the lead is a guy or a girl; what matters is a great story. Article 370 is the perfect film to be endorsed by people who champion women’s rights.”

Dhar, even after the success of his first film Uri: The Surgical Strike in 2019, which also won the National Award, faced severe criticism from a section of film critics and audiences. He says people called the film “agenda-driven” and “jingoistic”, but the masses proved them wrong.
He said, “The community who feels that it is an agenda-driven film without watching it, I really don’t care about them because I think they are people who have already made their judgement and the agenda is actually in their head. They made a judgement without actually even seeing the film, so I can’t do anything about that. So, even discussing or thinking about them is a waste of time.”
“My point is that I have made a great film with a genuine story and great intent. The audience will hopefully love it and those who don’t want to see it, I can’t force them to see it. If people have already formed their opinions, it doesn’t matter to me. I don’t even think about those people at all because it is a film which will resonate with the audience,” he added.Advertisement
Talking about the flak that Uri received, Aditya Dhar said, “The audience is very intelligent. They understand the difference between an agenda-driven film and a film made with great intent. They also understand the difference between a project and a film. I remember many people trashed Uri at that time, but the audience basically shut them up with the way it went on. The fact is that nothing can be above the audience.”
Dhar also revealed that many people demotivated him from making a war film and told his co-producer Ronnie Screwvala not to make Uri as it would turn out to be a flop. He shared, “When people say that a certain genre doesn’t work in India, I really like it, because people said that about Uri also. I was told war films in India don’t work. They said, ‘After Border in 1997, Lakshya and LOC came, but none of those films made any money, so don’t make.’ Many people told Ronnie (Screwvala) not to make this film because it will flop. But I really enjoy taking it up as a challenge. The moment Uri came out, suddenly there was a spate of war films, army films. It’s much more fun to create a new genre rather than following the herd, like ‘arre aaj kal market mein romantic comedy chal rahi hai, action film chal rahi hai, aap bhi bana do (nowadays romantic comedies and action films are working so make one of those).’ That for me is not exciting. Creating a new trend excites me.”
Also Read | Yami Gautam on Article 370: ‘No point in justifying film to people with preconceived notions’
After making a political drama post the success of Uri, which was a military actioner, Dhar says he is now open to making films in different genres. In fact, his line-up is filled with genre-breaking films. He shared, “I want to make everything. My next film, in all probability, is going to be Dhoom Dhaam, which is a brilliant action comedy. It is genuinely a funny film. The third film coming out after that is Baramulla, which is a horror film, a paranormal thriller. It is an absolutely new genre that has never been done in India before. It is an investigative paranormal thriller action film.”Advertisement
“So, my intent has been that whatever project we are doing, like say with Uri, it was an army action film, this (Article 370) is a political drama, the next one is a comedy action thriller, the third one is a paranormal psychological thriller, every film has to offer something absolutely new,” he concluded.

"Sunil Grover on reuniting with Kapil Sharma after their bitter rift: ‘I would get disturbed, but not anymore’","Actor Sunil Grover has had a very interesting journey to stardom — from exploring theatre to doing TV and eventually  venturing into films. The year 2023 saw him becoming a part of Shah Rukh Khan’s Jawan, and his patch-up with Kapil Sharma after the two had a bitter falling out in 2017.
The two buried the rift professionally and will be coming together for a show on Netflix. While it is said to be a comedy show, not much is known about it. So far, what is clear is that Kapil will be joined by his team from The Kapil Sharma Show. In an interview with Indianexpress.com, Sunil recently opened up about his patch-up with Kapil Sharma.

Revisiting how he dealt with questions about Kapil and their infamous fight, and its press coverage, Sunil said, “Initially, I would get disturbed, but not anymore. I know the truth so what someone says or understands, is their problem, not mine. Those who point fingers, what is their credibility? If I need to answer something, I will do so, but usually there is no need for an explanation. They don’t have a full understanding of the matter, no facts, they are just saying something because it’s their job. Writing negative things grabs more attention. They will all understand eventually.”Advertisement

Poonam Sinha thought Shatrughan Sinha was unhappy with daughter Sonakshi’s birth: ‘Pura filmy scene ho gaya’,"Shatrughan Sinha doesn’t believe in mincing his words, whether it is media interviews or filter-free conversations with colleagues. Every time the actor speaks on a public forum, he opens up a box of memories, takes everyone on a trip down memory lane, shares anecdotes and interesting stories of his co-stars from the ‘70s and ‘80s, and never fails to captivate his audience.
Recently while speaking at Sahitya AajTak 2024, reminiscing the time his daughter Sonakshi Sinha was born, he revealed that his wife Poonam felt the actor was upset after a girl child’s birth. However, the actor clarified that the reason for this misunderstanding was his appearance. The Shaan actor, who was shooting in West Bengal’s Asansol for a Bengali film, rushed to Mumbai’s Nanavati Hospital to get a glimpse of newly-born Sonakshi. He was still in his get-up where he was required to grow a beard. “I was playing a ‘chandal’ in Goutam Ghose’s Antarjali Jatra, and Sonakshi was born during the making of this 1987 film,” recalled Shatrughan.
“After the climax was shot, Goutam came to me with the good news. He broke the news that we were blessed with a baby girl. I was still covered in mud, sporting a long beard. That is how I was supposed to look. I somehow reached Kolkata (then Calcutta) and managed to reach Mumbai to see my bundle of joy,” narrated the Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha from Asansol constituency.Advertisement

Upon reaching the hospital, his wife thought he wasn’t happy because she had delivered a girl. “Pura filmy scene ho gaya tha!” he exclaimed, adding, “Hum bahot khush the (I was very happy). I had been praying for my daughter for quite some time. After the birth of twins — Luv and Kush — I wanted a daughter. I explained to her that I arrived directly from the film’s set and didn’t grow facial hair because I was unhappy!,” he added.

I used to think that no woman would ever be interested in me, and then, when they were, it’s human nature to lose control. Maine talaaq de diya, in a way… We completely cut off all contact, but I would come to know that she was enquiring about me, and my well-being. She would ask my staff to take better care of me, to feed me properly,” he divulged.",entertainmaent

"Vikrant Massey says Aamir Khan faced repercussions for expressing political opinion, claims Naseeruddin Shah can afford to be blunt: ‘At the age of 70…’","Vikrant Massey, who was last seen in the hit film 12th Fail, recently said that there are repercussions for expressing one’s opinion in public and added that because of these repercussions, one tends to become more individualistic. “There have been people who have taken a particular side and they have faced repercussions for it. We don’t live in a utopian world, ” he said.
In the conversation on YouTube channel Unfiltered by Samdish, when Vikrant was asked if Aamir Khan also had to face repercussions for his statement about intolerance in the country, which was unearthed again in 2022 before the release of Laal Singh Chaddha, the actor said, “Nahi tha? (Did he not face it?)” He then added, “This is it. What can we do about it? Then you go back to the old adage which says ignorance is bliss. Apna ghar baar dekho, apna parivar dekho. (Take care of you house, your family).”
Vikrant added that “we don’t live in a utopian world” and “everyone has a family to look after, everyone has bills to pay.” When the host brought up actor Naseeruddin Shah, who is very blunt with his political opinions, the actor said that Naseer is a very different place in his life now. “Naseeruddin Shah can say all of that now, at the age of 70,” Vikrant said.Advertisement

The 12th Fail actor said that the world is “far more aggressive” now and with the rise of social media, the access to multiple opinions is quite easy now. “These perspectives were always there but because these are so easily accessible at the click of a button… there are multiple points of view and multiple perspectives and a lot of people shy away from it and it’s within their rights to go out there and say that ‘yes, I am apolitical’, even if they are not,” he said.
On Wednesday, Vikrant issued an apology for a 2018 tweet. He wrote, “In context to one of my Tweets way back in 2018, I’d like to say a few words: It was never my intention to hurt, malign or disrespect the Hindu community.” He continued, “But as I reflect in hindsight about a Tweet made in jest, I also release the distasteful nature of it. The same could have been said without adding the cartoon which was published in a newspaper. And I’d with utmost humility like to apologise to each and everyone who has been hurt 🙏🏽”

"Shark Tank India 3: Peyush Bansal offers to buy founder’s Rs 133 cr company for Rs 15 cr, leaves Aman Gupta shocked","A recent episode of Shark Tank India saw three founders coming up with something that could be described as a ‘magic mirror’. Their ‘Beauty GPT’ and AI technology impressed investor Vineeta Singh but despite being not very impressed with the business model of this company, it was investor Peyush Bansal who was ready to buy the company from the founders. The ‘magic mirror’ here is something that is seen on platforms like Nykaa or Lenskart where the customers can try products virtually before buying them. This company’s products are physical so they could be installed in stores.
The company named Orbo AI came in to ask for Rs 1 crore for a 0.75% stake in the business at Rs 133.33 cr valuation. As Vineeta tried their magic mirror, she was thoroughly impressed with it but gave a due disclaimer that her company Sugar Cosmetics was actually in conversation with them to lease out their mirrors. Peyush also tried this on and was quite impressed with the technology they were offering.
As the founders declared that they had raised Rs 26 crore till date, Anupam Mittal exclaimed, “Aap paise raise karne mein awwal number ho (You are too good at raising money).” Most sharks were not interested in the business given its current economic state but Vineeta presented them with a conditional offer. She gave them an offer of Rs 1 crore for 1% of the company, if they get the term sheet of Rs 3 million that was still in the works.Advertisement

This is when Peyush raised the stake. He offered to buy the majority stake of 51% in the company for Rs 15 crore. Aman found this offer quite bizarre as he repeated multiple times, “Company thode bech sakte hain aise 10 minutes mein (They can’t sell their company in 10 minutes).” After some thought, the founders were ready to make a deal with Peyush but wanted Rs 35 crore for 51% but Peyush refused the deal. The founders then accepted Vineeta’s offer.

"Ameen Sayani, the golden voice of India that revolutionised radio presentation, falls silent","“Namaskar behno aur bhaiyon, main aapka dost Ameen Sayani bol raha hoon,” announced Ameen Sayani in 1952 from his underground outpost of Radio Ceylon in Sri Lanka and had a newly independent nation in a thrall. It was for the first time that the warmth and affability of a voice from the radio broke down the sanctioned solemnity and sternness that came in the guise of authoritative baritones, perfect pronunciations, and diction – all of which were associated with state-owned All India Radio.
Sayani’s was a salutation in Hindustani, with all the etiquette in place and pitch-perfect inflections, friendly, simply spoken, somewhat urban, and thus, modern. The voice joked with its audiences, teased them, gave interesting trivia, interviewed celebrities, and punctuated it all with “filmi sangeet”, the kind that was a rage among the youth at the time.

For decades, one cocked one’s ears to Binaca Geetmala, as Sayani played the top 10 every Wednesday from Radio Ceylon, our loyalties bought forever by Mohammed Rafi, Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Hemant Kumar, Mukesh, Talat Mahmood and Kishore Kumar.Advertisement
Ameen Sayani, the golden voice that revolutionised radio presentation to perhaps become its most identified and recognisable voice, passed away on Tuesday night due to a cardiac arrest in his Mumbai home. He was 91.

“I wanted each listener to feel that I was talking to them and that immediately struck a chord. I didn’t expect it to become a phenomenon. They were such fantastic times,” he told this reporter in a 2014 interview.
Born in 1932 to Kulsum Sayani and physician Jan Mohammad Sayani, both of whom were freedom fighters, Sayani grew up amid an academic atmosphere throbbing with ideas of freedom, its significance, and how culture could play a significant role in it. While his father held charge of a hospital taking care of the wounded during the freedom struggle, Kulsum, whose own father, Rajaballly Patel, had been the personal physician to Mahatma Gandhi and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, started a newspaper titled Rahber. The newspaper, on Mahatma Gandhi’s advice, was brought out in Hindustani — a blend of Hindi and Urdu. Gandhi wanted Hindustani to become the lingua franca or the national language of India, thinking that it could bind the nation after independence. This was the time when Hindi and Urdu supporters were using heavy words from Sanskrit and Persian respectively to establish the superiority of either language. Rahber, which began in 1940, stuck to Hindustani, reaching out to many, especially the political prisoners.

From a young age, Sayani helped their mother bring out Rahber, learning the ideology of a secular nation and the role language could play in that.Advertisement
“So right after the independence, it was a moment of pride to speak in Hindustani. More so, if you did it over All India Radio,” Sayani told The Indian Express.
While he spent some time at Scindia School in Gwalior and St Xavier’s College in Mumbai, he was initiated into broadcasting by his older brother Hamid, a well-known broadcaster at the time.
Sayani famously failed his first Hindustani audition at AIR in Mumbai because of a “strong Gujarati and English accent in the spoken Hindustani”. He worked hard on getting his pronunciation right and got the job some months later.
Must read | When Kishore Kumar called Ameen Sayani ‘boring’; conducted his own interview: ‘Go sit in the corner’
But even after joining AIR in 1951, Sayani’s style and tone were slightly loud. When voice artiste and singer Rama Mattoo, who would marry him some years later, heard the voice for the first time, she asked her brother to switch off the radio. Sayani soon realised that he was going to be in people’s living rooms and could avoid a style that was a bit too hyper. He decided to speak to them naturally and normally using ‘bol-chaal ki bhasha‘ like he was a friend discussing and dissecting films and their songs with them over tea. The idea worked.Advertisement
What began as a half-hour programme in December 1951 turned into a rage in 1952. First, it was called Binaca Geetmala, then Hit Parade, and finally Cibaca Geetmala which was how it was known for the longest time.

Soon he began to popularise film music on the radio, a time when the government-controlled AIR was attempting to define the idea of “national culture”. BV Keskar, the I&B minister banned film music on radio in 1952, calling it “erotic and vulgar” and only allowing classical music to be played. After the ban, Sayani began broadcasting his shows from Radio Ceylon.
Radio Ceylon was initially known for Hit Parade – a countdown of English pop that was hosted by their announcer Greg Roskowski and was popular in India. It was after many letters from fans requesting a similar show of Hindi film music that Clifford Dodd, Director of Commercial Service, Radio Ceylon, reached out to Sayani in India.
The first show brought in Rs 25 as salary for Sayani and 9000 letters, some requesting songs and others from women fans who liberally sprinkled romantic adulation for the voice they had fallen in love with.Advertisement
 From a young age, Ameen Sayani helped their mother bring out Rahber, learning the ideology of a secular nation and the role language could play in that.
A few years later, veteran educationist and political activist Aruna Asaf Ali told Sayani that he needed to do these popular shows from All India Radio and not from Sri Lanka. “I told her my hands were tied. She told me she would speak to Pt Nehru about this, which she did,” Sayani had told me.
Vividh Bharti, the commercial broadcast service of AIR began in 1957 and Hindi film music got back to radio then. Sayani, who stayed with Radio Ceylon for a long time, began his sponsored programmes on AIR in 1970. Some of the most significant interviews including that of Lata Mangeshkar, Kishore Kumar, and Raj Kapoor among others were done by Sayani. His favourite remained the show titled Lata Se Darte Darte, where he asked Mangeshkar difficult questions dealing with royalty issues with Mohammad Rafi, her issues with SD Burman, her relationship with her sister Asha Bhosle besides intimate questions on marriage and her personal life – one of the few times Mangeshkar spoke about her life in such detail.
Sayani worked till the end. Until recently, he’d get ready every day and head to his studio in Colaba with his son Rajil Sayani, touch up his old work, record something new, and archive his work. Towards the end, the iconic voice, its thick timbre, would sometimes be broken by bouts of cough during conversations. But somehow, even at 91, when Ameen Sayani spoke through a recording or in a phone call, you dropped everything and just listened. It took you to an India that once was.",entertainmaent
Selvaraghavan denies having any role in scripting Dhanush’s Raayan,"Ace director Selvaraghavan, known from films Kadhal Kondein and Mayakkam Yenna, has dispelled rumors regarding his involvement in the scriptwriting process of his brother Dhanush’s much-anticipated 50th project, Raayan. Speculations were rife that Selvaraghavan, who directed Dhanush’s hit films like Mayakkan Yenna and cult-classic Pudhupettai, might have contributed to the script of Raayan. However, Selvaraghavan has firmly stated that the movie is solely Dhanush’s vision.
In a recent statement on social media platform X, Selvaraghavan clarified his role in the film, and wrote, “Friends, heard reports that I have written the script for D50 Raayan. I clarify that I have NOTHING to do with Raayan’s script or scripting process. It’s purely @dhanushkraja’s dream script and now he has made it into his own film. I am merely an actor in this project.” He further expressed his eagerness to witness Raayan on the big screen, commending his brother’s dedication and hard work.

Raayan marks Dhanush’s 50th film and his second directorial venture following Pa Paandi in 2017. The film also features Sundeep Kishan and Kalidas Jayaram in pivotal roles. Recently, the makers unveiled the title and released the first look of the movie, depicting Dhanush standing in front of what appears to be a food truck. In the poster, Dhanush is sporting a close-cut hairstyle, a thick mustache, and a bloodied apron. Raayan is slated to release in Tamil, Telugu, and Hindi.
Whenever Dhanush and Selvaraghavan have teamed up, it has been a treat for their fans, except for their last collaboration, Naane Varuvean, which turned out to be a damp squib. Now, the tables have turned as Dhanush is directing his brother, and it has to be seen if the student becomes the master.",entertainmaent
"‘Rohit Shetty saw I had potential to play the villain in Singham Again,’ says Arjun Kapoor","Arjun Kapoor is one of those Bollywood actors who, despite hailing from a prominent film family, has been “struggling” to make a space for himself in the industry though almost 12 years have passed since he made his on-screen debut in Habib Faisal’s Ishaqzaade. With an uneven career marred by several significant debacles, apart from a few good performances, Arjun is now playing the main antagonist role in Rohit Shetty’s highly anticipated Singham Again.
The film’s makers had, last week, unveiled the star’s first look from the movie, where he was seen holding a bloodied machete with his curly hair and dense beard adding to the ominous aura. Drenched in blood and clad in black attire, the actor also sported a menacing smile, setting the tone for his villainous portrayal.

Meanwhile, Arjun recently opened up about the new avatar and stated that he gave his all to the role. “I’m thankful to all the directors and producers who have given me a chance to shine. I’m ecstatic that a [successful] filmmaker like Rohit Shetty saw that I had the potential to play the villain in his massively mounted Singham Again. I have given it my all,” he said during a chat with Mid-Day.Advertisement
He also mentioned that he never planned to become an actor but rather fell in love with movies as he spent more and more time observing how people in the industry were dedicated to providing wholesome entertainment.

“So, when I wanted to explore acting, I was not fixated on what I was selected to play on screen. I wanted to feel the same passion and joy that I had seen actors feel when they gave a shot. I wanted to feel the rush to be in front of the camera,” he added.
“I have never been an insecure actor. I have played the lead, I was the first from my [generation] to do a two-hero film in Gunday, the first to do an ensemble in Mubarakan, to play a hero who was a house-husband to Kareena Kapoor Khan in Ki & Ka, and now, I am playing an out-and-out anti-hero,” he pointed out.
The fifth instalment of Shetty’s Cop Universe and a sequel to Singham Returns (2014), Singham Again boasts a stellar star cast comprising Ajay Devgn, Akshay Kumar and Ranveer Singh, who will reprise their roles as DCPs Bajirao Singham, Veer Sooryavanshi and Sangram “Simmba” Bhalerao, respectively. The film also features Deepika Padukone and Kareena Kapoor Khan in prominent roles.

Vishal lashes out at former AIADMK leader AV Raju for his derogatory comments about Trisha: ‘I hope you rot in hell’,"Former AIADMK leader AV Raju is currently facing severe backlash for his comments about actor Trisha. Speaking to the media, Raju made some vulgar and baseless allegations against the actor that left many in shock and disgust. Trisha on Tuesday took to social media to share that she is filing a case against Raju. Now, actor Vishal, the secretary of Nadigar Sangam aka the South Indian Artistes’ Association, has lashed out at Raju.
Vishal released a statement without mentioning any names as he did not want to give attention to the culprit. The actor claimed that AV Raju had done the act to seek attention and that mentioning his name would work in his favour.
In a strongly worded statement, Vishal came out in support of his Samar co-star Trisha. However, Vishal said that he is not making the statement because he is her co-star or that he is the secretary of Nadigar Sangam.Advertisement
Vishal wrote, “I just heard that a stupid idiot from a political party spoke very ill and disgustingly about someone from our film fraternity. I will not mention your name nor the name of the person you targeted because I know you did it for publicity. I definitely will not mention names because we are not just good friends but also mutual co-artistes in the film fraternity. I wish and hope that the women in your house welcome you back home after what you have done, if they even have a conscience, even if you don’t have one. Yes, it truly pains me to put up a tweet to even retaliate over such a demon on Earth.

He added, “What you have done is absolutely filthy and not worth mentioning, But these particular ppl mean a lot personally and professionally. Honestly, I don’t want to condemn you, which is an understatement, but I hope you rot in hell. Once again, I don’t intend to make this statement as a general secretary of the artist association, but as a human being, as much as you can be on Earth, which you will never be. Of course, this has become a trend of trying to make money out of negative publicity about celebrities. Get a job, a better job. You might start as a beggar to learn some basic discipline at least.”

"Sohail Khan says he wants son Nirvan to assist ‘Ajay Devgn, Akshay Kumar, Pankaj Tripathi’, reveals Salman Khan was a good left-arm bowler","In India, cricket and Bollywood are more than just forms of entertainment and often play significant roles in the cultural fabric of the country. The two cultural phenomena are often intertwined. Therefore, it doesn’t come across as a surprise that a horde of Bollywood stars are good cricketers, too, including Salman Khan, according to brother Sohail Khan. In November 2023, the actor and Bigg Boss host were seen playing cricket with the housemates in the reality show when the country was gripped in World Cup fever.
Sohail, a part of the 10th season of Celebrity Cricket League (CCL), while speaking to Zoom TV, recalls his childhood days when the three brothers — Salman, Sohail, and Arbaaz Khan — would play cricket outside their Galaxy apartment in Mumbai. The actor-director revealed that Salman was the biggest fan of the sport. However, the stardom that followed his acting career overshadowed his love for the gentleman’s game. “I don’t know when this switch happened — from cricket to acting. Salman was a left-handed bowler and quite a good one at that. Amid overnight success after he ventured into films, cricket was forgotten. Despite loving sports and adventure, he was suddenly burdened with a lot of responsibilities — of his fans and taking care of himself — he had to tread with caution,” he shared.

He further adds that the siblings never fought over the sport, and they had a lot of fun playing cricket. “We had a long corridor where our father, who instilled the love for the game, would teach us batting. But Salman was the biggest sports lover in the family,” he reminisced.Advertisement
Amid the buzz around Sohail’s son Nirvan making a career in films, Sohail confirmed that the 23-year-old is keen on joining the entertainment industry and becoming an actor. “Hopefully, he will soon start working with a director or actor,” said Sohail.
However, the Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya actor feels that his son should work closely with an actor instead of a director. “Agar aapko actor banana hai toh toh pata nahin kyun log director ke assistant ban jate hain. Senior actors must give junior and budding actors a chance to be around them and learn from them. I would love Nirvan to assist actors like Ajay Devgn, Akshay Kumar, Pankaj Tripathi, Shahid Kapoor, Nana Patekar to observe them and read lines with them,” said Sohail, adding that it is also imperative that he gets scolded by them. “Nirvan unke liye spot pe bhi khade rahe main aise sochta hoon (he would wait for them on the spot). If he works as an actor’s assistant, he will learn the craft better,” he concluded.

When Kishore Kumar called Ameen Sayani ‘boring’; conducted his own interview: ‘Go sit in the corner’,"Radio presenter Ameen Sayani, who passed away in Mumbai on Tuesday, entertained the listeners with his deep baritone voice as he hosted shows on radio. While giving them trivia about Bollywood celebrities, he also interviewed the stars for his radio show Geetmala. Though many celebrities created no fuss in giving him bytes, getting yesteryear star Kishore Kumar to speak to him was a herculean task for Sayani. This, despite the two being friends and going on picnics together.
Kishore Kumar, popular in the film circle for his unpredictable behaviour, became friends with Sayani in the early 1950s. At the time, Sayani aspired to be a singer. Their friendship grew thick and they went for picnics together in Kumar’s ‘khatara’ (old) Chalti Ka Naam Gadi car. When Sayani would request Kumar to sing his favourite song, “Jagmag jagmag karta nikla”, the singer would joke, “You want to hear Kishore Kumar without paying?”
However, in 1952, Sayani began hosting a show called Geetmala on the radio. He had to record the tapes and send them to Radio Ceylon (a radio station based out of Sri Lanka). For that, he had received audio bytes of Lata Mangeshkar and Mohammed Rafi, but Kumar kept cancelling on him. “I was getting a bit cheesed off. Only 10 days were left for the tapes to be sent to Ceylon and I needed his inputs desperately. On being persistent, he asked me to come to a studio in the far-off suburbs,” Sayani recalled in a 2018 interview with Filmfare.Advertisement

Sayani reached the studio with his “giant” recorder, but what happened next made him stop pursuing Kumar for interviews for years. He narrated, “I was stopped by a producer at the gate. He said sheepishly, ‘Kishore called me to say that he’ll only come to the studio to shoot for my film after you’ve come and gone.’ I saw blood. I was hurt and broken. I made up my mind never to ask him for an interview again. I stopped meeting him.”
However, the tables turned in the 1960s. Kishore Kumar wanted Sayani to promote his films like Door Gagan Ki Chaon Mein (1964) and Door Ka Rahi (1971) on his radio programme. Once while hosting a radio show called Saridon Ke Saathi on Vividh Bharati, Sayani met Kumar as he came to promote Badti Ka Naam Dadi (1974). This time, Sayani made sure to interview Kumar and told him, “Didn’t you see two pehelwans (wrestlers) standing outside? They’ll beat you up if you don’t give me an interview.”
Shocked at Sayani’s behaviour, the actor-singer told him that he “bores” people and asked him to move aside as he would conduct his own interview. Sayani later admitted that this interview became the “best” interview of his career.Advertisement

Sayani remembered, “Go sit in the corner and let me conduct the interview. He went on to court martial himself, as Kishore the child, the youth and the adult. He levied charges on himself and also gave answers in his defence. He even played the judge in the voice of veteran Tiwari. This became the best interview of my career.”
Kishore Kumar began his acting career with the 1946 film Shikari, on the insistence of his brother Ashok Kumar, though he only wanted to make it big as a singer in the industry.

"When Ameen Sayani refused audition to Amitabh Bachchan thrice, asked him to take appointment: ‘I would have been on streets’ ","The ‘man with golden voice’ Ameen Sayani, who enticed radio listeners for decades with his unique conversational style of hosting shows, was the reason why Amitabh Bachchan could not build a career as a radio presenter. Sayani used to be so engrossed in his job that he denied an audition to Bachchan thrice, pushing him towards a career in acting, inadvertently.
Ameen Sayani passed away on Tuesday, following a cardiac arrest. He was 91.
At the time when he was hosting a show called ‘Sitaron ki Jawaniyaan’ in 2014, Sayani narrated how he missed the chance to audition Bachchan, who went on to become the ‘Shehenshah’ of Hindi cinema. It was only after the release of Hrishikesh Mukherjee’s 1971 film Anand that he came to know that the man whose voice he loved in the film, is the same man who came to him with the dream of becoming a radio presenter.Advertisement

During an interview with PTI in 2014, Sayani shared that back in the late 60s, he used to do 20 shows a week and most of his time was spent in radio studios as besides being the presenter, he was also handling other processes of radio processing. So, he barely had time to meet anyone, let alone audition a man who visited him unannounced.
“One day, a young man named Amitabh Bachchan walked in without an appointment for a voice audition. I had not a second to spare for this thin man. He waited and left and came back a few more times. But I could not see him and kept telling him through my receptionist to make an appointment and come,” Sayani shared.
Later, at an award show, where Sayani had only invited Bachchan as the chief guest, the actor recalled during his speech that he was denied an audition by a broadcasting firm thrice as they were “too busy to attend him.” Sayani was surprised by the actor’s claim, and he asked his wife Rama, who also worked with him at Radio Ceylon, what the actor was referring to. This is when she reminded him how he had sent away a man saying he should come with an appointment but never met him.Advertisement
‘I regret denying Amitabh Bachchan an audition’
However, the radio connoisseur was happy that he didn’t meet Bachchan for an audition, else he would have destroyed his own career as a radio presenter and would have kept the country devoid of a fine actor as Amitabh Bachchan.
He told PTI, “Today, though I regret denying him an audition, I realise that what happened was for the best for both of us. I would have been on the streets and he would have got so much work on radio that Indian cinema would have lost its biggest star.”
Amitabh Bachchan made his debut with Saat Hindustani in 1969, but exploded on the silver screen with Zanjeer in 1973. The actor continues to entertain the audience even today.

"‘But Amitabh Bachchan was homeless’: Shatrughan Sinha downplays his struggles, says his hunger lasted only two days","Actor-politician Shatrughan Sinha said that he is proud of his Bihari roots, and cannot understand aspiring actors from the younger generation who seek his blessings but are also ashamed of their Bihari identity. In an interview, he recounted his struggles as an outsider from a state that was discriminated against, but said that his contemporaries, such as Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan, had far greater difficulties.
Addressing a gathering at the Sahitya AajTak 2024 event, he spoke about his beginnings, and said that if he hadn’t made the transition from villainous roles to heroes, his career would’ve been over because the heroes of that era were starting to feel insecure of him. He said in Hindi, “There were no TV channels at that time, there was no social media. You had to prove yourself with your grit and determination. I used to go to meet producers and directors with a reel of my own film. The struggle was real.”

Their struggles were greater than mine. But yes, there were times when I stayed hungry for two or three days. But I had a passion, and that helped me persevere.”
Incidentally, the actor has often spoken about being the first choice for films such as Sholay and Deewaar, the success of which established Amitabh as the biggest Indian star of his generation. Shatrughan Sinha is a graduate of the Film and Television Institute of India, and got his start in the film industry in the 1960s. He spent nearly a decade playing supporting roles, before delivering his first hit as the main lead in 1976 and going on to establish himself as a major star.

"A ‘big star’ nearly fell off sofa after being offered gay Hamlet, says Onir: ‘Bollywood actors aren’t ashamed to play rapists, but…’","Director Onir, who has carved a niche for himself in the Hindi film industry, said that most Bollywood actors are terrified of playing gay characters in cinema, although they would happily play rapists and murders. In an interview, he also recalled a narration that he gave to a big star for an adaptation of Hamlet, but with a gay twist.
Praising the work of Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das in the landmark film Fire, he said in an interview with Siddharth Kannan, “Heterosexual actors, when they do gay roles, are very tentative in their portrayal of intimacy. Especially male actors. Even if it’s a kiss, there’s no passion. They’re very reluctant. A lot of actors even tell me that they wouldn’t have a problem doing intimate scenes with women. It’s acting, you’re not supposed to enjoy it.”

He said that actors are fearful to play queer characters on screen, because they’re worried about what people might say. “They aren’t ashamed to play rapists, they aren’t ashamed to play murderers, but to play a beautiful gay person they’re afraid. Their mentality hasn’t evolved. If you look at Hollywood, the biggest actors have played queer characters,” he said.
Asked if he would ever pitch a queer-themed film to someone like Shah Rukh Khan or Salman Khan, Onir recalling a humorous anecdote about pitching one such film to a ‘big star’. He said, “When I see Mammootty play a gay man, I feel so proud, because at least the Kerala film industry is opening up. I remember a few years ago I had approached one of the big stars because I wanted to do a gay version of Hamlet. When I was narrating the story to him, he nearly fell off the sofa and asked, ‘How could you imagine I would be gay?'”
Onir said that he also wanted to make a biopic of the late queer filmmaker Riyad Wadia, and he even had his family’s blessing. But he couldn’t get an actor to sign on; they’d either tell him that they were busy, or politely decline. Onir emphasised that he has never been disrespected by anybody in the film industry, even if he might feel overlooked and ignored.

"Bhumi Pednekar joins Animal debate, says Sandeep Reddy Vanga ‘never justifies’ Ranbir Kapoor’s character: ‘Audience needs to understand…’","Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s latest film, Animal has become a conversation starter, with every viewer having a different opinion about the Ranbir Kapoor-starrer. While some find the film overly misogynistic and violent, for some, it is a complete entertainer. Recently, actor Bhumi Pednekar watched the film and shared her opinion on it. She said though she is not a fan of “hyper-masculine films”, she feels every filmmaker “should have freedom of expression”.
Joining the debate on Animal, Bhumi said while a film director can say whatever they want to say through their film, it is on the audience what they take away from it. On being asked about her opinion on the film during an interview with Jist, Bhumi said, “My genre as an audience is not hyper-masculine films, I get bored while watching them. My genre is rom-com, and romance, I enjoy this genre. I don’t understand action films.”
However, she added, “I do feel every filmmaker has the right of self-expression but how the audience perceives that self-expression is where it becomes tricky. It is a filmmaker’s prerogative, but as an audience, it is on us also to see where are we leading with our society.”Advertisement

Bhumi also opined that Vanga never justifies the actions of Ranbir’s character Ranvijay, “When I look at Animal, I look at a character who is the avatar of max toxic masculinity. I am addressing that, I don’t want my son to become that. I don’t think even the filmmaker is justifying his action anywhere in the film. He is an anti-social element of the society.”
‘Take inspiration from 12th Fail, not Animal’
As per the Dum Lag Ke Haisha actor, it is on the audience to decide from which film they want to draw inspiration, a 12th Fail or Animal. “As a filmmaker, you need to have freedom of expression, but as an audience, we need to understand…like while watching 12th Fail, you know you have to be like that person, take inspiration from him similarly you don’t have to take inspiration from that character (Animal’s Ranvijay),” said Bhumi.
Sandeep Reddy Vanga grabbed the Best Director trophy for his box office blockbuster Animal at the recently held Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival Awards.

Christopher Nolan explains Tenet with popcorn: ‘It isn’t about conventional time travel; explores direction of time through entropy’,"One of Christopher Nolan’s less widely acclaimed films that earned polarising reviews, Tenet has, nevertheless, created a niche fan base that appreciates its unique concept and filmmaking style. One of the major criticisms directed towards the film was that it was too “confusing”.
Renowned for making concept-heavy films, Nolan has now come forward to explain Tenet and its intricacies. In a new video that surfaced on the TikTok channel @guywithamoviecamera, Nolan discussed the concept of his 2020 sci-fi actioner. The video begins with the filmmaker acknowledging the difficulty of discussing it compared to simply watching and understanding or “feeling” it.
ICYMI | Christopher Nolan feels ‘no guilt’ in expressing adoration for Fast & Furious series, calls it ‘a tremendous action franchise’
Nolan further clarified that Tenet isn’t about conventional time travel but rather explores the “direction of time” through entropy. “All the laws of Physics are symmetrical; they are all identical whichever direction time is running in, other than entropy.”Advertisement
He continued, “Now, there’s debate in the world of Physics as to whether entropy defines the direction of time or whether it just shows the direction of time; whether it’s a cause or a product.”
Watch Tenet trailer here:

“Tenet,” he emphasised, “takes on this idea that entropy is the cause. What’s happening in the film is, rather than just moving backwards and forwards in time, machines have been developed that can change the direction of time for an object or a person. So, you are mixing the two directions of time within the same scene, within the same frame.”
“You don’t have to view cause and effect as defined by one coming before the other. There’s nothing in the laws of Physics that suggests you couldn’t look at time in a different direction,” Nolan pointed out.

“So, the scene where the protagonist holds his hand over the inverted bullet and it jumps up to his hand,” the director explained using the popcorn in his hand, “you make it happen; whether or not you drop the bullet, whether or not the bullet flies up into your hand. It has to be your hand; it has to be your will that’s making it happen.”Advertisement
“If the popcorn kernel itself was running in a different direction of time, it can come up into the hand. In the film, we posit that because its entropy is being reversed. That’s how Tenet is created, like the title, as a palindrome.”

Starring John David Washington, Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki in the lead roles, Tenet hit the screens on September 3, 2020, becoming the first Hollywood film to be released in theatres following their prolonged shutdown owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. The film is now getting ready for a one-week theatrical re-release later this month.
Nolan’s latest epic biographical thriller Oppenheimer had garnered global praise and secured victories in key categories across numerous prestigious award ceremonies. Oppenheimer is currently gearing up for the 2024 Oscars.

"‘Karan Johar wept in the editing room, recommended the film to Aditya Chopra’: Onir recalls journey with My Brother Nikhil","Director Onir recalled how supportive filmmaker Karan Johar was of him back in the day, when he not only agreed to watch a cut of the queer-themed My Brother Nikhil, but also recommended that his friend, Aditya Chopra, distribute it. My Brother Nikhil announced Onir’s arrival on the scene, and went on to win two National Film Awards. In an interview, Onir recalled what Karan told him after watching the film when it was being edited, and said that to the filmmaker’s credit, he doesn’t hold grudges.
He told Siddharth Kannan, “I was very scared, Karan is one of the biggest directors. Sanjay Suri invited him to watch the film in the editing room in 2005, when we were trying to find distribution for it. I was so nervous, it was my first film. I kept smoking outside while Karan watched. When he came out, he was crying. He said to me, ‘Onir, I can’t talk to you right now’.”
Also read – Karan Johar confesses he’s paid people off to say positive things about his ‘average’ films, engineered false perception about flopsAdvertisement
Onir continued, “I think Karan cried because he could relate to the film as a human being, as a person, as the story of someone whose stories people don’t speak about. He connected with the relationships, and the film touched him. He was the one who recommended the film to Aditya Chopra, and I’m so lucky to have had my first film be distributed by a banner as big as YRF. I will always be grateful to Karan for having done that, because we were finding it very difficult to get a distributor.”
But recently, Onir couldn’t help but comment about a clash for theatres between Sriram Raghavan’s Merry Christmas and the Karan Johar-produced Yodha. He had written that big filmmakers aren’t as bothered when it comes to independent cinema getting visibility. He was reacting to Karan’s post about not being consulted before a potential box office clash. Asked if he’d met Karan after the incident, Onir said that to the director’s credit, he always meets him warmly.
“Hats off to Karan Johar for that. Whenever he meets me, even after a nasty tweet of mine, he meets with love, and always asks how I’m doing. He doesn’t mix… At the same time, when Rocky Aur Rani comes out, I will write as many good things about the film because it is so progressive,” Onir said.

"Shah Rukh Khan’s speech at DPIFF deserves an award of its own: ‘I am a bit greedy, but Vidhu Vinod Chopra is happier than even me’","At the recently held 2024 Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival Awards in Mumbai, Shah Rukh Khan won the Best Actor award for his recent film, Jawan. On Tuesday, SRK secured the Best Actor award after many years, revealing that he was wondering if he would ever get an award again. In an emotional acceptance speech, he thanked his fans, jury, and contemporaries, and opened up about how he often finds himself filled with self-doubt.
Expressing gratitude, the Pathaan actor said, “Shukriya sari jury member ka jinhone mujhko Best actor ke liye layak samjha… aur bahut saal ho gaye mujhe best actor ka award nahin mila toh aisa lagne laga tha ki ab milega hi nahin. Mujhe bahut khushi hai. Mujhe awards bahut ache lagte hain, main thoda lalchi hoon (I thank the jury who considered me worthy of the Best Actor Award. I haven’t been given the Best Actor Award in a long time. It seemed as if I would not get it again. So, I am extremely happy. I love receiving awards. I am a bit greedy).”
Shah Rukh extended his gratitude to the Jawan director Atlee, co-stars Nayanthara and Vijay Sethupathi, singer-songwriter Anirudh Ravichander, and the entire cast and crew, adding that he was touched by the honor. He emphasised, “I am genuinely thrilled and touched that people have recognised the work that I have put in. The work of an artist is not important; all the people around him or her make everything come together.” Nayanthara, his co-star in Jawan, was awarded the Best Actress for her outstanding performance in Jawan, which was presented to her by Shah Rukh himself.Advertisement

"Ameen Sayani, the grand old man of Indian radio, dies at 91","Ameen Sayani, the iconic radio presenter of the popular show “Binaca Geet Mala”, passed away on Tuesday of a heart attack. He was 91. Sayani’s son, Rajil Sayani confirmed the news of his father’s death to Indianexpress.com. He said that his father suffered a heart attack on Tuesday night after which they took him to HN Reliance Hospital, Mumbai, where he breathed his last. Rajil shared, “The doctors at the hospital attended him but couldn’t save him and he was declared dead.”
Born in 1932, Ameen Sayani came from a family where literature and language were of paramount significance. He would assist his mother, Kulsum Sayani, in editing a fortnightly journal called “Rahber”, which was initiated by Mahatma Gandhi. It was simultaneously published in Hindi, Urdu and Gujarati, while his brother was the eminent English broadcaster Hamid Sayani. Ameen Sayani began his stint with Radio Ceylon in 1951.
Also read | When Ameen Sayani shattered Big B’s dream of becoming RJAdvertisement
“Namaskar bhaiyon aur behno, main aapka dost Ameen Sayani bol raha hoon,” the voice coming from radio sets that looked like large wooden boxes back in the day entranced the audience in a recently independent India. He eschewed the serious tone of radio presenters and used a style and language that was accessible yet informative. His presentation and show became an immediate hit when All India Radio banned the transmission of any Bollywood numbers. It also became a medium for the promotion of simple Hindustani, something that connected with the people across the country.
His show, Binaca Geetmala, which began as a 30-minute programme on Radio Ceylon turned into a rage in the 1950s. It went through several name changes but never lost its essence — Binaca Geetmala, Hit Parade and Cibaca Geetmala. It ran from 1952 to 1994, and was revived in the early naughts; it also moved stations and was later broadcasted on All India Radio’s Vividh Bharti.
As a voiceover artiste, he holds a record for hosting and compering over 54,000 radio programs. He also hold a record in the Limca Book of Records for his contributions to approximately 19,000 jingles as a voiceover artiste.
His interactions with the stars of the Golden Era also had their own fan following — like when he asked Lata Mangeshkar about difficult questions dealing with royalty issues with Mohammad Rafi and marriage, when Kishore Kumar interviewed himself on his show or his interview with Raj Kapoor.Advertisement
Reminiscing those times, Ameen had told Indian Express in an interview, “I wanted each listener to feel that I was talking to them and it immediately struck a chord. It, surprisingly, even revolutionised radio presentation. I didn’t expect it to become a phenomenon in the coming years. They were such fantastic times. It was my romance with Radio Ceylon.”",entertainmaent

"Kareena Kapoor comes face-to-face with Shahid Kapoor at awards show, walks past without acknowledging him. Watch","Fans couldn’t stop fixating on the awkward moment when Hollywood actor Vanessa Hudgens ran into her ex-boyfriend Austin Butler, whom she dated for almost 10 years, at an Oscars party. A similar moment occurred on Tuesday evening, when Kareena Kapoor Khan encountered her ex-boyfriend, actor Shahid Kapoor, at the Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival Awards. Photos and videos capturing the awkward encounter on the red carpet were widely shared on social media.
In the clip, Shahid was seen on the red carpet alongside filmmakers Raj and DK, holding trophies in their hands. While engaged in conversation, Kareena entered with her entourage, adorned in a dazzling heavy lehenga for the award night. Although she briefly paused to greet the filmmakers, Kareena walked past Shahid without acknowledging him, adding to the tension of the moment, which was captured by cameras.

Fans of Shahid and Kareena were quick to notice the uneasiness of the encounter. One fan remarked, “Shahid smiled in response to Kareena’s apparent disregard.” Another fan commented, “She gracefully ignored Shahid, and Shahid, in turn, maintained his composure with a smile.” Yet another fan observed, “She clearly avoided him, wow.”
Kareena and Shahid’s romance began on the sets of Fida in 2004, and they dated until 2007, parting ways during the filming of Jab We Met. They also starred in Chup Chup Ke (2006) and Udta Punjab (2016). The two, however, didn’t have a scene together in the latter. Both actors have since moved on with their lives.

Vikrant Massey apologises for viral 2018 tweet featuring Ram-Sita cartoon: ‘Never my intention to hurt Hindu community’,"Actor Vikrant Massey has issued an apology on social media for a now-deleted tweet, which he made in 2018 while expressing anger over the gangrape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kathua. In his apology, Massey wrote that he never intended to ‘hurt, malign or disrespect’ the Hindu community.
In 2018, the actor shared an editorial cartoon which showed Goddess Sita telling Lord Ram, “I’m so glad I was kidnapped by Ravan and not by your bhakts!” Posting the cartoon on his X account (then Twitter), the 12th Fail actor wrote, “Half baked potatoes and half baked nationalists will only cause a pain in the gut. #KathuaCasr #Unnao #Shame.”
The actor’s post started doing the rounds again on social media on Tuesday, after which he deleted it.Advertisement

He continued, “But as I reflect in hindsight about a Tweet made in jest, I also release the distasteful nature of it. The same could have been said without adding the cartoon which was published in a newspaper. And I’d with utmost humility like to apologise to each and everyone who has been hurt 🙏🏽”
“As you all by now know, that I hold all faiths, beliefs and religions with the highest possible regard. We all grow up with time and reflect upon our mistakes. This was mine,” Massey concluded.
In a recent interview, Vikrant Massey spoke about growing up in a diverse household, as his family members follow different religions.Advertisement

My mother is Sikhni, my father is a church-going Christian, he goes to church twice a week. From a young age, I have seen a lot of arguments related to religion and spirituality.”

Bramayugam box office collection Day 6: Mammootty’s horror film to hit Rs 35 crore mark globally today; holds steady in domestic market,"Although it’s challenging to translate positive reviews into increased ticket sales and subsequently higher box office figures, director Rahul Sadasivan’s Mammootty-starrer Bramayugam is proving successful in doing so as it continues to perform well even during weekdays.
After passing the crucial Monday test, Bramayugam recorded an India nett collection of Rs 1.4 crore on Tuesday, according to early estimates from industry tracker Sacnilk, which is just Rs 25 lakh less than its previous day’s figure. This brings Bramayugam’s total domestic nett collection to Rs 15.8 crore. The Mammootty film has so far grossed Rs 34.05 crore globally.
Post Credits Scene | Bramayugam: Mammootty’s miraculous run continues with the most hopeless Indian horror film in years, a take-no-prisoners tirade against humanity
On Tuesday, the film achieved an overall occupancy of 23.60 per cent in the Malayalam market. Initially, the morning shows had a mere 13.70 per cent occupancy, but this steadily increased throughout the day, reaching 18.73 per cent during the afternoon, 26.44 per cent in the evening and peaking at 35.53 per cent during the night shows.Advertisement
In Kerala, the film earned Rs 1.06 crore on the sixth day in theatres, as reported by local industry tracker What The Fuss, with 69,447 admissions across 768 shows, achieving an occupancy rate of 31.35 per cent collectively.
Watch Bramayugam trailer here:

Bramayugam has been consistently outperforming both Mammootty’s previous film, Kaathal – The Core, and director Lijo Jose Pellissery’s Mohanlal-starrer Malaikottai Vaaliban in the domestic market. While Kaathal only managed an India nett collection of Rs 60 lakh on its first Tuesday in theatres, Malaikottai Vaaliban fared even worse, with only Rs 44 lakh in earnings.
In his review of Bramayugam, The Indian Express’ Anandu Suresh wrote, “The horizons of the movie are expanded by Rahul’s adept use of mythology, wherein dark magic and the concept of Chaathan come into play, creating a horrifying atmosphere. While he has consistently displayed brilliance in portraying grey characters, with Baskara Pattelar in Vidheyan (1994) and Kuttan in Puzhu (2022) being prime examples, Mammootty surpasses himself in Bramayugam, exuding darkness like never before.”",entertainmaent
"Bramayugam: Mammootty’s miraculous run continues with the bleakest Indian horror film in years, a take-no-prisoners tirade against humanity","A wickedly deceptive film that aims to subvert every theme it tackles — gender, caste, the conventions of horror cinema — director Rahul Sadasivan’s Bramayugam is perhaps the most nihilistic mainstream Indian movie in years. Even Sandeep Reddy Vanga, determined as he often is to be the edgiest person in the room, would shudder at the thought of presenting a world this bleak — although, incidentally, at least one subplot in Bramayugam is very similar to the central revenge story in Animal.
The rest of it, believe it or not, takes the standard issue uprising template that is so popular in South Indian films, and refashions it into something that A24 would happily acquire and market to within an inch of its life. Brayamayugam stars Mammootty — the Malayalam cinema icon who is currently in a zone that only Denzel Washington has existed in before him — as a man who appears to be rotting in real-time. This man is Kodumon Potti, introduced to us as an upper-caste landowner in 17th Century Kerala, but later revealed to be a shapeshifting ‘goblin’ in human form.
Also read – Kaathal – The Core: Jeo Baby must kill his inner crowd-pleaser; it’s the only thing separating his films from true greatnessAdvertisement
Kodumon lives by himself in a crumbling old mansion in the middle of a forest, although he has an Igor-like servant to do his bidding. This man, whose responsibilities include cooking for his ‘master’ and also disposing of dead bodies on his behalf, expels spittle and snark in equal measure. One day, a mysterious stranger named Thevan shows up at their doorstep, starving for food and desperate to outrun the slave traders that he has just escaped from. Thevan is taken aback at Kodumon’s generosity, which he views as genuine, but we, the viewers, immediately recognise as performative. He is offered a meal and lodging, despite having alerted Kodumon to the fact that he belongs to a lower caste. The foreboding doom builds.
 Mammootty in a still from Bramayugam.
With a sick smile and a creepy cackle, Kodumon insists that one’s station in society isn’t always defined by where they were born, but can be changed by their ‘karma’. All he wants in exchange for his hospitality, he says, is for Thevan to be his personal iPod, and sing songs for him upon demand. It sounds like a good deal to him. But almost immediately, he learns that the house holds many secrets, the most alarming of which might be connected to the sounds of clamouring and clanging emanating from the attic.
With hat-tips aplenty to the works of Andrei Tarkovsky, Christopher Nolan, Robert Eggers, and most significantly, Gothic horror of the 1940s, Bramayugam is filmed in a mesmerising monochrome that harkens back to the glory days of Nosferatu and Universal monsters. But as old-fashioned as Sadasivan’s inspirations may be, his anxieties feel frighteningly urgent. It is clear almost instantly that the film’s primary theme is caste-conflict. Thevan is initially subservient, even going so far as to scold Kodumon’s cook for speaking ill of their ‘master’ behind his back. This, the movie says, is how the oppressed have been wired to operate. Choice is merely an illusion for people like Thevan, an idea that the movie demonstrates through a game of dice that he obviously loses because it’s been rigged against him.

It doesn’t take him too long to realise that he isn’t going to be allowed to leave the mansion at all, bound as he is by his accursed fate. And this is when, while dealing with his sudden desire to introduce lore, Sadasivan begins building a roadmap to the rude shock that he wants to deliver. Bramayugam isn’t merely a film about oppression, it’s a film about infighting among the oppressed. You’ve been living off scraps all your life, the cook tells Thevan in one scene, foreshadowing the dogfight that he — the son of a ‘housemaid’ — will initiate in the climax. It’s a move straight out of the Bong Joon-ho playbook, and Sadasivan underlines his grand statement in the film’s final moments, when the cook is killed by Portuguese invaders, implying that internal disharmony was the main reason why India fell to the Europeans.Advertisement
 Mammootty in a still from Bramayugam.
This is the ‘bramayugam’ — the age of madness. God didn’t create these divisions, the film says; they were created by men. And Bramayugam represents the dominance of men by virtually erasing women from the equation. There’s room only for one female character, a forest-dwelling succubus whose minor presence is more confusing than anything else. She exists, perhaps, only as an Easter egg that those familiar with the folklore would appreciate, and appears in the film’s opening scene, before the spectacular title card, and then once again much later, when Thevan spots her mid-liaison with Kodumon.

Bramayugam is a suitably ambitious (and understandably flawed) follow-up to Sadasivan’s Bhoothakaalam, pound for pound the best Indian horror movie in years. More than anything else, the film’s immersive storytelling and welcome aversion to cheap scare-tactics establishes Sadasivan as the country’s foremost horror filmmaker — he’s India’s answer to Mike Flanagan. Men are doomed to fight endless wars among themselves, while women are literally erased from existence. Evil, greed, and toxicity perseveres. This is the hopeless (and sobering) note that Bramayugam ends on. Madness is only an excuse, the real rot lies within.

"Anshula Kapoor remembers late mother, her teachings in a moving speech: ‘Tujhe jo banana hai, jo karna hai kar, bas khush reh’","Glimpses from Anshula Kapoor’s emotional speech — where she remembers her late mother Mona Shourie — at the Spoken Fest 2024 have been winning the internet for two weeks. Both Janhvi Kapoor and Arjun Kapoor gave Anshula a shoutout on their social media handles for her moving speech, reminiscing about Mona and the life lessons she imparted to the 33-year-old entrepreneur.
Now, Kommune India has released the full video of Anshula’s speech on its YouTube Channel, which left many teary-eyed. While performing at the festival on February 3, coinciding with Mona’s 60th birth anniversary, Anshula recalled how her late mother would always end a phone call with ‘Rabb Rakha (May God protect you)’. “Endings have always been difficult for me. I’m bad even at ending a phone call, but my mother had it figured out. It was her habit to end every phone conversation with ‘Rabb Rakha,’ which was her way of saying ‘I’ll see you soon,’” shared Anshula, adding that the words gave her hope and strength. The video also shows Arjun wiping off his tears. After battling cancer, Mona passed away on March 25, 2012.
Anshula Kapoor remembers the time when she learned about her mother’s deteriorating condition, narrating, “In Feb 2012, I was in my final year of my Bachelor’s degree, studying in New York when the doctors told us that mom’s cancer had spread to her brain and her spinal fluid, and that she may have had five months to a year left with us when I flew back home.”Advertisement
Even with her poor health, when she momentarily regained her ‘lost’ voice, Mona gave Anshula a list of things to finish on a phone call. “Beta, make sure to pay the Tata sky bill and refill the MNTL account. Bhul na jaao isliye likh lena (write these down lest you forget it). Don’t forget to pick up Arjun’s curtains from the laundry but even then, her once vivid, vicious voice had already started feeling and sounding so much more timid and sunken.”

A visibly choked Anshula said she tried to remember her mother’s every breath on that call not knowing that Mona was counting her last ones on the hospital bed. “I went over this last conversation of ours over and over again in my head trying to memorize every detail, remembering her high notes and her pauses,” she shared.
Addressing the grief she suffered after her mother’s demise, Anshula Kapoor said she felt like her world had collapsed and as “if her spinal cord was getting detached from the rest of her body”. “I remember frantically trying to search for any last message, a letter, an SMS, or even a list of tasks that were incomplete and left for me to finish, from my mother. I was convinced that this is not how Maa would say goodbye because she was always so good with endings and this was the most final of all ends so where was the love and hope I was supposed to find with this story during those two months,” expressed Anshula, stressing that one of her worst fears—forgetting what mom looks like when she was happy—was almost becoming true.Advertisement
“I realised I no longer remembered her voice. I couldn’t hear one voice I heard most of all for 21 years of my life, the voice that put me to sleep, the voice that asked me every day ‘khana khaya kya khaya?,’ the voice that took away all my insecurities and fears, the only voice that always said the right things, in my head,” she narrated.
She wondered how she could live in a world where she could no longer see her mother or hear her voice again. “I kept wishing that we had more photos and videos of her but ours wasn’t a generation of selfies or an Insta Story. I was not the kind of person who was constantly recording everything happening around me. I rushed through all the family albums that I could find—any little video footage that we had collected over the years for that one glimpse of maa, just one but maa is nowhere to be found. Her voice was still missing for five long months of breakdowns and constantly berating myself for not being able to keep my Maa’s memory alive,” Anshula revealed.
Anshula, then, shunned herself from spending time with her friends, family, and from the world because she thought everything was a distraction from hearing mom’s voice. “I remember wishing Maa to help me make this ending better. I kept rummaging through all the video footage that I could find over and over and over again trying to find that one glimpse of my mom and I never succeeded because I was doing it all wrong. One day, sitting on the bed, I decided to try again and I opened my laptop and went through every folder that had any video in it, and there it was… that elusive five-second voice clip of my Maa talking to our dog,” said Anshula while fighting back tears.
“Hi baby!” echoed the voice played on Anshula’s phone. “Her voice brought back 21 years of my mom back to me. It was like a beacon of hope for a ship that had been sinking for far too long. I remember sharing the clip with my brother immediately because I found Maa. She was always there with me. When I look back now, I see that my grief was so heavy that in order to protect myself from feeling any more pain that I perhaps would not have been able to handle, my brain locked me out of accessing any memories of my mom,” she recalled.Advertisement
Anshula recalled how the voice gave her hope and inspiration, “I was now ready to listen to whatever it was that she had to say. “Tujhe Jo banana hai, tujhe jo karna hai tu, kar bas khush reh (You do whatever you want, be what you want to be, just be happy),’ she always said this to me. She stressed, ‘What do you do with your life just make sure your heart is singing.’ I never understood what that meant. I just hadn’t understood how powerful a song, a laugh, or voice can be. Today is her birth anniversary. She would have been 60 today,” said Anshula before signing off with ‘Rabb Rakha!’

Later, entrepreneurs offering a service to repair and deliver broken phones face tough scrutiny from Anupam Mittal.

In a previous interview with CNBC-TV18, Anupam Mittal disclosed his most profitable investment to date. He stated, “Cash in cash out interactive avenues were good. Because it was only a matter of few years and we exited with several hundred crores. Because I owned such a significant chunk of the company, I got all cash. The other one was Makaan.com. I founded that company also. Interestingly, we were on the verge of closing it because of lack of capital. So, I invested some money in it from the money I earned from interactive avenues and spun it out. REA group bought us out and I made multiple times my money in a window of two years. But in terms of return and absolute value Ola still values at the top.”

Divya Agarwal and Apurva Padgaonkar’s journey began when they first crossed paths after Divya won Miss Navi Mumbai, and the pageant organizers introduced her to Apurva.

Ranveer Singh, Vaani Kapoor and many other celebrities congratulated the new parents in the comments section of the post.
Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma kept the news of their pregnancy under wraps. Unlike the first time around, the couple waited to announce their joy.
A few weeks ago, cricketer AB de Villiers shared that Virat and Anushka were expecting their second baby. On his YouTube channel, the cricketer said, “Yes, his second child is on the way. Yes, it’s family time and things are important to him. If you are not true and genuine to yourself, you lose track of what you are here for. I think most people’s priority is family. You can’t judge Virat for that. Yes, we miss him. But he has made absolutely the right decision.”
However, shortly after, he said that this was “false information” and told Dainik Bhaskar, “I made a terrible mistake at the same time, sharing false information, which was not true at all.”Advertisement
Recently, Virat Kohli withdrew from the Test series against England leading many to speculate that the couple was indeed expecting a baby.
Anushka Sharma has not had a film release since 2018’s Zero. The actor will next be seen in cricketer Jhulan Goswami’s biopic Chakda Xpress.
The couple welcomed their daughter Vamika in January 2021. Virat and Anushka got married in 2017 after dating each other for several years.

"Alia Bhatt reveals daughter Raha has a ‘natural love for animals’, recalls rescuing kittens with sister Shaheen: ‘My mother would throw a fit’","Alia Bhatt is currently immersed in promoting her upcoming web series Poacher, for which she serves as an executive producer. The series, based on real-life incidents, delves into the lives of forest officials uncovering an ivory poaching ring. In a recent interview, Alia elaborated on her decision to back the project and shared insights on how her daughter, Raha, is connecting with nature.
In a conversation with The Hindu, Alia disclosed her motivation behind supporting Poacher. She said, “When you are a child you are naturally connect with nature and you feel a sense of clam around animals and I am seeing this first hand literally witnessing my daughter grew up around animals and she has a natural love and excitement around them. Over the couple of years when you grow up, your mind gets filled with school and life and it all gets cluttered. There is a scientific explanation that when you see green your body releases dopamine and their is a natural sense of calmness that you feel.”
Alia’s deep connection with animals goes back to her childhood. Explaining the same, she said, “My love for animals started as a child when me and my sister would rescue kittens and sometimes foster and give them away or sometimes keep them with us. My mother used to throw a fit saying that ‘what are you doing?’ But then she would also get attached. So, it happened inherently happened. I think we all have a responsibility towards our planet.”

Emraan Hashmi admits wife’s insecurity over kissing scenes; reveals producers exploited his ‘serial kisser’ image: ‘I received the flak’,"Emraan Hashmi, once dubbed as the ‘serial kisser’ of Bollywood for his bold roles in films like Murder, Aksar and Crook, has consciously attempted to distance himself from this label over the years. In a recent interview, the actor admitted that despite his efforts to minimize sensual scenes in his films, a certain image had already been established in the minds of the audience, which some producers exploited.
Speaking to Bollywood Hungama, Emraan was questioned about why he had stopped doing kissing scenes in films and whether he had ever personally advocated for such scenes. He responded, “It’s the voice of my wife and I listen to that. I haven’t added any kissing scenes in my films. In fact, from the beginning I wanted to tone it down in films but an image of mine was created and a lot of producers took advantage of that. It became a staple thing to please the audience. When I see my films, I honestly feel that in some places those scenes weren’t required but it was an awakening for an audience also. It was a lead for cinema but I received the flak.”
When questioned if his wife felt insecure about him performing kissing scenes, the Murder actor admitted, “Of course she did but not anymore because I don’t do those kind of scenes anymore.” Emraan was countered saying he has done kissing scene in Showtime. He replied to that saying, “She hasn’t seen the show yet. So, she will be insecure after watching it (laughs).”

Varun Grover says people ‘would be flocking to the theaters’ if All India Rank was titled Animal 2: ‘More people would come to watch it’,"It wouldn’t be incorrect to say that comedian-scriptwriter Varun Grover’s middle name is ‘gentle.’ While he may have won accolades for Gangs of Wasseypur and Sacred Games — featuring guns, blood, violence,  at his core, he wants to tell subtle stories of hope. Take Masaan, for instance. The film is all about tender moments, depicting human emotions in the most organic way. Therefore, it doesn’t come as a surprise that the lyricist and comedian chose a film like All India Rank as his debut film as a director.
In a time when films with hyper-masculinity, blood and machismo are becoming roaring successes at the box office, choosing to release a film like All India Rank may seem like a bit of a risk, but Varun is hopeful. While speaking with FM Fever, the writer joked, “If we had called our film ‘Animal 2’ without changing anything in the script, I think more people would come to watch it. Many would be flocking to the theaters in the hope of seeing someone running with a knife.”
Recently, when Anurag Kashyap extended support to Animal director Sandeep Reddy Vanga, the filmmaker faced criticism from his fans and former colleagues, including Neeraj Ghaywan and Varun, too. In response, Ghaywan commented “Cringe,” while Varun wrote “No.”Advertisement

The film, set in the ‘90s, is a story of a young boy, Vivek, who is pressured by his parents to get into an IIT. It portrays the challenges of leaving home, starting a new phase of life, and facing the intense competition among teenagers striving to become IITians. Presented by Sriram Raghavan, the film is set to release on February 23.
The comedian revealed that right after the year of angry men on screen, releasing the film was not his choice, but getting a theatrical release for a film like All India Rank is a big deal, given that it almost took him a decade to make it. “This is the kind of film that I want to see. I have no qualms admitting that I love Pathaan and Jawan. I absolutely loved these films, but I feel theaters should have space for gentle films. Films based on narratives woven around us, our day-to-day lives, drama, comedy, simple rom-coms sans any fancy elements should be shown in the theaters too. I believe the reason why cinema halls exist is so that all kinds of films can find a space,” he said.
High on nostalgia, the trailer of the film transports the audience instantly to the good old days of the ’90s. The filmmaker revealed that the reason why competitive exams became such a huge phenomenon in India is closely tied to the ’90s era. “The ‘90s is a character in the film and not merely a period shown in it,” said Varun, adding, “There was liberalisation, not just in the economy and politics but also in our lives. The advent of cable television, phones, etc., happened in the ‘90s. A lot of new things came into our lives. In an age of STD and landlines, computers came to India, and things like Channel V and MTV entered our lives. It was the first time I saw who Michael Jackson was. AR Rahman became such an integral part of our lives, and there’s a crucial sequence featuring his music in the film. It took us a long time, but we got the rights for it. The film features a PCO booth, which plays an integral part in adding drama to ‘All India Rank.'”

"Johnny Sins opens up about his experience of shooting with Ranveer Singh, says he was overwhelmed shooting with 150 people: ‘Never seen so many people on set’","Ranveer Singh’s latest ad for his sexual wellness brand featured adult film star Johnny Sins. In a recent interview, Johnny opened up about his experience of working in India and said that everyone has been extremely welcoming but he expressed his regret about not getting to see India as he always wanted to. Johnny also spoke about the hugely crowded set which had 150 people as opposed to his set where he usually shoots with 3 to 5 people.
In a chat with Tanmay Bhat on his YouTube channel, Johnny spoke about his time in India and said, “It’s been a little hard because you come all the way here, to a country you have always wanted to see, really not be able to see it. The people have been amazing. Everybody has been extremely nice and what I have seen so far has been extremely cool.” Johnny’s presence in the ad was not declared beforehand so his trip to India was treated as a secret by the ad makers.
When Tanmay asked him about the experience of shooting with 150 people on set, Johnny shared, “I don’t think I have ever seen so many people on set. The largest set I have seen in the US is maybe 15 people and most of my shoots these days are me and the girl usually. Most shoots are 3 to 5 people.”Advertisement

Johnny Sins’ ad with Ranveer Singh went viral on the internet. The ad, which was a parody of a regular Hindi television serial, was not appreciated by actor Rashami Desai as she shared her thoughts on social media. She wrote, “After watching this reel, which is highly unexpected, I felt it’s a humiliation to all the TV industry and people who work in television. Because we (are) always made feel smaller. Actors really wanna work on big screen too, this is how exactly we get treated. Everyone is working hard. But I’m sorry, TV show pe yeh sab nahi dikhate. This all happens on big screen. And nothing wrong in showing some reality but this is reality check for all the TV industry coz I feel it’s a slap. May be I am overreacting. But we show culture and love to our audience. And I am hurt coz I’ve had respectful journey in TV industry. Hope you all will understand the emotion.”
Bhavna Chauhan, who featured in the ad with Johnny, said that she thought she was going to shoot with John Cena and not Johnny Sins. “I don’t know why I misread the name. But to think of it, never in my dreams, I thought that Johnny would be part of an ad like this. I thought wrestlers do a lot of work in India and so I was foolishly thinking it was going to be John Cena. Only after I got the final details, I found out it was Johnny Sins,” she told India Today.

Varun Tej says his father Nagendra Babu never asked a director to cast him in a film: ‘That’s not how we function’,"One might assume that actors coming from a family full of superstars have it easy. But that was not the case for Varun Tej, who recently shared he did face challenges in the initial phase of his career. Varun is a member of the Allu–Konidela family and is the son of actor Nagendra Babu. The actor, gearing up for the release of the Hindi-Telugu film Operation Valentine alongside Manushi Chillar, is the nephew of South superstars Chiranjeevi and Pawan Kalyan. Actors Ram Charan, Allu Arjun, Allu Sirish, Sai Tej, and Panja Vaisshnav Tej are his cousins.
In an interview with Etimes, Varun expressed gratitude towards his family for creative freedom and the space to explore as an actor. While the actor acknowledged that he feels the pressure of coming from a family full of superstars, he was always clear about doing something different from both his kin and contemporaries. “When I began, there were 20 odd big actors in Telugu cinema. My dad asked me, ‘Why should people buy tickets to watch your films? What is it that you’re offering to the audience?’ From the very beginning, the idea has been to do something different from what my family, my brothers, or contemporaries are doing, and that is what drives me towards choosing my scripts. Irrespective of successes or failures, I try to be different from the rest,” Varun said.

The 34-year-old actor, married to Lavanya Tripathi, also opened up about having a supportive family that has been kind enough to let each of them carve out their niche. “I think that is important!” he exclaimed, adding, “They never pushed us to do a certain kind of film or called up a director and asked them to cast us. They never told the director, ‘Work with my son.’ Contrary to popular opinion, that’s not how we function. I don’t think my dad ever asked a director to pick me in a film.”

In an earlier chat with PTI, Yami Gautam had said that people with preconceived notions will not be able to enjoy the film Article 370. She said, “If someone is calling it names… like ‘propaganda’, ‘jingoism’, and ‘chest-thumping’… Any section that goes into theatres already thinking or carrying a preconceived notion that this is what it’s about, you’ll never be able to feel or enjoy the film. There is no point justifying the film to them. I don’t think the audience thinks about these things. This film is for the majority of the audience and we make films for the audience.”
The movie is releasing on February 23 and the makers have announced that the film’s tickets will be available for Rs 99 on the day of the release. Yami shared the announcement on her social media and wrote, “A remarkable release day offer for a riveting narrative! Get your ticket at Rs. 99 on cinema lovers day. #Article370 releasing in cinemas on 23rd February.”

"Shark Tank India 3: Non-coffee drinker Ritesh Agarwal invests in coffee company, calls the founders ‘baazigar’","Business reality show Shark Tank India 3 recently saw another coffee brand seeking an investment from the ‘sharks’. While the company’s founders could not manage to impress all the investors, they walked away with a surprising investment from Ritesh Agarwal. Ritesh claimed that this was his first time drinking coffee and it looks like he was so impressed with the taste of the coffee and the economics of the business that he became the only ‘shark’ who offered them a deal.
The investors of Toffee Coffee Roasters came in with an ask of Rs 60 lakh for 2 per cent of their company, valuing their company at Rs 30 crore. Vineeta Singh was quick on her feet as she did the maths and realised that the company was selling their products at a much higher rate in comparison with their competitors. Aman Gupta, who also realised that the business needed to be refocused, quit the negotiation. Aman also gave them the advice that they should focus on a few products instead of promoting all their products.
Peyush Bansal looked mildly interested in the business but it was Ritesh Agarwal, who claimed to have never had a sip of coffee in his life, who actually made an offer. Radhika Gupta exclaimed, “A non coffee drinker is making an offer?” Calling the team “baazigar”, Ritesh offered them Rs 35 lakh for 2 per cent of their company and the pitchers accepted.Advertisement

I am more like a dolphin probably. When I was coming to the show, my motivation was very simple, I want to support founders. This has been my goal and Shark Tank has not disappointed me. Great ideas are valuable, but more than that it is the founder and person behind the company that matters. I believe the jockey is more important than the horse.”",entertainmaent
Emraan Hashmi says nepotism debate turned into mob-like ‘hate mongering’: ‘Can’t use it as an excuse if you don’t get work’,"It happened one night, on the couch of Koffee with Karan, when the pop culture discourse for years to come about Bollywood was hijacked by one word: Nepotism. Actor Emraan Hashmi says the idea that connections within the industry are solely responsible for an outsider to not get work is “far from true” and bereft of any nuance.
On Karan Johar’s chat show, in 2017, actor Kangana Ranaut had called the filmmaker “flag bearer of nepotism”. The impact of the word was so widespread that it logged itself in the Bollywood lexicon, with many outsiders voicing their concerns over the industry favouring cliques and star kids.
What, however, started as a sincere exercise to look inwards slowly turned into an excuse to slam star kids, questioning their presence in a film and quickly snowballed into a cycle of toxic criticism. Emraan Hashmi, who himself comes from a film family, told indianexpress.com that people latched onto the word “nepotism” without fully understanding its nuance.Advertisement
“I believe there’s a certain communion also in hate mongering. There’s a sense of belonging in everyone jumping on a mob-like bandwagon to bring down something. There’s a kind of intoxication in that. There’s a classic case of that in the nepotism debate. When it was first spoken on Koffee with Karan, most people didn’t even know what the word meant.
“People looked it up and it soon became a thing that trended. People jumped on it, gave their own opinions when it probably wasn’t even their own opinion. They cumulatively saw what was out there in the environment and started jumping on it,” he said.

Emraan Hashmi, who started his journey as an assistant director on Raaz, made his Bollywood debut with Footpath, which was produced by his uncles Mahesh Bhatt and Mukesh Bhatt. The actor said he had his share of good fortune in being part of the film industry because he was a part of a film family. “I have also maintained that I can’t be apologetic about this because this was the hand that was dealt to me.”Advertisement
Emraan said because he had been an assistant director, he has seen closely how difficult it is for outsiders to “even get an entry” in a film office.
The actor said, “Forget about an audition, they don’t even get a meeting with the assistant director. It’s tough, but not impossible. It’s good to throw light on it, protest about it, but beyond a point that protest becomes a crutch, an excuse.”
“You feel you didn’t get something because the other person is getting it because of their film connections. That’s far from true. There are people who have pushed through and have gotten in… Nepotism is never going to go. You will have people who would want to push people from their own tribe. They will look out for each other, that’s embedded in our DNA. But it’s an industry where we can co-exist,” he added.
Emraan Hashmi will be next seen in Disney Plus Hotstar series Showtime, which aims to shed light on the workings of the film industry in a fun, slightly over-the-top manner. Showtime is created and written by Sumit Roy with Mihir Desai attached as a showrunner.Advertisement
The series, directed by Mihir Desai and Archit Kumar, also stars Rajeev Khandelwal, Mouni Roy, Naseeruddin Shah, Mahima Makwana and Shriya Saran in key roles. It will premiere on March 8.

FEUOK to stop releasing new Malayalam films from February 22 over ‘breach of OTT release agreement’; producers’ association retorts,"The film industry in Kerala is facing increased tension as the producers’ and film exhibitors’ associations clash over the release of Malayalam films. Following FEUOK’s announcement that it won’t screen Malayalam movies set to release in theatres from February 22, the Kerala Film Producers’ Association and Film Distributors’ Association have jointly declared they will not cooperate with theatres that do not screen the films as scheduled.
FEUOK, representing theatre owners, claims that film producers are violating the agreed-upon OTT window-period norms, which mandate a 42-day gap between theatre and OTT releases, Manorama Online reported. According to the organisation’s president K Vijayakumar, producers are releasing movies on OTT platforms much earlier, prompting it to take the drastic step of stopping screening new movies.

Meanwhile, The South First quoted its sources as saying that FEUOK has been receiving complaints regarding last-minute movie cancellations in theatres due to a tussle over providing content (digital prints) to exhibitors.Advertisement
The Kerala Film Producers’ Association (KFPA) has apparently banned some newly renovated theatres, stating they won’t receive films unless they obtain content (digital prints of films) from an approved content provider platform.

— Mollywood BoxOffice (@MollywoodBo1) February 17, 2024
According to FEOUK, the producers’ association insist that newly-opened theatres must obtain content (digital prints) provided by their platform, forcing exhibitors to buy projectors that will suit the content provided by KFPA. In Kerala, UFO and Qube are the two major content providers.
While films like Rahul Sadasivan’s Mammootty-starrer Bramayugam and Girish AD’s Naslen and Mamitha Baiju-starrer Premalu won’t be affected by the situation, the highly anticipated Manjummel Boys might be caught in the turmoil.
Last June, FEUOK had staged a protest by shutting down cinema halls for two days, echoing similar demands.",entertainmaent

Despite Karan’s persistent prodding, Ananya chose to keep her personal life private, stating, “Some things are private and special and it should be kept that way, but I really want to talk about my professional life because no one’s talking about it.” In response to Karan’s famous line, “pyaar dosti hai,” she simply asserted, “We’re best friends.”

Reem Shaikh on being threatened by a man on a show’s set: ‘Be grateful I didn’t make your life miserable’,"Karan Wahi, Jennifer Winget, and Reem Shaikh’s show Raisinghani v/s Raisinghani premiered on SonyLIV last week. And while the show has grabbed some attention from viewers, the interesting tale generated a lot of buzz for its star cast too. Recently, when the team sat down for an interview with indianexpress.com, Reem Shaikh shared a story on how she faced some discrimination from a man on a set once.
When Reem was asked how she managed to carve her way in this man’s world, she went on to share this incident and said, “I have had different fights. Obviously it is a man’s world, and also the fact that I am young and have happened to work with people who have been much older than me. On one of my sets, I was told by a man, ‘Just be grateful I didn’t make your life miserable while you were working on that set.’ I have been told this on my face.”

As Reem Shaikh narrated this incident, Jennifer Winget was shocked and angry stating how Reem should have slapped that man. However, the Tere Ishq Mein Ghayal actor said, “I just asked him that what made him think that I would have given him that power to do so because he was not the one paying me. I have been through that several times, but I have also had a very strong man’s support with me and that is my dad. I have always come back stronger. Since I was a kid, he has made me so strong, that if any man tries to mess around with me, I have the guts to look him in the eye and give it back.”

How Delhi 6’s box office debacle paved the way for Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra’s National Award win,"“Filmein hamare zamane mein hua karti thi.” Not that my zamana has ended but sometimes I catch my 30-year-old self uttering this very parental cliche whenever I revisit films from the 2000s. What do I miss? Perhaps the pulsating core of a narrative and the audacity of filmmakers who dared to tell them. After witnessing a parade of chest-thumping nationalist narratives in 2023, it was refreshing to revisit Delhi 6, a film that swam against the tide, survived and now has acquired a pristine place in Hindi cinema’s history.
I remember watching this Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra flick years ago and being mesmerised by it. 15 years after its release, it still has the same effect on me, probably more than ever. Delhi 6 sees Rakeysh bringing the decades-old Ayodhya dispute to old Delhi, a bastion of multiculturalism and heritage. By shifting the conflict to another location and making us see India through the eyes of homesick NRIs, Mehra puts the focus on the jalebi-like sweet side of our country, while simultaneously exposing the tangled complexities lying beneath the surface.
The film thrives on such contradictions – where Hindus and Muslims coexist peacefully in close quarters, but the harmony that they cherish is as fragile as an empty glass vase, one nudge and it shatters to pieces. Men display their devotion to Goddess Durga in loud jagrans but at the same time ogle at a supposedly lower-caste woman while also not letting her enter their houses. These people watch Ramleela unfold in front of them, witness the triumph of good over evil year after year but fail to see the evil of religious bigotry within them.Advertisement

Much of Delhi 6 feels deeply personal — the quaint charm of purani Dilli, the clash of traditions, the vibrant characters — all meticulously crafted by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, a true Delhiite who has witnessed the city’s metamorphosis firsthand.
In his autobiography The Stranger in the Mirror, Mehra reminisces about his childhood spent wandering the alleys of Old Delhi. In the book, he recalled playing hide and seek around Ghalib ki Haveli, hanging out at Red Fort, standing at the top of Chandni Chowk and seeing 800-year-old Gauri Shankar Temple, Delite Cinema, Methodist Church, Sis Ganj Sahib Gurudwara and Fatehpuri Masjid all at the same time. “What a scintillating cauldron of cultural co-existence,” he wrote in the book.
But he saw the Delhi he grew up in change after the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992. “This served as the trigger for the original script of Delhi 6,” he wrote in his book. Like his previous film Range De Basanti, here too Mehra took a real-life instance to hold a mirror up to Indian society. In fact, he even contemplated embedding an actual mirror on the CD covers of the film but later dropped the idea.
Despite having its heart at the right place, Delhi 6 stumbled at the box office, with many attributing its downfall to its ending. Mehra’s last-minute decision to let its lead character of Roshan (played by Abhishek Bachchan) live after getting caught in between a Hindu-Muslim clash didn’t serve well for the film. “Kill your darlings,” Stephen King wrote in his book On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft. Had Mehra heeded King’s advice, the film’s fate could have been different.Advertisement

In his autobiography, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra revealed that the original script of the film started with Roshan’s father spreading his ashes in Ganga and the whole film was narrated in his voiceover. However, the filmmaker succumbed to the formulaic approach of giving hope over reflecting reality and gave it a happy ending. After Delhi 6 flopped, Mehra slipped into deep alcoholism. But he soon snapped out of it and called his cinematographer Binod Pradhan and they changed the film’s ending.

“Six months after the film was released, we spent three days shooting a new beginning — and modified the ending to Roshan not recovering from the mob violence that kills him,” he wrote. The new version of the film went to the Venice International Film Festival and was well received. Later, the same version was shown to the National Award jury and it bagged him the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration.
“I would love to see my version of Delhi 6 with the newly shot ending in theatres again, so audiences can see the story I wanted to tell,” he wrote in the book. While we still wait to watch Delhi 6’s new version, you can watch the happy-ever-after ending on Netflix.

"Operation Valentine trailer: Like Fighter, Varun Tej’s next is also a Top Gun derivative","The impact of Top Gun (1986) is enormous and the ripple effect is still being felt in Indian cinema of 2024. Of course, the new trend of aping Tony Scott’s timeless classic started right after the release of Top Gun Maverick. Bollywood had its Top Gun derivative in the form of Hrithik Roshan’s Fighter, and Telugu cinema is having a stab at it with Varun Tej’s Operation Valentine.
In the film, there is a rogue pilot, who seems to be suffering from PTSD from an accident. His mentor has a bone to pick with him as he is an adamant pilot and a loose canon. Then there is the slick romance between the hero and his commander. They cruise in a bike with fighter jets in the backdrop. Director Shakti Pratap Singh Hada doesn’t even pretend to hide that this is another iteration of Top Gun. Just that we are missing an Ice Man to Maverick.

"Will there be a Bramayugam 2? Director Rahul Sadasivan discusses Mammootty film’s making, decision to shoot it in monochrome","Though many have been praising Bramayugam as one of the finest Indian horror films of recent times, director Rahul Sadasivan recently stated that the Mammootty-starrer, however, does not fit into the conventional definitions of the genre.
“I would call it a mystery thriller or psychological thriller with horror elements. It’s not a conventional horror film that will give you chills all the time,” he said during a chat with Kaumudy Movies.
Mentioning that he conceived Bramayugam as a single film and hence poured his all into it, Rahul nevertheless did not rule out the potential for a sequel. “I invested my whole energy in that film and that energy is over. The ending has been crafted in such a way that it’s left to interpretation. A sequel might or might not happen,” he added.Advertisement

Revealing that even during the initial stages, he never conceived Bramayugam in colour, Rahul told Manorama Online that he believed monochrome would help ignite curiosity in audiences. “Since it’s a period movie, things would seem artificial or as if we erected sets had it been in colour. Black and white helped things blend seamlessly,” he added.
During a chat with Silly Monks Mollywood, he mentioned that the main reason behind opting for black and white was to break viewers’ habit of watching only colour films.
Watch Bramayugam trailer here:

Opening up about why Bramayugam’s team, including Mammootty, prior to release, repeatedly requested audiences not to keep their hopes too high, Rahul Sadasivan said that after the film’s initial posters and teaser came out, many remarked that it was very remarkable. ‘So we became cautious. People began assuming that it would scare them a lot, probably because of my previous film, Bhoothakalam. Since Bramayugam is not intended to scare people that much, we decided to emphasize it as much as possible.’
Asserting that the theme of power and corruption occurred to him first, and the horror elements were incorporated only later, Rahul shared that the title Bramayugam had been in his mind even before Bhoothakalam, driven by a desire for a title that starts with ‘B’ and ends with ‘M’.Advertisement

Pointing out that he took as much time as required during the pre-production phase, Rahul mentioned, “One can never achieve 100 per cent during the filming process. The maximum possible is 50 to 60 per cent. But in Bramayugam, I managed to achieve almost 80-85 per cent, and what you see is almost what I had envisioned.” He also commended Jotish Shankar’s expert art direction for helping enhance the film’s world.
Actor Sidharth Bharathan and Arjun Ashokan recalled that Rahul Sadasivan and the technical crew had created miniatures of the set and blocked the scenes with their help. “At least one month before the commencement of filming, we visited the location and planned all the shots. So, Jotish created the necessary things as per the shots planned. We set a visual language before filming. Even the transitions were pre-planned,” Rahul said, as Sidharth mentioned that Rahul had a storyboard for the entire work.",entertainmaent

"Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone to reunite for Pathaan 2: Reports","The makers of the biggest success of 2023 — Pathaan — are gearing up for its second installment. According to reports, Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone are reuniting for Pathaan 2, and the film will “set the ground” for SRK’s next Tiger vs Pathaan with Salman Khan.
A source told Pinkvilla that Yash Raj Films’ Aditya Chopra has already locked the film’s script, and the story will take place before the timeline of Tiger vs Pathaan.

The source was quoted as saying, “Pathaan 2 will predate Tiger vs Pathaan and will set up the clash of two cinematic legends on the big screen. Shah Rukh Khan as Pathaan is definitely a character that has resonated with audiences, and there is a constant on-ground demand from the audience to see more of SRK in the spy avatar. Soon after the release in January 2023, Adi and SRK had decided to spin Pathaan into a standalone franchise too within the Spy Universe and the former started ideating the sequel of this all-time blockbuster.”

The source further revealed that the makers are looking at starting shooting Pathaan 2 by the end of this year. The source said, “Pathaan 2 is being designed as the tentpole spy film of the universe that will set things up for bigger conflict in the times to come. It will set up the next phase of YRF Spy Universe’s timeline. In fact, Pathaan 2 sets things up for the big battle between Tiger and Pathaan (Tiger vs Pathaan) in the future timeline.”
Pathaan, directed by Siddharth Anand, turned out to be one of the most successful movies in YRF’s Spy Universe. However, it is not clear if Anand will be helming Pathaan 2 too.
Pathaan, released in January 2023, starred Deepika Padukone and John Abraham as well. The film went on to mint a whopping Rs 1,050.30 crore at the worldwide box office. Salman’s Tiger made a cameo in Pathaan and SRK as Pathaan had a cameo in Tiger 3. Now, after Pathaan 2, the two Khans will have a full-fledged film together titled Tiger vs Pathaan.

"Alia Bhatt says she writes emails to daughter Raha, imparts lessons inspired by ‘Indian scriptures’","Trust Alia Bhatt to break every glass ceiling, whether it’s carrying a film on her shoulders, executing mom duties alongside powerful performances, championing the cause of climate change with equal élan, or simply keeping it real on social media. The 30-year-old has set the right example for women.
After keeping their daughter away from the media spotlight for a while, Alia and her husband, Ranbir Kapoor, revealed Raha’s face to the world on Christmas. As a working mother who seeks professional help to take care of her daughter during shoots, the actress revealed in an interview with Glass Magazine that she has started a rather unusual practice to bond with her daughter. “I write emails to my daughter. I started doing this the month she was born,” said Alia, adding that she also sends her pictures.
Alia, who wants her daughter to be her own person, added, “I created an email ID and I write to her. Recently, I found myself writing her an email, saying, ‘I’m not one to tell you what to do. Even as your mother, I want you to be your own person. The only thing I wish for you is to be kind and work hard, no matter what you do in life. Work hard on yourself, relationships, and your career. Just go through the day being kind.”Advertisement

Raha was born in November 2022. One pearl of wisdom Alia wants to impart to her daughter is the importance of kindness in all circumstances. Even on a difficult day, she stresses the need to treat people well. Referring to Indian scriptures, she continued, “No matter how terrible a day you are having, just be kind to people because you don’t know where anyone else is coming from. It’s something that goes way back into Indian scriptures. There’s a certain way that you conduct yourself. You should always treat people the way you want to be treated. That’s the only thing I will say. And I feel like a lot of that gets lost.”

During the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit held in November 2023, Alia explained why she didn’t reveal Raha’s face to the world. “I don’t want it to seem like I am hiding my daughter. I am proud of her. If the cameras were not rolling right now, I would put a giant image of her on the screen. I love her. I am proud of our baby. But we are new parents. We don’t know how we feel about her face splashed all over the internet; she’s barely a year old.”Advertisement

For Ranbir as well, his favourite moments are the ones that he spends with the 14-month-old. He shared in a TATA AIG GIC video, “Favourite memory would be locking eyes with her and having that instant recognition of who I am, smiling, looking at me and giving me a hug and kiss. I don’t think there is any other better moment than this.”

‘Bramayugam set would go silent as soon as Mammootty arrived; only he had power to improvise’: director Rahul Sadasivan on working with the legendary star,"Director Rahul Sadasivan’s Mammootty-starrer Bramayugam is continuing to translate positive buzz into strong box office numbers, having recently passed the crucial Monday test in India. The movie has been receiving rave reviews, particularly for Mammootty’s performance, which many consider unprecedented, especially considering his five decades of stardom in the industry.
However, director Rahul and actors Sidharth Bharathan and Arjun Ashokan recently revealed that the atmosphere on the set was nothing like that depicted in the movie, a horror-thriller set in the middle of a tropical forest. “The entire set would go silent as soon as Mammookka (Mammootty) arrived,” Rahul told Manorama Online, to which Sidharth added, “But it would return to its original state soon after.” “The atmosphere on the set was as if we were making a comedy film,” Rahul said, laughing.

Opening up about his experience working with Mammootty, Sidharth said, “When such a senior actor is reinventing himself, it inspires us to push our boundaries.”Advertisement
Arjun Ashokan, who previously worked with Mammootty in Unda (2019), recalled during a chat with Silly Monks Mollywood, “I was a member of the Mammootty Fans Association during my school days. So, once I entered the cinema, my biggest dream had been to work with him. Though I received an opportunity to work on Masterpiece (2017), I couldn’t join due to prior commitments. It was right after Parava, and I got to know that it was Mammookka who suggested my name. It was such a proud moment for me.” In the same interview, Sidharth recalled that he met the Malayalam megastar for the first time when the latter was working on his father’s film, ace filmmaker Bharathan’s Amaram (1991), which is often regarded as a landmark movie in Mammootty’s career.
Watch Bramayugam trailer here:

Dubbing Mammootty as an inseparable part of Malayali culture, Rahul said, “Do any of us actually remember the first time we saw him on-screen? Like our parents, he too has been a part of our lives forever. While writing Bhoothakalam, Mammootty’s Thaniyavarthanam served as a big inspiration for me. The film also discussed themes such as society’s descent into chaos, social stigma, etc. It was a major reference point for me.”

Renowned author TD Ramakrishnan, who penned Bramayugam’s dialogues, asserted that no other actor can deliver lines like Mammootty. “He would often ask questions, offer suggestions, etc. He is very involved in the entire process,” the writer noted.
Emphasising that there was no space for improvisation since the language used was not contemporary, Rahul added that the only person who could do that was Mammootty. “Even I had no confidence to attempt to improvise the dialogues. But Mammookka did it effortlessly, thanks to his extensive experience,” Rahul told Manorama Online.Advertisement

During that conversation, Arjun and Sidharth also joked that they didn’t receive any compliments from Rahul during filming. “But when shooting Mammookka’s scenes, Rahul would call cut and then say ‘brilliant’ or some other compliment,” they laughed. Rahul told Kaumudy Movies that while he always aspired to work with Mammootty, he was waiting for the right subject to approach him.",entertainmaent
"When Rituraj Singh said he became an actor on Shah Rukh Khan’s insistence, revealed why he never asked SRK for work in films","“He would hug me and introduce me to others as his oldest friend. He would invite me to his vanity van and we would smoke together,” late actor Rituraj Singh had shared about Shah Rukh Khan on his 50th birthday. Rituraj passed away on Tuesday at the age of 59, after suffering a fatal cardiac arrest.
In an earlier interview with indianexpress.com Rituraj Singh had shared how he forged a close bond with Shah Rukh Khan, when they were students together at Barry John’s TAG (Theatre Action Group), well before they even became screen actors. “We used to discuss many things about life. At that age, you are just filled up with everyday stuff and there is an everyday high. We used to rehearse together and play football, among other things. Somewhere down the line, he got the feeling that acting is something that his life is all about and thank God it happened, or else, we wouldn’t have had a magnet of a miraculous star today,” he had said.

Rituraj had also said that they were “thick buddies” who’d often share clothes, and that it was Shah Rukh who’d encouraged him to move to Mumbai and become an actor. “We could fit into each other’s clothes because of the same body structure. We were real thick buddies, and those were the best days of my life. I came to Mumbai to act at his insistence. He would come to Delhi and tell me, ‘What are you doing here? Come, let’s go to Mumbai. You’re such a good actor.”
While SRK went on to become one of India’s biggest stars, Rituraj rose to fame with TV shows such as Banegi Apni Baat, Jyoti, Hitler Didi, Shapath, Warrior High, Aahat, Adaalat, Diya Aur Baati, and Anupamaa, among others. About not asking SRK to get him work in films, he had said, “I have never asked SRK for work because unlike others, I don’t suck up to him and ask favours. But this I know, that if God forbid I am in a miserable situation tomorrow, SRK will be the first one to reach out to me.”

The speculations around Kiara being a part of the hit franchise started doing the rounds when she was spotted at the Excel Entertainment office recently. When Akhtar was quizzed about her casting in Don 3 then, he said, “Well it’s all work in progress. I don’t wanna get ahead of myself and say something that I may have to take back for any other reason but as and when it happens, you’ll know.”Advertisement
When Ranveer was announced as the lead actor of Don 3, he and the makers received a lot of flak from fans of Shah Rukh Khan, who played the role of Don in the last two films in the franchise. But Akhtar assured the audience that Raveen would do a “great job”. He told the BBC, “It really is about an actor coming in and owning the part and making it really like, giving it their style and their flair. And he has that, he has that in spades. So, he is going to do a great job. I think the responsibility is more mine now to make sure that the script and the film work out the way I imagine.”

"Vikrant Massey reveals his brother converted to Islam at 17, opens up about being raised by church-going father, Sikh mother: ‘Religion is man-made’","Actor Vikrant Massey has given an insight into his diverse family: A Sikh mother, a Christian father, a brother who converted to Islam in his teens, a Hindu wife, and Vikrant himself. In the latest episode of Unfiltered by Samdish, Vikrant said that growing up, he witnessed a ‘lot of arguments’ related to religion and spirituality.
Mentioning his elder brother, he said, “My brother’s name is Moeen, I am called Vikrant. You’d wonder why the name Moeen? He converted to Islam, my family let him change his religion. They said, ‘Beta, if you find satisfaction this, then go ahead.’ He converted at the age of 17, it is a big step. My mother is Sikhni, my father is church-going Christian, he goes to church twice a week. From a young age, I have seen a lot of arguments related to religion and spirituality.”

Vikrant continued, “My father was questioned by my extended relatives about how he could ‘allow’ that (brother’s conversion). He said that was none of their business. ‘He is my son, he is only answerable to me and has all the rights to choose what he wants.’ After seeing this, I went on my own quest, wondering what exactly is religion. It is man made.”Advertisement

The actor, who is married to Sheetal Thakur, recently became a father. He said that their goal as a couple would be to teach their baby boy “rationalism,” but there are certain things which are “authentically Indian,” which he respects a lot. “Especially in the Hindu culture, I do believe in them. It is only because of my cultural affiliation; it doesn’t need to be religious. This is the culture of the majority people of my country. Diwali is celebrated only in India, so I celebrate it as well. It is my muscle memory, my childhood memory.
“It need not be religious. I don’t believe that if I do Laxmi Puja then I will be blessed with wealth. I do it because I grew up witnessing it, and it is now my lifestyle. My father would do it. He goes to church twice a week, but he also does puja with my mother and my wife. So, it is a beautiful house,” he added.
Vikrant Massey was last seen in the film 12th Fail. The Vidhu Vinod Chopra directorial emerged as the sleeper hit of 2023 and was rated as one of the best films of last year.

"Shah Rukh Khan fulfils wish of parents who named martyred Air Force pilot son after his Fauji character, wins hearts","Shah Rukh Khan has fans across the globe, and he tries to please each of them. Recently, he fulfilled the wish of martyred Air Force pilot Abhimanyu Rai’s mother, who named him after the actor’s character in the television series Fauji. Rai’s mother, Chitralekha Rai, wished to meet Shah Rukh after her son died in December last year. She wanted to share the story behind his name.
Chitralekha’s wish reached Shah Rukh with the help of Team Saath, which shared a post on X that read, “Dear @iamsrk, Mother of a martyr, Squadron Leader Abhimanyu Rai, wants to talk to you about her son and how she ended up keeping her son’s name on the character you played in the serial Fauji. Give her this little happiness please. Do your thing @X and let this message reach King Khan.”
In another post, it also shared a screenshot of a message from Abhimanyu’s father, and mentioned, “His father, Group Captain Amitabh Rai has been trying to reach @iamsrk for a little support as Abhimanyu was named after Shahrukh’s character in the serial Fauji.”Advertisement

Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya box office collection day 11: Shahid Kapoor-Kriti Sanon’s film enters Rs 100 crore club worldwide,"Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon’s sci-fi romantic comedy, Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya, has saved face after a mediocre opening. According to Maddock Films, the film has entered the Rs 100 crore club at the worldwide box-office, while its domestic collection stands at Rs 62.5 crore in 11 days of release. According to industry tracking website Sacnilk, the Amit Joshi and Aradhana Sah directorial earned Rs 2.25 crore nett on its second Monday, taking its nett total to Rs 60.45 crore.
This marks a much-needed rebound for Shahid, whose last film, the sports drama remake Jersey, bombed badly. His biggest hit remains 2019’s Kabir Singh.

The film opened to mixed reviews, with the audiences loving the fresh pairing of Shahid and Kriti and their scintillating chemistry on screen. The Indian Express film critic Shubhra Gupta gave the film two stars and called it a ‘mish-mash’ of genres. A part of the review read, “For a film which wants to be a family entertainer, there are risible sequences featuring men peering down low-cut blouses-and-bosoms, and tasteless wife jokes. Monty the Hero’s Best Friend does exactly what BFFs have done for decades, make the hero look good: when will this oldest, creakiest device be dumped?”
Shahid will next be seen in Deva, with Pooja Hegde, whereas Kriti will be seen sharing the screen with Kareena Kapoor and Tabu in The Crew.

Bramayugam box office collection day 5: Mammootty-starrer passes Monday test; crosses Rs 33 crore worldwide,"Bramayugam box office collection remained steady on day five as the Mammootty-starrer passed the crucial Monday test. According to industry tracker Sacnilk, the horror-thriller earned Rs 1.65 crore on its first Monday in India. The numbers are excellent, as Bramayugam managed to maintain a drop of less than 50 percent from its opening day figures (Rs 3.1 crore).

The film benefitted heavily from positive reviews and word-of-mouth, which helped it perform overseas as well. While the India gross of Bramayugam stood at Rs 15.1 crore in three days, its overseas gross stood at an impressive Rs 16 cr. The film’s total global gross stands at over Rs 33 crore.
In India, the film performed best in Kottayam, with occupancy of around 54 percent on Monday. It held particularly well in Mumbai and the Delhi-NCR regions, where it recorded an occupancy of 20 and 21 percent, respectively.Advertisement

Kajol also shares a warm relationship with her mother-in-law. She had earlier revealed how she was mocked for calling her mother-in-law ‘aunty’ and not ‘mummy’ but Veena always gave her the time and space for their relationship to bloom. During an earlier interview with Twinkle Khanna on her Twinkle’s Tweak India YouTube channel. Kajol shared, “Fortunately for me, my mother-in-law has given me that time and space. And I know for a fact, we used to sit, and her friends would come over, and they’d be like, ‘Arey, woh tumhe mummy nahi bulati hai, maa nahi bulati hai (She doesn’t call you mom)?’ And my mother-in-law would turn around very proudly and say, ‘Woh jab maa bulayegi na, dil se niklega, dimaag se nahi niklega (When she does, it’ll come from the heart, not from the head).’ I was so heartened, I was touched. She’s giving me the time to grow into whoever I’m supposed to be. She’s giving me that space. My respect for her deepened.”
Ajay’s next film is Shaitaan, a supernatural thriller directed by Vikas Bahl. The actor will be seen in the film alongside Jyothika and R Madhavan. Shaitaan marks Jyothika’s return to Hindi cinema after 25 years. The film is produced by Ajay, Jyoti Deshpande, Kumar Mangat Pathak and Abhishek Pathak. The film is set to release on March 8.

The actor who aspired to become Marlon Brando but ended up being Mammootty instead: An exploration of Bramayugam star’s grey roles,"Do you recall when Shah Rukh Khan, in an interview, discussed his hesitation to portray certain morally reprehensible characters? SRK explained that he feared he would inadvertently make such characters appear attractive and likeable, which he believed should be avoided as they shouldn’t be admired or glorified.
He is right. There is something about him that makes even the most despicable characters like Rahul Mehra in Darr (1993), Ajay/Vicky in Baazigar (1993), Vijay Agnihotri in Anjaam (1994), the titular role in the Don movies (2006 and 2011) and Gaurav Chandna in Fan (2016) seem appealing. Therefore, his decision to refrain from such roles to prevent their glorification is understandable. Nevertheless, this raises an important question: should it be dubbed as SRK’s strength or limitation?
Only in Express | The anatomy of Mammootty 3.0 and how he became a formidable contender even for the younger generation
An actor’s major weakness, which can lead to typecasting, occurs when they are proficient in portraying or choose only certain types of characters displaying familiar emotions, or when they struggle to embrace roles beyond their comfort zone. Even if an actor initially lacks the skill to play varied characters, consistent practice is key to improvement. An exemplary illustration of this is Malayalam megastar Mammootty, whose career serves as evidence that one can cultivate acting abilities through dedicated pursuit of the dream of becoming an actor.Advertisement
Unlike his contemporary Mohanlal, who won hearts with his debut film itself, Mammootty initially showed little promise. Unless he worked on films directed by exceptional filmmakers, his performances often appeared below average.

Nevertheless, despite enduring consecutive setbacks and witnessing his peers achieve success before him, Mammootty did not give up. He wasn’t an accidental actor but rather someone who had come to stay. 52 years and three National Film Awards for Best Actor later, Mammootty remains one of the most promising actors in Malayalam cinema.
In fact, his performances in grey characters debunk SRK’s apprehension, highlighting that any actor can tackle such roles without rendering them appealing. Over the years, Mammootty, considered the epitome of Malayali masculinity and allure, has portrayed some of the most despicable antagonists, yet they never exuded charm, thus avoiding glorification and the latest example is Rahul Sadasivan’s Bramayugam. With absolute precision and by extracting the deepest, darkest facets of the characters, and smearing it all over his face, leaving no hint of his real self visible, Mammootty has consistently excelled in performing antagonist characters and layered roles with heavy shades of grey.
 Mammootty as Kamaran in Jijo Punnoose’s Padayottam.
Caricaturish Kamaran
Yet, this talent wasn’t mastered overnight. Mammootty’s first role as the main antagonist, Kamaran, was in Jijo Punnoose’s epic period drama Padayottam (1982). Despite his current acclaim for remarkable dialogue delivery and commanding body language, his performance in Padayottam was quite caricaturish.Advertisement
Nevertheless, he diligently addressed his shortcomings and displayed improvement in KG George’s Lekhayude Maranam Oru Flashback (1983), where he portrayed a flirtatious superstar, effectively highlighting the character’s cynical nature and thus, demonstrating his evolving skills.
 Mammootty as Captain Thomas in P Padmarajan’s Koodevide. (Image: Central Talkies/YT)
In P Padmarajan’s Koodevide (1983), he took it up a notch as Captain Thomas, the hero-turned-villain. Unlike his previous roles where he struggled to convey emotions with restraint, Mammootty here adeptly navigated a range of emotions. When the film begins, the Army officer is shown as a very ordinary man, leading a rather mundane life and in love with his colleague’s sister Alice (Suhasini). Their endearing romantic interactions highlighted Mammootty’s untapped potential.
But particularly impressive was his depiction of Thomas’ jealousy, triggered by Alice’s close bond with one of her students, a mother-son-like one which Thomas misconstrues as romantic. Mammootty skillfully showcased Thomas’ descent into villainy, capturing his character’s sinister demeanour and willingness to go the extra mile to win Alice’s affection just for himself.

Complex, nuanced Harikrishnan
When it came to Padmarajan’s Kariyilakkattu Pole (1986), he was more proficient, capable of handling complex emotions and juggling between their extremes in the blink of an eye. A renowned filmmaker who’s a notorious womaniser too, Harikrishnan’s (Mammootty) story is unveiled through the police’s interactions with various people following the director’s murder, kind of like the Rashomon Effect. While most dubbed him as pure evil, willing to go to any lengths for his gratification, for one person, he was anything but that.Advertisement
From the rigidity of a film director and the arrogance of a celebrity to the brutality of a rapist and the inner turmoil of a guilt-ridden father, Mammootty sharply depicted the many facets of Harikrishnan with commendable efficiency while ensuring that it remained nuanced. This added depth to the well-crafted film and was particularly evident in the poignant father-daughter scenes and the intense climax.

The devil aka Baskara Pattelar
A man with no known Achilles heel. The epitome of power. A sinister figure who derives pleasure from inflicting pain on others, both physically and mentally. The embodiment of evil. Even these descriptions don’t fully explain Baskara Pattelar’s true villainy. This is not solely due to Adoor Gopalakrishnan’s masterful screenplay in Vidheyan (1994), but also thanks to Mammootty’s exceptional portrayal, arguably making Pattelar Malayalam’s most despicable antagonist. In the opening scene, Pattelar can be seen entertaining himself by attacking Thommi (MR Gopakumar) and asking Thommi if his wife is attractive enough to satisfy Pattelar physically. Mammootty’s performance here is unprecedented, radiating a demonic aura, and his chilling laughter is unlike any heard from him before.
His skill in effectively using dialects came in handy here as he aced the South Canara one, while also adding an extra layer of bass to his voice. Even in Pattelar’s body language, Mammootty ensured that his ruthless nature was evident. In one scene, he is seen mercilessly kicking a man of lowered caste to the ground, aiming for the face without showing any sympathy or concern for potential harm. As he continues kicking the man, already on the ground, his hands seldom move to maintain balance, denoting that he is a pro at it. Mammootty effortlessly presented Pattelar with such nuances throughout.

Ruthless Murikkinkunnath Ahmed Haaji and monstrous Khalid Ahmed
In Ranjith’s Paleri Manikyam: Oru Pathirakolapathakathinte Katha (2009), Mammootty portrayed not one but two grey characters, distinct in their mannerisms yet connected by their malevolence. With a blend of lust for blood and women, Murikkinkunnath Ahmed Haaji was an overt monster, while his son Khalid Ahmed embodied a more sophisticated evil, his crimes hidden from the outside world.Advertisement
Despite their blood relation, Mammootty ensured that they were as distinct as possible, yet shared few similarities. This was particularly challenging since the film, unlike its base novel, did not provide Khalid Ahmed with much of a backstory, which is crucial for understanding the behaviour of villains. Although Khalid appeared only briefly towards the end of the movie, Mammootty effectively conveyed both his sophistication and monstrosity. Additionally, the manner in which he portrayed Ahmed Haaji, a worthy opponent for Pattelar, was unique, with attention to his evolving mannerisms as he aged.
 Mammootty as CK Raghavan in Venu’s Munnariyippu. (Image: Mammootty/Facebook)
‘Freedom’ fighter Raghavan
In Venu’s Munnariyippu (2014), Mammootty portrayed CK Raghavan, a villain who had clear justifications for his actions that were driven by a desire for a peaceful life. Raghavan, like Brooks Hatlen in Frank Darabont’s The Shawshank Redemption (1994), finds his true freedom only in prison. In contrast to Brooks, Raghavan refuses to give up and is determined to weed out anything or anyone standing between him and his freedom. Despite being depicted as an elderly man bound by the demands and rules of the outside world, Mammootty subverted this image with a single smile towards the end, revealing the grey of his character.
Upon reflection or rewatching the film, Raghavan’s actions and expressions in the initial part become clearer. Mammootty played Raghavan with moderation, emphasising how the outside world confined him. His eerie smile, in particular, differed significantly from Pattelar’s, making one wonder if he had discovered a new one.
 Mammootty as Kuttan in Ratheena PT’s Puzhu. (Image: Sony LIV/YT)
Kuttan: the dormant volcano
On the other hand, in Ratheena PT’s Puzhu (2022), Mammootty portrayed Kuttan, an ex-cop who views himself as a victim because others are not caste bigots like him. Fuelled by caste hatred, particularly towards his sister Bharathi (Parvathy) for marrying Kuttappan (Appunni Sasi), a man from a lowered caste, Kuttan is the kind of character who would have easily been portrayed as a hero in the ’90s. However, Ratheena skillfully upended this archetype and Mammootty ensured that he presented Kuttan authentically, capturing his sense of “victimhood” while also depicting him as a villain with finesse.Advertisement
Mammootty delivered a stunning sophisticated performance, especially in moments where Kuttan struggles and fumes internally, witnessing Bharathi’s happiness in her casteless marriage and his son Kichu growing close to them in a way that he cannot relate to, where he is unable to erupt as it would damage his “victim” image. The actor effectively conveyed Kuttan’s cunningness and his capacity to erupt in a subtle yet remarkable manner.
 Mammootty as Luke Antony in Nissam Basheer’s Rorschach. (Image: Asianet/YT)
Letting the characters speak for themselves
On the other hand, in Kamal’s Azhakiya Ravanan (1996), Priyadarshan’s Megham (1999), Ranjith’s Black (2004), Nissam Basheer’s Rorschach (2022) and Midhun Manuel Thomas’ Abraham Ozler (2024), though his characters had heavy shades of grey, their vile sides were mostly triggered by personal tragedies and cannot be dubbed as complete villains. Yet, the actor ensured that each character is distinct and rooted in their environment and life experiences.
Including in Rahul Sadasivan’s Bramayugam, Mammootty’s performances, especially in grey roles, stand out for several reasons. Firstly, he effectively immerses himself in his characters and stays true to their emotions. He has always treated each role as unique, dissociating them as much as possible from his true self, and unravelling their emotions and gestures during his pursuit of finding them.
Additionally, his nuances ensure that the villainy of his characters is unmistakable and utterly detestable, which is also probably why almost no two characters of his, especially the antagonists, bear resemblances or emote similarly.Advertisement

Thus, Mammootty has consistently demonstrated that when an actor fully embodies a character, understanding its essence and motivations and sets aside their self and star image, the character speaks for itself, allowing viewers to form their own judgments. In Bramayugam too, viewers are never charmed by his character, highlighting Mammootty’s skill in portraying complex and vile roles, not making them likeable.
Mammootty once said, “I came into the industry aspiring to become at least a Marlon Brando. But I just ended up being a Mammootty instead.” He might have used his name here to imply that he did not reach great heights. However, the manner in which he has portrayed grey characters itself, each distinct and devoid of charm, underscores that Mammootty is a benchmark for actors to aspire to.",entertainmaent
Ram Gopal Varma: ‘I don’t follow morals or religion but I follow law’,"Ram Gopal Varma, to the current generation, is more known for his controversies than his hit films, which the previous generation lapped up. In a recent interview with Film Companion South, the director opened up about the origin of his rebellion and why he doesn’t respect morals.
RGV admitted that his rebellion started way earlier during his schooling. The director revealed Ramayana: The Poisonous Tree, written by Ranganayakamma, opened the door to critical thinking. “The book triggered that thinking. I think, in a way, because something as revered as Ramayana… was understood by her from a Marxist point of view was incredible. So I didn’t take the Marxism aspect. But the fact that you could challenge (Ramayana), something that you think cannot be questioned… that was my first impact in terms of not taking things at face value, the way they were told to you by your parents or by your teachers or whoever it is.”
ALSO READ | Ram Gopal Varma says filmmakers ‘shell-shocked’ by Animal’s success: ‘South directors are uneducated, that’s why they understand masses’
Ram Gopal Varma then read more such philosophical books which made him a rebel. “I live like a rebel. What is a rebel? Rebel is nothing but going against what is accepted. But I’ll always follow only one thing. I’ll follow the law. I don’t follow morality. I don’t follow religion. I don’t follow… Because the law is necessary. Because if you have to live in a city, you need to follow certain things for the sake of that. And it’s a small price to pay for all the benefits you get from society. So in the four aspects, the only thing I follow is the law. Other three, I don’t.”Advertisement
The Satya director also has an idealistic take on the responsibility of cinema. He said, “What is a film? It is a certain medium that is either used as entertainment or education or whatever the maker chooses to do as a mode of expression. Expression is about one’s outlook toward life in his perspective. And that is what is protected by the so-called freedom of expression. So, why should freedom of expression exist? Why should anyone offend? Why should freedom exist?”
However, RGV cites how moral codes are ambiguous and sometimes curb freedom. “See, we are living in a world where there will be some countries where the ankle of the foot can’t be exposed in public. At the same time, there could be another country where wearing bikinis is not a problem. Then who will determine which is right and which is not? You have to do it. Or if you are abiding by the laws of that society or a community, you can do that. So, the only thing that can be done is by regulation. In that regulation, in my constitution, I am not given freedom of expression. So, some people might like it, some might not. But unless you give that freedom, there will never be a free flow of ideas.”",entertainmaent
"From Hilde, With Love to Dahomey: The undead memories of Holocaust, colonialism","It’s not a Berlinale if it doesn’t have at least one film turning a lens on Germany’s Nazi past. It’s been so many years since the Holocaust, and yet the wound still festers. Whether it is the global upsurge of the right, or a way of keeping torment at bay — cinema can be a successful distancing device — is a question that deserves our attention, and the answers that emerge from it.
Andreas Dresen’s ‘From Hilde, With Love’ tells us about a little-known segment of the German population which was not happy about the rising extremism. The sun-dappled group of young people, whom we see do things that young people do — exchange passionate views, fall in lust — feel like dabblers in rebellion. It’s part of youthful credo to fight against convention, and here we see Hilde ( Liv Lisa Fries) getting attracted to the Communist-leaning Hans Coppi (Johannes Hegemann), knowing that it is exciting and subversive, but without any idea of the terrible fate in store for not just her, but the entire group.
The film, set in 1943, begins with the arrest of a pregnant Hilde. The officer who shows up to pick her up starts by being almost benign– his wife is expecting too, so please can he touch her bump? It feels startlingly intimate; there’s also an entitled offensiveness in the gesture, almost as if Hilde’s body now belongs to the state, for it to do what it will.Advertisement
Soon enough, she is incarcerated, and the only way she can postpone certain death is to make herself useful in the ward with other expecting mothers. She’s been trained as a dentist’s assistant, and is deft with her touch as she soothes the women in pain, even as she raises her baby : the crude doctor attending to her birth says the baby won’t survive, but Hilde is determined, and it lives, and thrives.
This little group of rebels, all thinking they will change the world, swim in the lake, and picnic under the trees. Learning the Morse code, trying to send messages to Moscow ( we learn, in the end, how only one harmless message finds its way to its destination), making love, all seem of a piece, and when the brutal reality dawns upon them, it is too late.
That there was resistance to the growing power of Hitler and its anti-semitism, from within its own ranks, is not a well-known fact. ‘From Hilde, With Love’ shows us that facet, and it feels like a missing piece falling into place.
A very different film, Mati Diop’s ‘Dahomey’, brings to the fore a similar feeling of connecting the dots when 26 stolen objects were sent back from Paris to Benin in 2021, 61 years after the African country gained independence from France.Advertisement
Read | Indian entries Kottukaali, The Fable make a splash, leave audience pondering
The large-scale looting of thousands of artefacts from the Kingdom of Dahomey ( as Benin used to be known), took place over a century ago. Now with their return, it would appear to be a restitution, and a closure, but the low numbers are ‘humiliating’, said the French-Senegalese director at the press conference after the screening.
The 67 minutes film uses a unique documentary approach laced with fantasy, as one of the artefacts — a mighty statue of King Ghezo packed carefully within a container — suddenly finds a human voice. Why was he in darkness all these years? There’s joy and pride at the return of these items, but there’s also the sorrow that comes from being uprooted, and taken away to an alien land.
‘Dahomey’ powerfully challenges post-colonial notions of reparations and repair: as a young woman says, ‘I speak French, but I am not French’. What does it mean to not have access to the language of your ancestors? Memories and history go hand in hand.",entertainmaent
Vanangaan teaser: Arun Vijay fits well in Bala’s universe of realism and violence,"Director Bala is back with the teaser of his upcoming film Vanangaan, which features a typical ‘Bala hero’. With discolored hair and an ever-irritated face, Arun Vijay is perfectly in sync with the world of the director which is realistic.
A key difference in Vanangaan is that there is a conscious effort to make the cinematography look superior in comparison to his previous ventures, which looked raw and rustic.

"Shark Tank India 3: Despite catching Aman Gupta’s attention, car-washing company fails to crack a deal; Anupam Mittal asks them to revamp their business model","Even after almost a month of its premiere, business reality show Shark Tank India Season 3 continues to grip the interest of viewers. So far, varied pitches have come in and the ‘sharks’ have even made some amazing investments, but one such pitcher recently failed to seal the deal. Despite impressing some ‘sharks’, especially Aman Gupta, pitchers of Hoora, a car washing app, had to return without an investment.
Initially, Aman was able to relate to the Nagpur-based company’s work pattern, and what also impressed him was how the founders helped partners make a double income through this platform. However, the business idea did not seem very scalable or profitable to any of the ‘sharks’. The first one to back out from the deal was Anupam Mittal, who advised the pitchers to revamp their business. He asked them to focus more on clean energy and not on the services they currently offer as this stream of business was quite commoditized.

While Namita Thapar pointed out that the pitchers had made their business very complex, Vineeta Singh highlighted scalability as a concern as she backed out. Amit Jain (CEO of CarDekho) shared he was very keen to invest, but did not understand the pitch from a business mindset.

On TV, unfortunately, there are certain restrictions you have to abide by. OTT breaks those norms. I feel OTT is the future. Unfortunately, we give credibility to certain platforms, and that norm should completely change. As an actor, there have been times where it must have come to my head, that I wish to work on a particular OTT channel, but that is not because they have better content, but because sometimes I have felt, that despite doing a good show, it has not reached the masses.

"Kiran Rao says it bothers her when people recognise her as Aamir Khan’s ex-wife, says she is protective of him: ‘I do feel connected to his success, failures’","Filmmaker Kiran Rao has shared her thoughts on being primarily recognised as Aamir Khan’s wife despite her own accomplishments. Rao admitted that initially, it was challenging for her to be seen solely through that lens. Kiran also opened up about her emotional connection with Aamir and said that she feels protective of the actor.
In an interview with SoSouth, Kiran said that she was fairly independent and had her own life when she married Aamir. She explained that it didn’t take her much time to realise that people’s perceptions of her could either bother her or not, and ultimately, it didn’t affect her.
She said, “So honestly it doesn’t bother me. I do have to say at airports or any public place when people come to me and say, ‘You are…’ and they expect me to complete it and say, ‘I am Kiran Rao, Aamir Khan’s wife.’ I mean ex-wife. That bothers me because people kind of recognise me sometimes and they’re not sure but they know me through Aamir. That’s very annoying.”Advertisement

Addressing the pressure she sometimes feels due to her association with Aamir, Rao discussed her sense of responsibility towards him. Having worked closely together for the past 15 years, she feels protective of him and celebrates his achievements. Rao explained that anyone close to a family member would naturally be affected by their successes or failures.

While Rao admitted to feeling emotionally connected to Aamir Khan’s journey, she clarified that this connection doesn’t necessarily burden her. She added, “I do feel connected to his achievements or his failures. I don’t think it pressures me so much. It’s just, in that sense, maybe emotionally something that I will continue to have for him, you know, a connection with him.”
Aamir and Kiran announced their divorce in 2021, after almost 15 years of marriage. They continue to co-parent son Azad Rao.

"Prithviraj gets emotional talking about mother Mallika; recalls the day his father died: ‘At that moment, I had only one question on my mind…’","Veteran Malayalam actor Mallika Sukumaran has been part of the film industry for five decades now, and an event, Mallika Vasantham @ 50, was organised at a hotel in Thiruvananthapuram on Sunday to mark her 50th year in cinema.
The event was attended by her sons, actors Prithviraj Sukumaran and Indrajith Sukumaran, as well as her daughter-in-law, actor Poornima Indrajith, among others. During the event, a visibly moved Prithviraj praised Mallika as the “strongest woman I have ever seen”.

“To survive in cinema for 50 years is nothing short of a wonder. Though she took a break in between for almost 25 years and confined herself to the role of a housewife, she managed to provide her career a seamless restart once she returned to the industry. It’s an absolute tribute to the artiste that she is,” Prithviraj said, moving Mallika to tears.Advertisement
He also boasted that he might be the only person in the world to have received the opportunity to act alongside his mother and produce and direct the movies she was a part of. “I am very proud that I received such opportunities. Every time I act with her or direct her, I come to the realisation that she’s the most talented actor and artiste in our family. She has a lot more to offer to cinema.”

Recalling an instance from his childhood when his father, legendary actor Sukumaran, passed away, a visibly emotional Prithviraj said, “We were going to Thiruvananthapuram from Ernakulam with our father’s mortal remains. My mother was alone in another vehicle, while my brother and I were with dad in an ambulance.
“At that moment, I had only one question on my mind: ‘What will my mother do now?’ The answer to that question is right in front of you in the form of my brother and me,” he added with a lump in his throat.

While Swift bagged four trophies — female artist, pop artist, concert tour and social celebrity, Kelce took home athlete of the year award.
Jennifer Aniston roots for Adam Sandler
The 55-year-old actress may have given the red carpet a miss, she still managed to steal the show at 2024 People’s Choice Awards with a dazzling appearance, on Sunday night. The Horrible Bosses actress turned heads on stage in a timeless strapless black dress as she presented her friend Adam with the award.Advertisement
As Adam got up from his chair, Jennifer interrupted, “No, sit down, Adam, I’m not done! Sit down! Eager to get up here! I love you.” She then said, “I mean, the Sand Man. Who’s more iconic than Adam Sandler, seriously?” Jennifer asked, making the crowd cheer on the actor. Her subsequent walk down memory lane, from the Uncut Gem actor’s Saturday Night Live  (SNL) beginnings to his diverse filmography, music tours, and enduring loyalty.

“And yet in all of this extraordinary success, he has stuck to his roots; he’s never strayed from the friends he’s had for 35 years and counting. He created a world where he brings them into his movies — basically getting to hang out with his buddies all day. And it doesn’t hurt that his friends happen to be some of the most talented and hilarious writers and actors out there,” said Adam’s Murder Mystery co-star.
In a career that spans over three decades, Adam’s comedic touch has made the audiences. His films, including box office successes like Grown Ups, The Longest Yard, and Hotel Transylvania, have raked in over $3 billion worldwide and become fan favourites on Netflix.Advertisement

I’m proud to honour tonight, and I’d happily keep honouring him for decades and decades to come because he deserves all the love in the world.”
A heartwarming video montage later, Jennifer proudly announced, “Please welcome the People’s Icon, Adam Sandler!” Adam, visibly touched, joined the ranks of fellow honourees like We’re The Millers actress herself, Halle Berry, Jennifer Lopez, Melissa McCarthy and Ryan Reynolds.
At the award ceremony held on Sunday and hosted by Simu Liu, in his acceptance speech,  the actor, writer and producer joked that he had mistakenly heard his agent tell him that he had earned People’s Sexiest Man Alive title. “Thank you for recognising me as the man who made our entire country the horniest this year and was by far the most-talked-about person in the bedroom,” he added.Advertisement

Yodha teaser: Sidharth Malhotra takes fight against terrorism to the sky in this high-stakes hijack drama. Watch,"The much-anticipated teaser for Sidharth Malhotra’s upcoming film, Yodha, has been unveiled. The movie features the actor in the role of a commando tasked with the daunting mission of rescuing a hijacked Air India flight. Directed by Sagar Ambre and Pushkar Ojha, the action-packed teaser of the film promises an adrenaline-fueled experience.
Yodha teaser kicks off with the customary flight announcement, urging passengers to securely fasten their seat belts due to an impending storm on the horizon. However, the situation takes a dire turn when the Indian government is alerted to the hijacking of the flight, triggered by the pilot’s transmission of the code 7500, internationally recognised as a distress signal for hijacking. Amid the chaos, the nation’s only beacon of hope emerges in the form of a commando portrayed by Sidharth Malhotra, who happens to be aboard the flight.

The teaser swiftly transitions to gripping shots of Sidharth’s character engaging in intense confrontations with the hijackers. Additionally, we catch glimpses of action sequences on ground, with Sidharth looking dapper in his combat attire while executing daring stunts.Advertisement
Yodha also features Raashi Khanna and Disha Patani in pivotal roles. While Raashi portrays a government official, the teaser offers a glimpse of Disha in an air hostess outfit.

"Express at Berlinale: Indian entries Kottukaali, The Fable make a splash, leave audience pondering","Two Indian entries are making quite a splash at the 74th Berlinale, both from young directors with a singular vision: P S Vinothraj’s ‘Kottukaali’ (The Adamant Girl) featuring Soori Muthuchamy and Anna Ben, and Raam Reddy’s ‘The Fable’, helmed by heavyweight Manoj Bajpayee, along with Deepak Dobriyal and Priyanka Bose.
‘Kottukaali’ is self-taught Vinothraj’s second feature, and makes good on the promise of his 2021 Rotterdam break-out ‘Koozhangal’ (Pebbles), a hardscrabble tale of a father-and-son trekking across a parched landscape in search of a missing element that will make them whole. ‘The Fable’ is also a sophomore feature, which comes after a long gap — Reddy’s ‘Thithi’ premiered in 2016 at the Locarno film festival, and successfully travelled the festival circuit.

Ben plays Meena, the adamant girl who refuses to say yes to a match selected by her family, her heart already given to a lower-caste man. She is instantly deemed a culprit many times over. How dare she, a mere female, behave in this manner? Not only is she disobedient, a terrible quality in a potential wife, but has had the temerity to actually fall in love. Naturally, she has to be possessed, and equally naturally, she has to be exorcised, under the watchful-cum-baleful gaze of Pandi (Muthuchamy), the would-be groom.Advertisement
The bulk of the film is spent in a ramshackle vehicle, in which the mutinous Meena and her helpless mother, her sniffy to-be sisters-in-law, a young boy, and a rooster are being ferried to the exorcist.
The tale, which beautifully entwines morality and misogyny, is leavened by lashes of humour: the vehicle needs to be kickstarted every-time it sputters to a stop for various reasons — the boy needs to pee, the accompanists on a motorcycle look for local hooch, the sick rooster needs to be revived. And in a lovely touch, a large bull which blocks the way is led away by a chit of a girl, with all the manly men standing petrified by the road-side, before the party can hit the road again.
Also Read | Express At Berlinale: All of us will die one day, but what if we could live forever?
Vinothraj’s excavation of masculinity is made powerful in the way Pandi comes across — an aggrieved, explosive ball of rage — under siege by not just Ben’s silence, but by her reaching for agency. And in the way he chooses to end the film, the director hints at a shift in the needle : will the adamant girl become pliable, or will the adamant man loosen up? The film leaves us wondering.

Reddy’s ‘The Fable’ is about a clutch of mysterious goings-on in a large, prosperous Himalayan homestead, owned by Dev (Bajpayee), who lives with his wife ( Bose), a teenage daughter, and a younger boy. The ownership clearly goes back generations, and has cast the villagers not exactly as serfs, but as those who are clearly beholden to Dev: their livelihoods depend on being able to work in the orchards.Advertisement
All seems fine on the surface, but there’s something simmering underneath, which begins as what appears to be an inconsequential fire and then bursts into a raging blaze gobbling up the hillsides.
Who could be behind the fire? Old superstitions – the hills are alive not just with the crackle of the fire, but also dark tales – come up. The estate manager (Dobriyal), who has been there for years, is as concerned as Dev, but by now, the latter seems to have changed, from a rational man to someone brimming with suspicion.
A streak of magical realism shows up in an Icarus-like figure, which swoops above the valley: do his massive wings get singed? ‘The Fable’ throws a tonal switch as it both soars and is grounded by the questions it poses: is flying strictly for birds? What is real? What is not? And ultimately, who are we? Big themes enveloped in a vivid, stunningly shot film.",entertainmaent
Ranbir Kapoor shouts at Karan Johar and Ayushmann Khurrana at Filmfare awards: ‘Behra nahi hoon main’. Watch,"It’s not often that an award show passes without any drama, and the recently organized Filmfare Awards was no exception. A viral clip from the event captured Ranbir Kapoor seemingly snubbing, Karan Johar and Ayushmann Khurrana, who were hosting the award show.
In the clip, Karan approached Ranbir for help and said, ‘Only Ranbir can do it, Ranbir will do it, Ranbir should do it; Ranbir must help us,’ directly addressing the actor. An irritated Ranbir interrupted him, delivering a line from Animal, asserting, “Sunayi de raha hai, behra nahi hoon main (I can listen, I am not deaf).” While Ranbir’s reaction appeared to convey annoyance, it was evident that this exchange was part of a scripted act orchestrated by the trio during the award night.

It may be mentioned here that Aishwarya was previously married to cricketer Rohit Damodaran; the two got hitched in June 2021 at a subdued ceremony amid Covid-related restrictions. In October of that year, Rohit, along with four others, was booked in Puducherry after a 16-year-old girl accused them of sexual harassment, as reported by The New Indian Express. All of them were booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The media house also mentioned that his father, cricket coach Damodaran, who is secretary of the club Thamarai Kannan, was also named in the complaint lodged by the survivor.
Subsequent reports indicated that Aishwarya and Rohit initiated divorce proceedings, although no further updates have surfaced since then. Aishwarya, a doctor, is the eldest child of Shankar and his wife Easwari Shankar.",entertainmaent
Raveena Tandon reveals daughter Rasha asked her to delete her ‘looking like a wow’ reel: ‘But when Deepika Padukone made it…’,"While Raveena Tandon carved her niche as one of the leading actors of the 90s, she’s been garnering attention lately for her impactful roles in web series. In addition to captivating her audience with her on-screen performances, she keeps them entertained with her engaging Instagram presence. However, in a recent interview, Raveena disclosed that her daughter, Rasha Thadani, finds her Instagram content cringeworthy.
Speaking to News18, she said, “I’m such a dud when it comes to Instagram and I don’t know anything about it. I make these really serious and horrible mistakes. When my team tells me to post reels, I choose a funny one. I’m an actor and not an influencer. But I love the way influencers actually create content. Unlike us, they’ve a knack for it. So, sometimes, I bum reels from influencers and piggyback on them. But Rasha always tells me, ‘Mumma, you cannot be making these reels, it’s cringe!’ But I love it (laughs).”
Undeterred by her daughter’s critique, Raveena believes her Instagram game is spot-on as she was among the first people to do the ‘so beautiful, so elegant, just looking like a wow’ trend that went viral. Sharing Rasha’s reaction on the same, Raveena said, “I was the first person in the industry to make the reel on it. My daughter just freaked out and called it cringe. She, in fact, told me to delete it from my account.”Advertisement
Raveena, however, couldn’t resist a moment of triumph when Deepika Padukone later joined the same viral trend. She said, “After that when Deepika (Padukone) made a reel on it, I sent it to Rasha and told her, ‘See, everyone’s making it! Just because Deepika made it, it’s a rage. And when I had made it, it was cringe?’ I keep fighting with Rasha on my social media aesthetics. I enjoy making these funny reels and I do it only once in a while if I really like something. I don’t do it for the heck of it. When I see something and fall off the floor laughing, I know that abb yeh toh banaana hi hai!”

"Amitabh Bachchan shares snapshots from Sunday ‘spent in isolation’, focuses on fans outside Jalsa: ‘Yeh nahi hai toh…’","For megastar Amitabh Bachchan’s fans, the ‘Sunday darshans’ remain the most anticipated day of their week, as thousands of them throng outside Jalsa for Big B’s darshan. Despite his busy schedule and work commitments, the legendary actor has never failed, for years, to dedicate time to his loyal fans as he appears outside his residence in Juhu every Sunday. This Sunday was no exception. On Monday, the Amar Akbar Anthony star, in an emotional note penned on his blog, thanked his fans for this weekly ritual, who have been gathering outside his house just to catch a glimpse for years.
He also shared a video on X featuring a sea of people — young and old — eagerly waiting for their superstar to appear at his doorstep and wave at them. “T 4825 – Yeh nahi hai toh kuch nahi hai (There’s nothing if this isn’t there),” the 81-year-old actor captioned the heartwarming video. The video shows Amitabh flashing a warm smile, beaming with happiness and folding his hands in a namaste as he acknowledges the cheers and signs their artworks and posters.
Giving a peek into this customary Sunday meet-and-greet with his fans, Big B shared a series of heart-touching photos on his blog accompanied by a long emotional note, expressing his gratitude for the love he has received from his fans over the decades. “Each day is a scheduled presence of what the next few minutes are to be accomplished, adhered to, to prepare and look ahead… and when it does not occur… the desolation of emptiness and waste… so much so that the soft regularity of the deployed schedule gets avoided because the body and mind do not synchronize with each other… (sic)” wrote the Paa actor.Advertisement

Reflecting on the excess of everything materialistic that human beings desire—consumption, ambition, behaviour, indulgence, obsession, etc —he underscored that it leads to mental and physical health issues. He stressed the need for striking a balance between sufficiency and excess for sustainability and well-being. “Society must reassess its values, promoting moderation and mindful choices to mitigate the adverse effects of unchecked excess on the environment, economy, and individual lives,” he penned, adding, “and the sudden wonder… ‘do you really need this?’… is it essential to be in the category of material abundance… life shall draw close to its natural end… but the excess shall ever be left behind, unauthored, uncared for, and unused… love forever (sic).”

"Vikrant Massey calls out unprofessional Bollywood actors whose priority is to make reels, lauds Farhan Akhtar: ‘If he can do his homework…’","While Vikrant Massey has recently become the talk of the town following the widespread acclaim of his film 12th Fail, the actor has been a part of the industry for quite a while. Vikrant started his career in TV before transitioning to films. Throughout his journey in showbiz, Massey has collaborated with a diverse array of actors. In a recent interview, Vikrant spoke about how he often comes across unprofessional, insincere actors who focus on making reels on set instead of concentrating on the job.
Speaking to Samdish Bhatia, he said, “We see it very often. Some actors come on set and their first priority is to make reels. I won’t drop their name but that person knows and that person got to know about it there and then so my purpose was solved at that time. I say things on the face and I don’t have anything apart from my work. I love my job and acting is everything for me.”
Giving an example of Farhan Akhtar and how one should aspire to be like him, Vikrant said, “I would like to take an example of Farhan Akhtar. I am really inspired by him. What does he not have in life? He is the son of Javed Akhtar. On Dil Dhadakne Do set, he was acting, he was also the producer, his sister Zoya Akhtar was making the film, but when he would come for rehearsals, he never carried the script in his hand. He remembered all his lines and lines of other people. If a person like Farhan Akhtar can do his homework then you should be ashamed.”

While snubbing Barbie in the Oscars’ nominees has been a topic of discussion for over several weeks, Matthew, who was loved as Chandler Bing in the American sitcom, receiving a heartfelt tribute at the 2023 Emmy Awards’ In Memoriam segment, left many teary-eyed. ​Charlie Puth and singer-songwriter duo The War and Treaty performed a cover of the F.R.I.E.N.D.S theme song, I’ll Be There for You by The Rembrandts. Matthew, 54, breathed his last in October 2023.

Barbie cast leaves empty handed
As Oppenheimer swept away all major awards, Barbie, one of the biggest blockbusters of last year, was nominated for Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor and Best Original Screenplay along with a few other design awards, but the award ceremony, held on Sunday, ensured that the makers and the cast of the Greta Gerwig directorial walked home empty-handed. In fact, Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon lost all nine of its nominations while Maestro was snubbed too despite seven nominations.
Barbie actress Margot Robbie  lost out the BAFTA to Emma Stone who won Leading Actress for her performance in Poor Things.Advertisement
Looks like BAFTA, this year, has ruffled many feathers by dismissing many talents.  In January, actress Kate Beckinsale expressed her frustration online after learning BAFTA couldn’t guarantee if her stepfather, director Roy Battersby, would be included in the In Memoriam segment at the awards ceremony following his death. The academy subsequently assured that Roy will be honoured during their upcoming television awards.

"Kottukaali, The Fable: Indian entries from young directors leave audience pondering","Two Indian entries are making quite a splash at the 74th Berlinale, both from young directors with a singular vision: P S Vinothraj’s ‘Kottukaali’ (The Adamant Girl) featuring Soori Muthuchamy and Anna Ben, and Raam Reddy’s ‘The Fable’, helmed by heavyweight Manoj Bajpayee, along with Deepak Dobriyal and Priyanka Bose.
‘Kottukaali’ is self-taught Vinothraj’s second feature, and makes good on the promise of his 2021 Rotterdam break-out ‘Koozhangal’ (Pebbles), a hardscrabble tale of a father-and-son trekking across a parched landscape in search of a missing element that will make them whole. ‘The Fable’ is also a sophomore feature, which comes after a long gap — Reddy’s ‘Thithi’ premiered in 2016 at the Locarno film festival.
Ben plays Meena, the adamant girl who refuses to say yes to a match selected by her family, her heart already given to a lower-caste man. She is instantly deemed a culprit many times over. How dare she, a mere female, behave in this manner? Not only is she disobedient, a terrible quality in a potential wife, but has had the temerity to actually fall in love. Naturally, she has to be possessed, and equally naturally, she has to be exorcised, under the watchful-cum-baleful gaze of Pandi (Muthuchamy), the would-be groom.Advertisement
The bulk of the film is spent in a ramshackle vehicle, in which the mutinous Meena and her helpless mother, her sniffy to-be sisters-in-law, a young boy, and a rooster are being ferried to the exorcist.
The tale, which beautifully entwines morality and misogyny, is leavened by lashes of humour: the vehicle needs to be kickstarted every-time it sputters to a stop for various reasons — the boy needs to pee, the accompanists on a motorcycle look for local hooch, the sick rooster needs to be revived. And in a lovely touch, a large bull which blocks the way is led away by a chit of a girl, with all the manly men standing petrified by the road-side, before the party can hit the road again.
Vinothraj’s excavation of masculinity is made powerful in the way Pandi comes across — an aggrieved, explosive ball of rage — under siege by not just Ben’s silence, but by her reaching for agency. And in the way he chooses to end the film, the director hints at a shift in the needle : will the adamant girl become pliable, or will the adamant man loosen up? The film leaves us wondering.
Reddy’s ‘The Fable’ is about a clutch of mysterious goings-on in a large, prosperous Himalayan homestead, owned by Dev (Bajpayee), who lives with his wife ( Bose), a teenage daughter, and a younger boy. The ownership clearly goes back generations, and has cast the villagers not exactly as serfs, but as those who are clearly beholden to Dev: their livelihoods depend on being able to work in the orchards.Advertisement
All seems fine on the surface, but there’s something simmering underneath, which begins as what appears to be an inconsequential fire and then bursts into a raging blaze gobbling up the hillsides.
Who could be behind the fire? Old superstitions – the hills are alive not just with the crackle of the fire, but also dark tales – come up. The estate manager (Dobriyal), who has been there for years, is as concerned as Dev, but by now, the latter seems to have changed, from a rational man to someone brimming with suspicion.
A streak of magical realism shows up in an Icarus-like figure, which swoops above the valley: do his massive wings get singed? ‘The Fable’ throws a tonal switch as it both soars and is grounded by the questions it poses : is flying strictly for birds? What is real? What is not? And ultimately, who are we?

While actor David Tennant will host the award event, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is a front-runner with 13 nominations, the highest of any film this year. The film is also expected to win a record number of awards, with many expecting it to emerge as the most awarded film in the history of the event.

The actor who will be next seen in Disney Plus Hotstar’s Showtime revealed that he has stopped watching movies and does not like the films that are being made and added that he feels ‘disappointed’ to see how people take pride in Hindi cinema being a 100-years-old.

Pointing out that there is no solution if people keep watching these kinds of movies, he advised ‘serious filmmakers’ to responsibly show today’s reality in a way that they don’t get in trouble with ED or have any fatwas coming their way.
“There is hope for Hindi cinema only if we stop seeing them as a means to make money. But I feel it’s too late now. There is no solution any more because the films that are being watched by thousands will keep being produced and people will keep watching them, God knows till when. So those who want to make serious films, it’s their responsibility to show today’s reality and in such a way that they don’t get a fatwa, or the ED doesn’t come knocking on their doors,” Shah said.
In 2023, Naseeruddin Shah delivered some great performances in Kuttey, Taj: Divided By Blood, and Saas, Bahu, Aur Flamingo. This year, he will be seen in the web show Showtime.

Dangal actor Suhani Bhatnagar’s mother breaks down remembering her: ‘We thought it was just a skin disease…’,"Dangal actress Suhani Bhatnagar passed away on Friday evening in Delhi. While she succumbed to an immunity disorder, her demise left many of her co-stars in shock. 19-year-old Suhani had starred in Aamir Khan’s Dangal in the role of jr Babita Phogat. Grieving this great loss, Suhani’s mother got emotional as she spoke to ANI and remembered how her late daughter brought them recognition in society.
Talking to ANI, Suhani’s mother Pooja said, “Har parent proud feel karta hai ki woh apne bache ke naam se jana jata hai. Hamari kya identity thi? Hume jo recognition mila hai woh to Suhani ki wajah se hi mila hai, ki ye ‘Dangal girl ke parents hain’, jahan bhi jana ho uski recognition hoti thi… har ek ko apna bacha bahut acha lagta hai par hamara bacha hume bahut proud feel kara ke gaya hai (Every parent feels proud of their child.

"Shark Tank India 3: Pitchers offer Toilet Ek Prem Katha story for waterless urinals, but judges sniff a problem","Sanitation, love and profit — the latest episode of Shark Tank India 3 featured a cocktail of emotions as two pitchers came up with a product about urinals, which was strangely similar to the story of Akshay Kumar-Bhumi Pednekar starrer Toilet Ek Prem Katha.
Sachin Joshi and Uttam Banerjee, founders of Zerodor–waterless urinal– featured on the episode. The duo said they try to provide “CPR” to the sanitation system with their products and solutions. They said CPR for them means ‘Conserve, Protect and Restore’.

Uttam said the product was birthed after his marriage. Hailing from a village in Jharkhand, the pitcher said there was no washroom in his village– something which became a reason for his wife to not visit the place. When he reached his village, the magnitude of the problem hit him, so he quit his job to work towards sanitation.Advertisement
The founders said they had so far installed 30,000 units installed, saved more than 100 crore plus liters of water and had more than 700 clients in the roster since they started in 2013. The market size  for this, the duo claimed, was more than Rs 16,000 crores. Of course, the numbers and even the intent behind the product impressed the judges, but then came the big profit talk. Their ask was Rs 1 crore against 3% equity in the company.

The founders said in 2017-18 they had sales worth Rs 1.96 cr, followed by Rs 2.1 cr, then Rs 1.6 cr in the lockdown, back to Rs 2.1 cr and last year Rs 2.8 cr. Total nett profit last year was Rs 18 lakhs.
Something which caught the eye of Radhika Gupta,  MD and CEO of Edelweiss Mutual Fund, was the slow rate of profit growth. “The market potential for waterless urinal wasn’t that much when we started, there was no awareness. In maximum cases, the philosophy of saving water is not there in people,” Uttam said.
But that didn’t impress the sharks much. Vineeta Singh said she was out as she could sniff a problem. “If you have taken Rs 2 cr from an investor and it is now seven years, surely there is something amiss?” Aman Gupta also bowed out and said, “No prem for me in this Toilet ek prem katha.”Advertisement
Peyush Bansal said he was willing to give them Rs 1 cr, but on one condition — Zerodor will focus only on waterless urinals and hire a person to leads sales. It was an offer, however, which the founders refused.

"‘Vidhu Vinod Chopra inspired Virus’ character in 3 Idiots, takes afternoon naps, has 5-star chefs at home’: Vikrant Massey","After witnessing the astounding success of his last film 12th Fail, actor Vikrant Massey has been ruling many hearts.

He walks faster than me. The food you get at his house is outstanding he has 5-star chefs at home. From what I have known, for the last 30 years, Vidhu Vinod Chopra has to take an afternoon nap. Lately, he has started listening to a podcast that is 28 minutes long and wherever he is in the world, he follows the circadian cycle. Viru Sahastra Buddhe is inspired by Vidhu Vinod Chopra.

Not all comments were positive, though, as a section also started questioning her over her apparent “new” look and claiming that she had gone under the knife and some changes to her face. The insensitive remarks also trickled into her private Instagram profile, leading her to turn off the comment section.Advertisement
On Sunday, Ayesha Takia posted a note and slammed those who were trying to shame her. The actor says she was papped when she was rushing to Goa due to a medical emergency in her family–her sister is in the hospital– and was stopped by the paps, obliging them as she posed for “a few seconds” before flying off.

Literally get over me yaar, I have zero interest in doing any films or any comeback like people are saying. I’m living my life happily, never want to be in the limelight, not interested in any fame, don’t wanna be in any film…So chill.
“Please feel free to not care about me at all. Expecting a girl whose mostly been seen in her teens to look identical even after 15 years…How unrealistic and ridiculous are these people…Lol,” a section of her note read.

Do better people, get a hobby, eat a fun meal, talk to your friend, smile, whatever it takes to not feel so unhappy that you need to tell a gorgeous happy woman how she’s not looking like you wanted,” she wrote.

Sushmita recounted how they arranged for her to meet an etiquette teacher from San Francisco. Together, they practised various aspects of etiquette, including dining etiquette. One particularly valuable lesson that stuck with Sushmita was her teacher’s advice to “eat before going out and then carry oneself with grace while dining.”
She shared, “One of the things I learnt from her was, ‘Pet bhar kar kha kar jaao ghar se (Eat well at home and then go for an official dinner), so that you do not have the urge to eat at the dinner table and you can elegantly say, ‘No more, thank you’, and they will assume you follow a strict diet.”
Sushmita was recently seen in the third season of the hit Disney Plus Hotstar series Aarya.

Suhani Bhatnagar’s mother says Aamir Khan would have ‘immediately’ been there had he known about her illness: ‘He was always in touch’,"Dangal actor Suhani Bhatnagar, who was seen in the Aamir Khan film as Jr. Babita Phogat, passed away on Friday.

The young actress succumbed to the illness after fluid accumulated in her lungs. Her death shocked her Dangal co-stars.

During the conversation, Suhani’s mother also shared that Aamir had invited them to his daughter Ira Khan’s wedding. While talking to E24, Suhani’s mother Pooja said, “Aamir Sir has always been in touch with her. He is a nice person. We never shared this with him. We didn’t inform anyone. We were so disturbed by this. If we had messaged him, he would have immediately been there for us. Even during his daughter’s wedding, he invited us. And in fact, he called us to be a part of his big day.”

Vikrant Massey remembers taking ‘pocket money’ from then-girlfriend Sheetal for film auditions: ‘I left a Rs 35 lakh per month contract for…’,"Transitioning from television to films is no easy feat, but actors like Vikrant Massey make it seem effortless. Last year, his film 12th Fail surprised everyone with its success at the box office, earning accolades from across the film industry. In a recent interview with Unfiltered by Samdish, Vikrant opened up about his journey from TV to films and the decision to leave behind a lucrative acting job in television, which paid him Rs 35 lakh per month, to pursue a career in cinema.
Speaking about the same in an interview with Unfiltered by Samdish, Vikrant said, “I earned a lot in TV. I bought my first house at the age of 24. But all that regressive content on TV was happening simultaneously and I felt like coming out of the world and try my luck in cinema. I realised that though I became secure financially, it didn’t help me sleep well. I had this realisation when I fulfilled all my financial responsibilities towards my parents and other.”
Sharing his parents’ reaction when he decided to leave TV, the actor said, “My parents were in shock when I told them I am going to restart over in films. I was making a lot of money. At the age of 24, I was earning Rs 35 lakh per month, especially for someone who comes from a middle-class background. I quit TV at the time when I had a Rs 35 lakh per month contract in my hand. I decided to do good work and find peace. My savings got exhausted in a year and then my wife Sheetal (his girlfriend at the time) used to give me pocket money for auditions.”

"Vikrant Massey says he left TV as it became misogynistic, reveals fighting with executives: ‘People with MBA made a fool out of us’","There is a reason Vikrant Massey left TV: It became repetitive with misogynistic content eventually taking over. The actor, who shot to fame with Balika Vadhu, said many “weird things” started to happen on TV sets, because of which he had to put his foot down.
On Balika Vadhu, Vikrant played Shyam Singh and became a household name. During an interview on Unfiltered by Samdish, Vikrant was asked what has been the weirdest day for him on a TV set.
“There were many, which were happening repetitively, which is why I left TV. Universally, everyone was doing the same thing. Be it any field, when a certain thing works, only its versions are then replicated. So on TV when misogynistic content worked, which included bahu pe atyavchaar, there were takers as well so people were making just that for TRP,” Vikrant said.Advertisement

The actor recalled how he did TV for ten years–he started acting at the age of 17–.but eventually realised how things weren’t falling into place. “On TV, a lot of irritating things would happen, like MBAs calling the shots on stories. They would say, ‘Make only these kinds of episodes for rating, as per our internal research.’
“They really made a fool out of many by saying this ‘internal research’ and asking for a ‘maha episode’, which would be of one hour. After a point, I fought with them and said I won’t do it.”

The actor said he put his foot down as something within him was “churning” and he felt “under-utilised” as an actor. “I thought I can do a lot more, but they are not able to utilise me. My contract in Balika Vadhu was just for two months, it was a cameo. But people loved it so much it went on for two years. I did it for that long because I believed in the content I was doing. But after that maza nahi aaya kuch shows mein.” Vikrant also revealed working non-stop for 110 hours “without sleeping” while he was doing a TV show.
Vikrant ended the conversation by saying that the TV industry, with its working hours and 90-day payment cycle, is “exploitative” in nature. The actor was recently seen in 12th Fail. The Vidhu Vinod Chopra directorial, which was released last year to acclaim, emerged as a surprise hit of 2023.

"When Esha Deol remarried Bharat Takhtani five years after marriage, said, ‘We have become as thick as thieves’","Rumours of Esha Deol and Bharat Takhtani’s separation began swirling after the latter missed his mother-in-law Hema Malini’s 75th birthday celebration, which saw many Bollywood stars in attendance.

Despite the current challenges Esha and Bharat face, their relationship wasn’t always strained. In a previous interview, Esha described them as being ‘thick as thieves’ and praised Bharat for his unwavering support during her pregnancy.
Esha and Bharat exchanged vows on June 29, 2012. In 2017, during Esha’s godh bharai ceremony, they remarried following Sindhi tradition, with Esha pregnant with their first daughter Radhya. In a 2017  interview with Mumbai Mirror, Esha spoke fondly of their bond, stating, “Over the last five years, Bharat and I have become as thick as thieves. Since I’m pregnant, I’m prone to mood swings now but he’s tolerated them and is extremely protective. He’s also my best critic, encouraging me in everything I do. At the risk of sounding filmi, I’ll say I wouldn’t want to change anything, life is beautiful!”
Reflecting on their remarriage, she mentioned, “This time it’s a Sindhi priest who speaks Hindi too, so my in-laws will at least understand what is being said.”Advertisement

On February 6, 2024, Esha and Bharat issued a joint statement to Delhi Times, announcing their separation. It reads, “We have mutually and amicably decided to part ways. Through this shift in our lives, the best interests and welfare of our two children is and will be of utmost importance to us. We’d appreciate our privacy is respected.”

Shark Tank pitcher Priyasha Saluja reveals how much interaction happens with ‘sharks’ after cracking a deal: ‘It depends…’,"Episodes end, equations last. Shark Tank India pitcher Priyasha Saluja, from The Cinnamon Kitchen, says she met businessman Deepinder Goyal, who is one of the judges on the show, after the show and described it as a “nice” experience. She also shared how much interaction happens between her and Aman Gupta who offered her a deal on the show. Aman offered Rs 60 lakh for a 5% equity stake in The Cinnamon Kitchen, and the deal was struck.
In episode two of season three, Priyasha Saluja pitched her business and took Deepinder Goyal’s (CEO, Zomato) contact number on the show. During the podcast of Ayushman Pandita, the pitcher was asked if she met any of the judges after the show.

“I met Deepinder after Shark Tank and it was a very nice experience. All these people are really smart, they have built million billion dollars company from scratch. There is so much to learn.”Advertisement
Priyasha Saluja said Deepinder is one of the most humble people that she has come across and revealed he had invited her to a Diwali party. “It was a very informal environment where a lot of his colleagues, work people, friends were there. I also feel that as business owners, when you have made everything out of scratch, people from the outside can view you and think you would have a certain air about you because you have gained so much. The one thing entrepreneurship really does is that it grounds you.”

When asked if she has met Aman Gupta, she said, “Not yet. We are in touch on WhatsApp, we keep sharing business insights and whatever growth is happening. The team also gets in touch, asks for finances, how it’s doing and all of that.”
On being quizzed about how much ‘Sharks’ truly interact with contestants after the show or if it’s only their team who stays in touch, Priyasha said it is a mix of both and there isn’t any “correct” answer to it.
“If the team can help you more, you will interact with them more frequently. It is not that value addition happens only when you talk to the founder. If I am doing business, I know people who are better in business development, graphics or social media than I am. So, I will not insist that only I will guide, I will connect them with the right person. So it isn’t that the team is bringing lesser value,” she added.

Udaariyan producer Sargun Mehta denies claims of Bigg Boss 17’s Abhishek Kumar being thrown out of show due to anger issues: ‘He had so much innocence…’,"Bigg Boss 17 fame Abhishek Kumar might not have won the reality show, but he has won many hearts. While his journey on Bigg Boss was tough, with his ex-Isha Malviya also coming on the show as a contestant, what made it tougher were the accusations made against Abhishek. One such allegation was that Abhishek was thrown out of the TV show Udaariyan due to his anger issues. But now, the show’s producer producer Sargun Mehta has denied the claims.
Praising Abhishek, Sargun told Siddharth Kannan, “It’s not like that, Abhishek was going through a really tough time back then. He and Isha were having whatever issues they had, we are nobody to get into somebody’s personal life, but the track had to end when it did. It came at a time when people thought this might be the reason, but it’s not true. If this would have been the case, we would have spoken to him. Abhishek was such a nice kid when I auditioned him for the first time…I saw him on Instagram and messaged him asking if he would do the role. Everybody in Udaariyaan was new except for Ankit Gupta, and Priyanka Chahar Choudhary had not done a lead role.”
Sargun also shared an interesting anecdote, revealing that Abhishek was the first actor to get cast. She said, “When Priyanka came on set she thought what kind of a show we are making that we took her as a lead. She said that to me so many times. Isha was also scared that she didn’t know much, except for Abhishek. We locked him very long back, when no one from Priyanka, or Ankit was also cast. He was the first guy to be locked. He would call us every weekend asking if he was replaced. He had so much innocence, he wanted to work.”

When he came for the mock shoot, I realised he would do great. So when we started the show, he was being used like 20-25 days a month. He was so good that we dragged him in a lot of more scenes.”Advertisement

Sargun even commented on claims that Isha Malviya made about Udaariyan co-stars being jealous of her. She said, “When we were in our 20s and would get so much media attention, sometimes we would say the right things and sometimes the wrong things. We wouldn’t know what was said. So Isha’s claims are not something to feel bad about, she is a very nice girl. She has worked very hard on Udaariyaan. We all have given our best to the show. They have done a lot of good for the show, to us, and the channel.”
Earlier in an interview with us, Abhishek had also spoken about his relationship with Isha and how he has gotten over her now.
Watch the interview here:

On the work front, Abhishek will soon be seen in a music video with Mannara Chopra. He is also rumoured to be a part of Khatron Ke Khiladi 14. Sargun, on the other hand, will be seen starring in the Punjabi film Jatt Nuu Chudail Takri, with Gippy Grewal and Roopi Gill.",entertainmaent
"Sargun Mehta defends Sandeep Reddy Vanga on misogyny in Animal, says if people want to learn lessons from films, ‘Let’s shut down schools’","Filmmaker Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s latest project, Animal, featured Ranbir Kapoor’s character Ranvijay seeking assistance from his cousins in Punjab to confront his enemies. Recently, actor Sargun Mehta, who predominantly works in the Punjabi film industry, took notice of Vanga’s depiction of Sikh characters in the film and praised his attention to detail. In a new interview, Sargun commended the filmmaker for his portrayal of Punjabi characters, highlighting their dignified killing in the film.
Speaking to Siddharth Kannan about Animal, Sargun said, “The moment I stepped out of Animal, I said he (Sandeep) didn’t kill any of the Punjabi guys with their heads bowed and their eyes lowered. This is Sandeep’s speciality. You would have noticed that whenever a Sardar was shot in the film, they were standing tall with their chest puffed up. The bullets didn’t hit the man from the back or in the head, but they were hit right at the chest.”
She added, “Even in the last shot that he had of the Animal Park, the last Sardar who gets killed, he looks straight into the eyes of the guy who is about to kill him. There is no fear in his eyes. So, Sandeep knew that the guys who were singing ‘Arjan Vailly’…he is talking about valour, he can’t kill these men just like that. He has done his research. He hasn’t just made a film that made Rs 1000 crore. He didn’t leave anything. It was so well done.”Advertisement
Also read | Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Animal is clearly a clickbait but will its lifespan match its hype?
Sargun also shared her take on the film’s misogynistic tone. She said, “People often say, ‘What will your film teach us?’ Now we have to decide whether all the lessons have to be learned only through films and if this is the case, let’s shut down schools. The idea of cinema is to show what is existing in some part of this world. There is somebody like the character of Animal in our world also.”
She added, “I feel that Sandeep pulled me in his world saying this is a man who is doing all these things and I found Ranbir’s character wrong also, Sandeep didn’t whitewash his mistakes. But I also saw the character who was so flawed that he got up despite making so many mistakes. He is like that. He is that passionate. I also can’t hear anything wrong being said to women, I myself have slapped so many men. I know when to raise my hand and when not. But equality isn’t that I speak about it everywhere…some things are for entertainment and I saw it like that.”
Despite Animal enjoying substantial success at the box office, grossing Rs 917.82 crore worldwide, the film garnered mixed reviews from audiences. While some praised its narrative, others criticised its excessive violence and misogynistic theme. Alongside Ranbir Kapoor, the film featured Anil Kapoor, Rashmika Mandanna, Sunny Deol, and Tripti Dimri in pivotal roles.

"Stars, royalty and a ‘Poppenheimer’ showdown: Here’s what to expect at BAFTA film awards","Prepare for Poppenheimer. Poor Things and Oppenheimer are the leading contenders for the British Academy Film Awards, which will be handed out Sunday in front of an audience of filmmakers, movie stars and the heir to the British throne. Yorgos Lanthimos’ gothic fantasia is up for 11 trophies, while Christopher Nolan’s atom-bomb epic has 13 nominations for the British prizes, known as BAFTAs. That’s the same number Oppenheimer has for the Oscars, where it is also the frontrunner.
The ceremony at London’s Royal Festival Hall will be a glitzy, British-accented appetiser for Hollywood’s Academy Awards, closely watched for hints about who might win at the Oscars on March 10. Nominees including Bradley Cooper, Carey Mulligan, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr, Rosamund Pike, Ryan Gosling and Ayo Edebiri are expected on the red carpet beside the River Thames, along with presenters such as Andrew Scott, Cate Blanchett, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Idris Elba.
Guest of honour will be Prince William, in his role as president of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. He’ll be without his wife Kate, who is recovering after abdominal surgery last month. The show will be hosted, with a dash of self-deprecating humour, by Doctor Who star David Tennant.

“People keep telling me I should be terribly nervous,” Tennant said about the notoriously pitfall-plagued role of awards show host. “But it’s not like I’m up for the award. I just get to hand them out.” Historical epic Killers of the Flower Moon and Holocaust drama The Zone of Interest have nine nominations each for the prizes, officially called the EE BAFTA Film Awards.Advertisement
French courtroom drama Anatomy of a Fall, boarding school comedy The Holdovers and Leonard Bernstein biopic Maestro each have seven, while grief-flecked love story “All of Us Strangers” is nominated in six categories and class-war dramedy “Saltburn” in five.
Barbie, one half of 2023’s “Barbenheimer” box office juggernaut, also has five nominations, but missed out on nods for best picture and best director. Many see the omission of Barbie director Greta Gerwig — for both BAFTAs and Oscars — as a major snub.
Britain’s film academy introduced changes to increase the awards’ diversity in 2020, when no women were nominated as best director for the seventh year running and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white. But there is only one woman among the six best-director nominees: Justine Triet for “Anatomy of a Fall”. Emerald Fennell for “Saltburn” and Celine Song for “Past Lives” also failed to make the list.

The best film race pits “Oppenheimer” against “Poor Things”, “Killers of the Flower Moon”, “Anatomy of a Fall” and “The Holdovers”.
“Poor Things” is also on the 10-strong list for the separate category of best British film, an eclectic slate that includes class-war dramedy “Saltburn”, imperial epic “Napoleon,” south London romcom “Rye Lane” and chocolatier origin story “Wonka”, among others.
A woman of colour could take the best actress BAFTA for the first time, with Fantasia Barrino for “The Color Purple” and Vivian Oparah for “Rye Lane” nominated alongside Sandra Hüller for “Anatomy of a Fall”, Mulligan for “Maestro”, Margot Robbie for “Barbie” and Emma Stone for “Poor Things.” No British performers are nominated in the best-actor category, but Ireland is represented by Cillian Murphy for “Oppenheimer” and Barry Keoghan for “Saltburn”. They’re up against Cooper for “Maestro”, Colman Domingo for “Rustin”, Paul Giamatti for “The Holdovers” and Teo Yoo for “Past Lives”.Advertisement

The announcement video featured J-Hope showcasing his moves in a super stylish outfit. The official BTS handle wrote, “<HOPE ON THE STREET> 2024. 03. COMING SOON.” 
Fans on the internet were left surprised and excited after the big announcement. One of the fans commented, “So grateful for Hobi’s planning. He worked so hard to leave us so many gifts, before he left to serve his country. I can’t wait to see.” Another wrote, “Can’t wait for the release of HOPE ON THE STREET! Excited to see what J-Hope has in store for us in 2024.”Advertisement

As fans await the release of the documentary, a few of them took a trip down the memory lane and recalled J-Hope’s previous documentary, “j-hope IN THE BOX,” released by HYBE Labels in 2023. 
Ahead of his birthday, J-hope took to his Instagram handle and shared a selfie. He also shared pictures of his birthday posters across the city and wished his fans ‘Happy hope day.’

Mukesh Rishi recalls hitting Sunny Deol’s hand with a sword during Ghatak shoot; latter’s gesture won him over: ‘I was so tensed but he…’,"Actor Mukesh Rishi, who is known for negative roles in the 90s Hindi and Telugu films, recently spoke about the time he almost injured Sunny Deol on the sets of their 1996 film Ghatak. The actor recalled how he inadvertently hit Sunny’s hand with a sword while shooting for the film. It was, however, the Gadar actor’s sweet gesture that won Mukesh’s heart.
Narrating the incident in an interview with Rajshri Unplugged, Mukesh said, “When we were shooting for Ghatak, Tillu Varma sahab was our fight master, and he used to get very rough even while explaining the scene to us and he expected us also to show the same intensity. So, in the film, there was a fight scene between me and Sunny Deol. We both were given heavy-weight swords for the fight. But during the scene, I made a mistake and I hit his hand with the sword. Immediately after the scene, lunch break was announced and I was tensed because you do these types of stunts when you trust each other.”
The actor was “beating” himself up for “losing concentration” and probably Deol knew about it. He sent a person to Mukesh to calm him down. “A person from Sunny’s team came to me and told me ‘Sunny sahab ne kaha hai I am alright (Sunny sir has said he is alright).’ I liked his gesture,” recalled Mukesh.Advertisement
Sunny Deol gifted Mukesh Rishi a gadget
Sharing another example of Sunny Deol’s generosity, Mukesh said, “One more time during the shooting of Indian, Dimple Kapadia’s younger sister Simple used to live with her. So, one day Simple ji was walking with a gadget, that would record your steps, and I just praised that gadget and asked her where she got it from. Next time when I went on the set, Sunny sahab had already bought that gadget for me and kept it aside.”

"Anupam Mittal says Shark Tank India ‘celebrityhood’ has helped him skip queues, but doesn’t get mobbed on streets: ‘Shah Rukh Khan nahi hun’","Entrepreneur Anupam Mittal feels like a star, but the stardom isn’t of the level of Shah Rukh Khan. The businessman, who became a household name as one of the judges on Shark Tank India, says being a celebrity has affected his life “hugely” and he feels privileged to be famous.
In an interview with The BarberShop with Shantanu, Anupam Mittal was asked how he feels to be a celebrity, to which the businessman said the social position comes with immense perks. He has been a judge on Shark Tank India, currently in its third season, since its first outing.
“The celebrityhood, the stardom, the name, it has affected my life hugely. It is not like I can’t walk on the streets, Shah Rukh Khan thodi na hun (I am no Shah Rukh Khan). But some places get more crowded than others. Airports and all are a big mess. If you go to an event, it becomes tough, it becomes very crowded. People also just catch you. Once I was crossing the road and there was a guy on his bike.Advertisement
“This incident happened last year, when he slowed down his bike and just grabbed my hand. I was like, ‘Boss what are you doing?’ and he told me, ‘Sir photo leni hai!’ I said, ‘Jaan thodi lega?!’ So that happens, when you go out people do recognise think that you are out of reach– that is, they don’t expect to see you. A lot of people will look twice but walk away thinking, ‘nahi ho sakta,'” he said.

Mittal said being a celebrity has “helped” him a lot and wondered what’s not to like in being popular. The entrepreneur said he doesn’t like when people, who become popular, start dissing it.
“A lot of people become famous and I find it very amusing when they complain about lack of privacy. I feel, then leave it. This comes from conditioning. We grow up being told to remain humble so you struggle with that. I also struggled with it initially. That’s the problem, but you always have a choice, you can stop doing it.

“But to continue doing it and then cry about it… But I love it. I embrace it. I don’t have to stand in queue anymore, what can be better than that? You don’t need restaurant reservations. So there are perks,” he added.Advertisement
Mittal is currently judging Shark Tank India 3 with Vineeta Singh, Aman Gupta, Peyush Bansal, Namita Thapar, and six new judges, who have joined the show in this season.

In the film, Shahid played the role of a person who pretends to be deaf and mute.

Responding to this, Shahid revealed, “In case you didn’t know, that ‘Jabba Jabba’ voice was not me. I also reacted the same way as the audience did because when I saw the film and at that time, I was a newcomer, so, you don’t get a lot of importance. He did it without telling me.”Advertisement

The actor continued, “Priyadarshan had directed the film and he used to do dubbing and all in Chennai. He took someone from there and made them do ‘Dabba Dabba’. So, when I was looking at the film, I was like ‘Who’s voice is that?’ Everyone was like ‘Oh, he’s so funny!’ But yeah ‘it’s not me!'”
Chup Chup Ke was released in 2006. The film also starred Kareena Kapoor, Neha Dhupia, Suniel Shetty, Paresh Rawal, Rajpal Yadav, Shakti Kapoor, Om Puri and Anupam Kher in pivotal roles.

"Express At Berlinale: All of us will die one day, but what if we could live forever?","Does death come as the end? And how final is that end? Poets and philosophers are not the only ones who have rhapsodised over the cyclical nature of all existence: if you are born, then one day, you will die.
Medical science has taken giant strides in being able to save lives, and is pushing boundaries in this field with each passing day. But no one yet has found a way to prevent the cessation of life.
The ‘what if’ question — what if we could live forever– is one that has seen countless iterations, but it’s been strictly rhetorical. But in movies, everything is possible, and this business of stayin’ alive is the central theme of ‘Another End’, an Italian film of intrigue and simmering power starring Gael Garcia Bernal, Renate Reinsve and Berenice Bejo.Advertisement
The film, directed by Piero Messina, is set in the near future, where a technological leap manages to place the memories of a dead person in a living body. Bernal plays a man who is unable to come to terms with the loss of his wife in an accident. His sister ( Bejo), who works with the organisation which ‘matches’ the dead person with a living body, ensures that the consciousness of the wife is ‘placed’ within the limber body of Reinsve.

The film is futuristic only to the extent of having this kind of technology available to those who desperately need it ; in every other respect, it belongs to the earth as we know it. Grieving humans, especially those whose loved ones die in an accident which they feel responsible for, always feel that they never had the time to say the things they would have, if they had known such a thing would happen.
Also read | Express At Berlinale: Iranian film My Favourite Cake is a warm, funny film about loneliness and repression
Bernal is first-rate as the partner left behind, his attempt at taking his own life thwarted. The ethical and moral dilemmas that this kind of ‘extension’ is apparent not just in his confusion while dealing with a woman who remembers the things that his wife did — they even snap at each other in familiar ways– but in the way he refuses to let go.Advertisement
Reinsve, who is having quite a Berlinale (she also stars in another Competition title ‘A Different Man’) and Bejo triangulate Bernal effectively: the former dealing with her own grief of a lost child while lending her body as a host, the latter stuck in a difficult place in trying to overcompensate a lost sibling. Bejo’s job at the organisation involves ‘matching’ and ‘allocating’, and when her brother demands ‘some more time’, she cannot help but break rules. She also knows that having access to these ‘simulations’ may feel like a fresh chance, but nothing is forever, and those left behind have to finally learn to cope with loss.
Reinsve is equally luminous in her other Competition title ‘A Different Man’, which forces us to confront our complex feelings towards disfigurement. She plays a struggling playwright, and is the neighbour of aspiring actor Edward (Sebastian Stan) who undergoes a radical procedure to ‘fix’ his face. When an actual disfigured man (Adam Pearson) gets the part Edward was ‘born to play’, questions arise: when the movies get ‘normal’ actors to play disfigured ones with the aid of prosthetics, isn’t it unfair to those who live with it? For the record, Pearson does a better job, but he would, wouldn’t he?
And can we all be like Reinsve’s blithe character, who doesn’t appear to be at all bothered by the face of her neighbour, a face he can’t wait to get rid of? Beauty does indeed lie in the eyes of the beholder.",entertainmaent

"Bramayugam box office collection Day 3: Mammootty’s horror drama stays strong, to cross Rs 10 crore mark soon","Following a robust opening, Malayalam superstar Mammootty’s latest offering, Bramayugam, continues to soar at the box office. According to Sacnilk, the film amassed an impressive Rs 3.50 crore on its first Saturday, propelling its total domestic earnings to Rs 9.05 crore.
Initially debuting with Rs 3.1 crore, the film experienced a marginal 20 percent decline in collections on its second day, garnering Rs 2.45 crore. However, its fortunes took a turn for the better on Saturday, with expectations of a strong Sunday performance. Bramayugam boasted an overall Malayalam occupancy rate of 61.23 percent on Saturday, with night screenings commanding a remarkable 74.18 percent attendance, while evening shows also attracted a substantial audience at 70.26 percent.
Comparatively, Bramayugam has outperformed Mammootty’s previous release, Kaathal – The Core, by a significant margin.

Anandu Suresh of indianexpress.com awarded the film 3.5 stars and praised its departure from conventional Malayalam horror tropes. “Unlike conventional Malayalam horror films, Bramayugam exhibits uniqueness by creating elements from scratch, avoiding clichés and traditional tactics, including in the depiction of the Yakshi (female ghost played by Amalda Liz). Rahul’s writing, combined with TD Ramakrishnan’s dialogues, is exceptionally original and effectively captures the nuances of the world without excessive explanation,” he wrote.

Dangal actor Suhani Bhatnagar’s parents open up about the cause of her death at age 19: ‘She was performing very well in college’,"Dangal actor Suhani Bhatnagar’s parents have shared details about the medical complications that led to her death at the age of 19. Best known for playing the child Babita Kumari Phogat in the blockbuster film, Suhani was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disorder, and spent over 10 days at AIIMS before succumbing to her illness. Her parents addressed the media a day after her passing.
In a recent interaction with the media, according to India Today, Suhani’s parents said that she had been diagnosed with dermatomyositis. According to her father, this rare condition was identified around two months ago, when she started experiencing swelling in her hands. The swelling later spread to other parts of her body. He said that Suhani caught a minor infection in hospital, leading to fluid accumulation in her body, including in her lungs. Despite ventilation, her oxygen levels dropped significantly. Her immune system was impacted by the steroids that she was given. Suhani’s father said, “Even after putting her on a ventilator, her oxygen level was very low, and then yesterday evening at 7 pm, the AIIMS doctors said ‘she is not more.’”

Anupam Mittal claims he starved for three days because he had no money: ‘Experiencing hunger teaches you a lot’,"Anupam Mittal is a household name now, thanks to the three years that he has spent hosting the popular reality television series Shark Tank India. Companies offer him equity for nothing in return now, but there was a time when he struggled like everybody else. Appearing on the Barbershop podcast, Anupam recalled how he got his start as an entrepreneur, and how he went from living in a cramped apartment in Mumbai to becoming a multi-millionaire in his 20s.
Anupam said that his father made his fortune in the textiles business, but there was a time when they weren’t very well off. “We wouldn’t realise it as kids, but 20 of us were living in a 1000 square foot house at the time. People were sleeping on the dining table, under the dining table. But as kids, you don’t think of that. You enjoy having so many kids around,” he said.

But in time, his father prospered, and Anupam went to the US for studies. He couldn’t find a job there though, and decided not to tell his parents because they’d command him to return to India. “Now the situation was such that I had no money, and if I asked them for money they say, ‘Where’s your salary?’ I had no money. It was the first time I experienced hunger. This is something everybody should do in live once, because experiencing hunger teaches you a lot. There was a time when I didn’t eat for two-three days, because I couldn’t eat. How long could friends help? They would’ve helped, but you also feel bad after a while… Credit cards are maxed out, everything is finished. It wasn’t like I was out on the streets, but I did experience some level of lack of resources,” he said.
But things turned around for Anupam, and soon, he founds himself living the kind of life he’d only seen in the movies. “I became a multi-millionaire in my early 20s. It was crazy, I’d never imagined it. I’d ordered a sports car, we used to party in stadiums, our corporate parties would be on cruise ships. It was next level,” he said.

"When Akshay Kumar started bleeding underwater, was chased by sharks: ‘I could’ve been eaten’","Akshay Kumar has spoken about performing his own stunts on many occasions in the movies but a few years ago, one of those dangerous stunts could have ended the actor’s life.

In an interview with The Times of India at the time, Akshay said that he was shooting without oxygen tanks and could not control his body movement underwater. “I hit my head on a sunken ship and got injured 150 feet underwater, and the blood oozed out. I was in a daze. I could’ve been dead. I could’ve been eaten by one of the sharks,” he said.

Baahubali makers wanted to cast Sanjay Dutt for Kattappa but couldn’t because ‘he was still in jail’,"Baahubali writer and father of director SS Rajamouli, V. Vijayendra Prasad, recently revealed that he, along with the makers of the superhit film wanted Sanjay Dutt to play Kattappa originally but they couldn’t do it because the actor was still in jail.
Talking to Rediff in 2020, Prasad had said that while Prabhas was always their first choice to play Baahubali, they had Sanjay Dutt in mind to play Kattappa. He said, “Only for Kattappa, we had Sanjay Dutt in mind. But then it was dicey as he was still in jail. The next option was Sathyaraj.”
Prasad also shared how he came up with the story for Baahubali and Rajamouli’s first vision of the film. He shared, “My son (SS Rajamouli) told me he wanted to make a movie with Prabhas. He said it should be a costume drama and that he should be able to picturise good action scenes. He also said he wanted the female characters to be very powerful, equal to the male characters. And include some grey characters too.”Advertisement
Sharing that the first character that he wrote for the 2015 film was that of Kattappa’s. “The next morning, I narrated a small introduction to the character of Kattappa.

“I didn’t have a story with me, I just told him (Rajamouli) about a foreigner who comes to India and sees an old person teaching swordsmanship to young students. Impressed, the foreigner claims the old man to be the best swordsman in the region. The old man refutes his claim by telling him about Baahubali. He tells him that nobody was able to injure Baahubali as long as he had a sword. He fought against 200 people and killed them all. By evening, he would be soaked in blood, but not a drop was his. When the foreigner said he wanted to meet Baahubali, the old man said he was dead. The foreigner didn’t understand how that was possible. Then the old man said backstabbing is a more powerful weapon and told the foreigner that it was he who back-stabbed Baahubali. The other scene I narrated was of a mother carrying a child, wading across a river, which eventually became the powerful opening scene of the franchise. He told me to put it all together and weave a story. We took around four-five months to develop the script,” Prasad revealed.

Suhani, who was 19-years-old, reportedly suffered medical complications. She had previously spoken about why she didn’t sign any films after Dangal became a blockbuster, and said that she wanted to do lead roles after completing her studies.
In an interview with TV India Live almost two years ago, Suhani was asked why she didn’t capitalise on the success of Dangal and sign more films. She said in Hindi, “Apart from the films, I have done shoots, fashion shows and events. But right now, I am not focusing on films because I am concentrating on my studies. I am in 10th grade right now. After my basic education, for sure I want to do films, and I want to star as the lead.”
When pressed about doing more films, Suhani said, “I want to finish my education, and after that I want to be seen as a main lead in films. But if I get any opportunities between my studies, I will surely do it. Until then, I will only concentrate on my studies.”

"When Esha Deol said that she’d choose to run away over having an arranged marriage, revealed what she looks for in a partner: ‘Dependability’","Actor Esha Deol, who recently announced her separation from husband Bharat Takhtani, once spoke about never wanting to have an arranged marriage. Esha and Bharat knew each other as children in the same school, but began dating when they grew up. They tied the knot in 2012 and have two daughters – Radhya, 6, and Miraya, 4.
Chatting with Rediff on the sidelines of the release of her 2007 film Just Married, Esha said that she would probably run away if she’s forced to have an arranged marriage. “The only reason I did this film is because I know I will never have an arranged marriage. If I am told to do so, I will be a runaway bride! I admire those people who are ready to tie the knot with unknown people and do things to please their elders,” she said.

I think at times, it is unnecessary to depend on others but I still feel it is something that everyone should experience.” Esha said in the interview that she hadn’t found the right person to settle down with, but wanted to get married because she wants to have children.
Esha and Bharat had spoken often about their relationship and married life over the years. In an interview with Filmfare, Bharat described her as very ‘possessive’, and in her book Amma Mia, published in 2020, Esha shared that she became more ‘mature, responsible’ after she got married. She also revealed that she ‘couldn’t roam around the house in my shorts and ganjis like I used to’ after she began living with Bharat’s family.
Announcing their separation, Esha and Bharat told Delhi Times, “We have mutually and amicably decided to part ways. Through this shift in our lives, the best interests and welfare of our two children is and will be of utmost importance to us. We’d appreciate our privacy is respected.”

"Ragini Khanna says being related to Govinda did not necessarily help her career: ‘He is a very big star, I am not his daughter’","Actor Ragini Khanna rose to fame in the world of television with her shows such as Radhaa Ki Betiyaan Kuch Kar Dikhayengi and Sasural Genda Phool. She is also the niece of superstar Govinda but felt that this did not help her career.
In an interview with Siddharth Kanan, Ragini shared that Govinda’ children Tina Ahuja and Yashvardan Ahuja, might not go to television but being his niece, she didn’t have the privilege to be say no to television. Govinda has been part of the Hindi film industry for several decades and given multiple blockbuster films.
When asked if being related to Govinda was advantageous for her, Ragini said, “It is not. He is a very, very big star. Firstly I am not his daughter. I love Namu,(Tina Ahuja) I love Yash (Yashvardan Ahuja), I love them too much. We are pals but jab aap kaam pe jaate ho to aap waise nahi dekhe jaate ho. Agar Namu, Yash ko aap bol do ki television pe jao, wo nahi jayenge but ek Ragini jayegi. (We are pals but when you go for work, that is not how you are viewed. Will Nammu, Yash go to television? But a Ragini will go). You see the difference? Main chahti hun ki ye badle. (I want this to change) Why is television always a step down for movies?”Advertisement

"Anupam Mittal opens up about investing in Porter, predicts company could hit Rs 33,000 crore valuation: ‘Will I wait till then?’","Shark Tank India’s Anupam Mittal opened up about his investment journey, and looked back on his smart decision to get into the mobilities industry. Anupam was an early investor in the ride-sharing company Ola, and revealed in a new interview that he could’ve exited Porter if he wanted to recently, but believes he stands to make more money if he’s more patient.
In an appearance on the Barbershop podcast, Anupam said that because he’d spent a decade in the US, he had an understanding about the trends that were certain to start in India. “I am, generally speaking, overtly optimistic. As an entrepreneur, you have to be. And that’s how Ola also happened fairly early on,” he said. Asked how he came to invest in Ola, Anupam said, “My friend told me about it, and asked if I’d want to consider being a part. But you know how it is, your own experiences shape your understanding of things, and I couldn’t imagine how someone would have any difficulty hailing a cab. I’d lived in Mumbai, where you can get a ride as soon as you step out of your house.”

But, as luck would have it, Anupam was in Delhi at the time, and realised that getting a cab could actually be difficult for some people. “So I started calling Bhavish Aggarwal’s call centre, and half the time he’d only answer the phone. That’s how things are at the beginning. I found him to be passionate, determined, and I decided to invest Rs 20-3o lakh.” In a recent interview with CNN-News18, Anupam said that he exited the company with ‘several hundred crores’.
Anupam also spoke about investing in Porter, which recently hit a valuation of over Rs 3700 crore. “Porter is killing it. And see, you can’t always take an exit. With Porter as well, I could’ve exited at half-a-billion north. But I know with Porter, there’s dominance, there’s network, the team is solid. Many players have exited this industry after accepting defeat. So, I believe this is a $4-5 billion outcome. Will I wait until then? Probably not. But maybe the next year I’ll get out.”
Anupam can currently be seen on the third season of Shark Tank India. He has appeared in every season of the reality show, alongside Aman Gupta, Namita Thapar, Vineeta Singh and Peyush Bansal.",entertainmaent

"JD Majethia reflects on Khichdi 2’s failure, says piracy killed its chances: ‘Everyone downloaded and watched it at home’","Hansa, Babuji, Praful, Khichdi, Jayshree… these characters continue to find a space in our hearts and on our TV screens even after two decades. The beloved comedy show, which aired in 2002, captivated audiences with its quirky humour and relatable characters. Continued sequels, followed by a film in 2010, the franchise attempted to reignite the magic with Khichdi 2: Mission Paanthukistan in 2023. However, the latest film received a lukewarm response at the box office, leaving fans and the show’s creator, JD Majethia, pondering the reasons behind its struggles.
In an interview with India Today, actor-director Majethia acknowledged the film’s unfortunate release date, coinciding with the high-profile Tiger 3 and the cricket World Cup finals, both stealing audience attention. Additionally, he admits widespread piracy dealt a significant blow, with viewers opting for instant access over cinema halls. “We didn’t want to release during Diwali with Tiger 3, so we went for the next week. Sunday is the biggest day for films, but we had the World Cup finale that day, and India was playing. It was a risk, and sadly, it didn’t pay off,” he rued.
Majethia also reflected on the film’s format, stating that Khichdi’s heart lies in its small-screen charm, suggesting the big-screen adaptation might not have been the perfect fit. Speaking about the film’s failure in theaters and piracy, he added, “People did not want to wait to go to theaters to watch the film. Everyone downloaded and watched it in the comfort of their homes. I was amazed at the number of messages I received from everyone. However, it was too late. Honestly, I was really disappointed as we had worked so hard, especially on the songs and important sequences.”Advertisement

Despite the disappointment, the filmmaker, who plays the character of Himanshu in the franchise, remains optimistic. He highlighted the positive response on digital platforms, proving the enduring love for the characters and stories. He emphasises the film’s timeless nature, stating, “I honestly believe that a product (like Khichdi) never fails. We did decent business also. But unfortunately, we could not touch the financial mark we had expected. Everything just went against us,” suggesting its continued reach through future viewings.
Majethia also acknowledges the inherent pressure of creating sequels in an ever-evolving entertainment landscape. He notes the changing dynamics of humor and audience attention spans, requiring careful adaptation to resonate with modern viewers. This is echoed in his ongoing discussions with the Sarabhai vs Sarabhai cast — Rupali Ganguly, Rajesh Kumar, and Satish Shah — who have been asking him for a sequel soon. “They tell me at least make an episode. That’s how much they want the show to be back,” said Majethia, adding, “One needs to be sure when doing a sequel. You have to place the characters in today’s world.”",entertainmaent

Allu Arjun said that in the second part, viewers can expect to see the character portrayed with even greater depth and intensity than before. He added that the scale of the character and the challenges they face will be larger than in the first installment of the movie. 
He said, “Till then it was playing on a regional scale, now it will play on a national and international scale. Pushpa 1, police officer Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat, played by Fahadh Faasil, emerges as a thorn in Pushpa’s side. The conflict between them is going to “escalate to a much bigger, bigger scale.”Advertisement

When Ranbir Kapoor told dad Rishi Kapoor and uncle Randhir Kapoor not to produce Barfi because of its ‘risky subject’,"Filmmaker Anurag Basu’s film Barfi was an ambitious but unconventional film when it released over a decade ago. Starring Ranbir Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra, the film was released in 2012 and is still loved by many for its delicate storytelling. However, Ranbir found the subject of the film ‘risky’ and warned his father Rishi Kapoor and uncle Randhir Kapoor when they offered to produce the film.
Randhir had previously revealed in an interview with Rediff.com that he and Rishi were ready to back Barfi as producers but Ranbir discouraged them. “I remember once I was having a drink with my brother (Rishi Kapoor) when Ranbir came in and told us that he had heard a fantastic script and was working in the film as the lead actor. He said the film did not have a producer. My brother and I said that we would produce the film,” he said.
The veteran actor added, “Ranbir warned us, “Yeh subject thoda risky, toh aap log mat produce karo “(The subject is a bit risky so you don’t produce it). That film was Barfi. It is one of those rare films in today’s time which has a soul.” Barfi was later produced by Ronnie Screwwala and Siddharth Roy Kapur under the banner of UTV Motion Pictures.Advertisement

Ranbir had previously revealed how his father advised him against doing ‘arty’ films like Barfi. The Animal actor told PTI, “My father says it as it is. He is not a hypocrite. When he saw Barfi!, he told me acting is good but don’t do arty films. His cinema is very different and he sometimes expects me to follow it. His are the opinions that I look up to. It may take 15-20 years but I will keep trying to make him happy. He is happy with my work in Bombay Velvet, it is an incentive to work harder.”
Barfi also marked the debut of Ileana D’Cruz. The film was India’s selection for the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film.

Chunky Panday says Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives is a ‘bit scripted’: ‘But those girls are like that’,"Bollywood actor Chunky Panday has been working in the film industry for over 30 years and has appeared in well over 100 films, earning a place in the hearts of audiences. After the OTT boom, he also ventured into the digital space and appeared in a couple of web series, the last one being the Disney+ Hotstar comedy-drama Pop Kaun?, which was created by Farhad Samji.
Meanwhile, Panday has also been making appearances on the Netflix reality TV series Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives, which focuses on the personal and professional lives of Bhavana Pandey, Neelam Kothari, Maheep Kapoor, and Seema Kiran Sajdeh, the wives of Chunky Panday, Samir Soni, Sanjay Kapoor, and Sohail Khan (divorced), respectively.

Reflecting on a recent encounter, Panday shared a humorous anecdote of being recognised by an air hostess. He, however, said that she had no clue who he was and identified him solely as the guy who appears on Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives. “Then they made me video call Bhavana. They only knew I was on the show and a husband. They had no clue I was an actor myself,” he said laughing, while on the show Cyrus Says.Advertisement
He further mentioned that though the show is slightly scripted, the women in focus are pretty much portrayed as they are. “Even though it’s slightly scripted, those girls are like that. You can’t fool the camera for a long time. You can do it for 10-15 minutes and fake out a few things. But if you keep it on me for two hours, I’ll come out in my chaddi,” he added.

“Look at me, I was once upon a time Chunky Panday. Then I became Ananya Panday’s father. Now I am Bhavana Panday’s husband.

"Huma Qureshi says female actors are seen as ‘replaceable’, talks about why male actors are paid more: ‘Bigger budget for the hero because of his gender’","Huma Qureshi recently expressed her wish to do a film like Ranbir Kapoor’s Animal and ‘hold a machine gun, killing thousands of people’ because she ‘loved the machismo, action, and music’ in Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s directorial. The actor-producer, who is busy promoting her book Zeba, doesn’t only desire to play larger-than-life characters like male counterparts but also wants equal pay.
During an interview with AfterHours with All About Eve, the Maharani actor opened up about the pay disparity in Bollywood and how the phenomenon needs to change. When asked if actors are paid according to the screen time they get, Huma explained, “The conventional way is: the bigger the star, the more money they take home, oftentimes, even when their screen time is shorter and their roles are smaller.”
Huma, who performed a graceful dance number — Shikayat — in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Gangubai Kathiawadi, added, “Alia Bhatt will draw more money than others even if her part is small. I am assuming that she was the highest-paid actor in Gangubai Kathiawadi.”Advertisement
ALSO READ | Bhavna Chauhan opens up about now viral ad with Ranveer Singh, says she thought she was going to work with John Cena
She laments that despite the star power that female actors bring to the screen, male actors get the bigger chunk of the pie. “Unfortunately, in our films, women are often not paid as much as men are even if they’re at the same level of stardom. There is a bias that a male actor needs to be paid more because the film’s story is always revolving around the male protagonist. It is quite unfortunate,” she rued.
Huma has floored the audience with her work in films like Gangs of Wasseypur, Badlapur, Monica, O My Darling, Ek Thi Daayan, and D Day, among others. She also turned producer with her film Double XL. She stressed that even as a producer, she has to listen to the studios as far as the pay for male and female stars is concerned, and therefore, it is imperative that mindsets change at a deeper level for female actors to be paid fairly.
“As a producer, if I am making an action film, with a male star or a female star and they’re at the same level of stardom, I will probably get a bigger budget for the male hero because of his gender. That’s a fact. The studios do this. If a change has to happen, it has to be systemic and at a corporate and studio level. The change cannot come by just two people speaking about pay parity in their interviews,” the Mumbai Saga actor added.Advertisement
She revealed that the disparity is not only in terms of pay but also the kind of infrastructure that female actors are provided. She said that the rooms and vanity vans given to female actors are different from that of male stars. She added that inequality is also prevalent among the supporting actors. “In a film, if two actors are playing my parents, the guy playing my father will probably get paid a little more than the female actor playing the role of my mother. The mentality is ‘Yeh toh aise hi chalta aa raha hai (This has been going on like this)’ and comes from the idea that women are replaceable. They think ‘koi na koi heroine toh mil hi jaegi (We will find some or the other actress)’.”
ALSO READ | Esha Deol and Bharat Takhtani first broke up as teenagers, got married 10 years later: ‘After that day, I didn’t take his calls’
Huma has always voiced her opinion on the topic and never minced her words when it came to addressing income gaps in the industry. Speaking at Agenda AajTak 2022, in the past, she had said, “Equal pay for equal work. If there are two people who are working at an equal level in terms of their career and box office, they should be paid the same amount, which they don’t. It is very sad. It is often said that female-led action films don’t work but male-led action films do. If you take a look at the ratio of films made with male leads and female leads, it’s very off. But now, several female stars are working.”

"From mimicry artist to Amaran, why Sivakarthikeyan’s journey is as rare as hen’s teeth in Tamil cinema","Sivakarthikeyan has a lot of new fans, especially among youngsters and children. The young fanbase might have seen him as the lazy, good-for-nothing youngster with a heart of gold in films like Remo and Varuthapadatha Valibar Sangam. They might have also seen him in this new avatar of a mass hero. However, many young fans might be unaware of his past as a mimicry artist, an image Siva has carefully shed for good. And that is why Siva is extremely conscious about his image and he has been vocal about not taking up films that are not cut for him. What’s so impressive about Siva is that despite being an out-and-out entertainer, known for his comedy dramas, the actor has efficiently buried the image of a comedian. He is still entertaining with comedy, but has made sure that the joke is not on him. It is a fine balance, inarguably an impressive achievement in an industry, which is quick to box anyone.
Over the years, many comedians have tried their hand at becoming a hero, with middling and underwhelming results. A great example would be Vadivelu. The king of Tamil comedy and pop culture tried to evolve as a full-fledged hero. While his initial attempt, Imsai Arasan 23am Pulikeci, was an instant success, he couldn’t emulate the same with his subsequent attempt at being the lead. Indra Logathil Naa Azhagappan, Tenali and Ezhi are some of the bad apples in his filmography. Another example is the late actor Vivekh, who also took a stab at it, even before Vadivelu. He acted in the lead role back in 1991 in a film titled Sendhoora Devi, a flop. Vivekh then was part of multi-starrers like Kandha Kadamba Kadhirvela, Viralukaetha Veekam, and many such family dramas that were in vogue in the early 2000s. Yet, these were, in essence, full-fledged comedy roles with actors like Livingston and Pandiyaraj playing the lead. Maganae Marumagane, Naan Thaan Bala, and Ezhumeen are the films which finally had Vivekh as the leading man, but even an ardent fan of the comedian might not have seen them. Vivekh had his moment as a hero with Vellaipookal. As a retired police officer inspecting a crime in the US, the actor finally got his due. Perhaps, if he had been around, we would have gotten more of it.

Invariably, although comedy actors in Tamil have acted as heroes, they could never evolve into a star like Sivakarthikeyan. It is hard to imagine Vadivelu or Vivekh starring in a police action drama like Kaaki Sattai or even a silly comedy-drama like Varuthapadatha Vaalibar Sangam. Even Santhanam, who has had hits as a hero, is still struggling to break out of his image as a comedian. His recent films, featuring him as lead actor, are comedies, and any attempt of the actor to become an action hero is immediately punished by the audience. Sakka Podu Podu Raja is one great example where Santhanam tried to be the quintessential mass hero, and the film bit the dust within days of its release. However, when Santhanam stays in his zone with borderline parody films like A1, Dhilluku Dhuddu, and Dikkiloona, he gets his reward. There’s a dedicated fanbase for such Santhanam films among Tamil audiences. 
In such an industry, which doesn’t let an actor break away from his mould, Sivakarthikeyan, who had his initial breakthrough as a mimicry artist on Tamil television, has managed to become a star. The evolution has been possible because the comedians before Sivakarthikeyan had one major trait that put them at a disadvantage–their body language. Throughout Tamil cinema history, when it comes to comedy, ‘slapstick’ ruled the roost. Starting from Chandra Babu to Nagesh to Vaidivelu, every comedy actor in Tamil developed a distinct body language that became the person’s style. This extended beyond their onscreen roles. Their movements, walk, and mannerisms became part of their real-life existence. And that’s why even Vadivelu’s speech at events are as riotous as his comedy films. Siva ducked this phenomenon because he made a living by mocking such mannerisms. He was a mimicry artist who could emulate Vadivelu’s body language and steal some laughs, but he never had to come up with one of his own. YouTube is still full of his videos from the period where he was a mimicry artist. From emulating Sivaji Ganesan to Goundamani to Vijayakanth, Siva, in a sense, has adopted the mannerisms of many distinct personalities for a living. Perhaps, that is the reason, he was able to come up with something unique for himself. After all, jack of-all-trades can be master of one.",entertainmaent
Shark Tank India 3: Aman Gupta raises valuation of pitcher’s company by 150 percent as Anupam Mittal gets in a fight with Namita Thapar,"A recent pitch in Shark Tank 3’s episode made history with the investors or ‘sharks’ as they raised the company’s valuation by 150 percent. Vineeta Singh, Aman Gupta and Anupam Mittal were in competition against each other as they tried to make a deal with a sports tech company owned largely by a 22-year old.
The founders Hitarth Parikh, Chahil Patel and Harsheet Maliwal, made an impressive pitch for their sports tech brand Hyperlab, leaving the sharks surprised. The sharks were quite impressed with the technology offered by the company and were amused as Hitarth revealed that he came up with it after he saw a cat chase around a dot of light. Anupam actually laughed out loud and called Hitharth and ‘innovator’ when he shared the cat anecdote.
Initially, Anupam offered Rs 1 crore for 5 percent of their company’s equity. This led to Aman revising his offer and giving Rs 25 lakh for 1 percent of the equity and he offered to help in electronic manufacturing. Vineeta and Namita were quick to match Aman’s offer, leaving it to the pitchers to take the final call. All of this was quite surprising as by the end of the pitch, Aman had increased their valuation by 150 percent.Advertisement
The company owners requested some time to make a call, which was granted to them. Meanwhile, the sharks were seen arguing with each other for raising the valuation. Aman said, “This has happened for the first time that we have started doubling the valuations.” Anupam was upset about this as he told Namita, “Don’t double it. Increase it by 10-20 percent.”

"Express At Berlinale: Iranian film My Favourite Cake is a warm, funny film about loneliness and repression","Seventy year old Mahin is the loneliest widow you ever saw. Her army man husband has been dead thirty years. Her grown-up daughter has left Iran, and made a life elsewhere. But as she tells the man she picks up– yes, that’s what she does– as step one of the most unusual yet spirited seduction that I’ve seen on screen, Tehran is her home. Why should she leave? He is a taxi driver, and also lives alone, and most of the film focusses on these two elderly people, trying to make a connection in a country drowning under draconian gender rules.
The directors of ‘Keyke Mahboobe Man’ (My Favourite Cake), Maryam Moghaddam and Behtash Sanaeeha, were refused permission to travel for the world premier of their film at the 74th edition of the Berlin International Film Festival. It’s one of the first Iranian films that shows women in their home without a hijab, and the filmmakers said they are aware that there can be grave consequences of their choice. But the sight of Mahin, literally letting her hair down in the company of a male stranger, puts a smile on your face: this is a film whose beats are predictable, but also joyful, and moving.

The two empty chairs at the press conference after the screening was an eloquent statement against the continued restrictions against filmmakers in one of the most repressive regimes in the world. In a statement read out by the lead actress Lily Farhadpour, who infuses her old lady character with a remarkably youthful zest, the duo mourned the complicated rules under which they have to operate when they attempt to showcase the reality of their lives.Advertisement
This year’s competition section at Berlinale, under directors Mariette Rissenbeek and Carlo Chatrian, is a mix of arthouse and more accessible cinema, which is being seen as a sign of the times, and something of a rising feature in even the most rigorous film festivals around the world. ‘My Favourite Cake’, a warm, funny film about loneliness and repression, manages to hit the sweet spot between the personal and political: a late-morning walk in the neighbouring park leads to an encounter with the morality police out scouring for women they can corral, and only her intervention saves a young girl, whose hair is visible under her not-so-tightly worn scarf, from being carted off to the cop station.
The young girl is here to meet her boy-friend. She knows what it is like to be targetted. Once before, when the cops showed up, the twosome had saved themselves by claiming they were siblings. It’s not just the seventeen year olds who have to be careful about who they are seen with. Seventy-year-olds like Mahin, and the taxi-driver, both consenting adults, have to hide from a nosy neighbour when she comes enquiring about hearing ‘a man’s voice’ in the house.
As the unexpected encounter between these two progresses, the film also makes a powerful statement about the importance of intimacy, and humanity. If only it were as simple as tossing up a favourite piece of confectionary.",entertainmaent

Amitabh said, “When I went to audition for Saat Hindustani, Khwaja Ahmad Abbas asked my name. When I told him I am Amitabh Bachchan, he asked me my father’s name and I told him it was Harivansh Rai Bachchan. On hearing my father’s name, he asked me to wait outside and called my father. He thought I have come for the audition without informing anyone in the house. So, he called my father and clarified if he knew about it.”

She shared that she did not get to interact with Johnny much but mentioned that “he was quite cooperative and professional.”Advertisement
Bhavna also addressed the backlash that the ad has been receiving from several actors from the television industry. Actor Rashami Desai had expressed that she was displeased with the ad. Taking to Instagram story, Rashmi wrote a long note, calling the ad ‘humiliation to the TV industry’ that felt like a ‘slap’ on their faces.
Addressing the flak, Bhavna said that they weren’t trying to make fun of the TV industry. “They are marketers and understand the ripple effect of such things. Honestly, the original script was funnier but they altered it accordingly. The intention has always been to make it look like a normal scene from a TV show so that it’s viewed casually by everyone at home. They wanted the topic to be normalised.”

"Bramayugam box office collection Day 2: Mammootty’s horror film is marching ahead of his acclaimed film Kaathal, earns over Rs 5 cr","Malayalam superstar Mammootty’s film Bramayugam had a strong opening on its first day in the theatres and even on the second day, the film witnessed a great turn out. The box office collection of the film is currently at Rs 5.6 crore, as per industry tracker Sacnilk. Bramayugam started its box office journey with Rs 3.1 crore and collected Rs 2.5 crore on its second day.
The Malayalam film saw maximum turnout during the night shows with 72.65 percent occupancy. This was followed by 51 percent occupancy in evening shows and 36.83 percent and 26.92 percent occupancy in afternoon and morning shows respectively. Bramayugam is doing way better that Mammootty’s last release, the critically acclaimed film Kaathal – The Core. Kaathal earned Rs 1.25 crore on its second day.
The first weekend will serve as a litmus test for the film to see if the excitement continues till the film’s first Monday. The film’s buzz is also credited to the fact that the movie, directed by Rahul Sadasivan, is a black-and-white period horror movie. The film has received good reviews from the audience and critics.Advertisement

During a press meet in UAE, Mammootty had addressed why they made the film in black and white. He said, “It unfolds in a period prior to cinema’s invention. The new generation may not have experienced black and white to the same extent in films, and this film is apt for such experimentation. I am not saying we don’t have black and white films anymore,” he noted, citing the 2011 Oscar-winning movie The Artist as an example.
Bramayugam also stars Arjun Ashokan, Sidharth Bharathan, Amalda Liz, and Manikandan R Achari in key roles. The film is jointly produced by Night Shift Studios and YNOT Studios.",entertainmaent
"Keyke Mahboobe Man’: Predictable beats , but a joyful and moving watch","Seventy-year-old Mahin is the loneliest widow you ever saw. Her army man husband has been dead thirty years. Her grown-up daughter has left Iran, and made a life elsewhere. But as she tells the man she picks up – yes, that’s what she does – as step one of the most unusual yet spirited seduction that I’ve seen on screen, Tehran is her home.
Why should she leave? He is a taxi driver, and also lives alone, and most of the film focuses on these two elderly people, trying to make a connection in a country drowning under draconian gender rules.
The directors of ‘Keyke Mahboobe Man’ ( My Favourite Cake), Maryam Moghaddam and Behtash Sanaeeha, were refused permission to travel for the world premier of their film at the 74th edition of the Berlin International Film Festival. It’s one of the first Iranian films that shows women in their home without a hijab, and the filmmakers said they are aware that there can be grave consequences of their choice. But the sight of Mahin, literally letting her hair down in the company of a male stranger, puts a smile on your face : this is a film whose beats are predictable, but also joyful, and moving.Advertisement
The two empty chairs at the press conference after the screening was an eloquent statement against the continued restrictions against filmmakers in one of the most repressive regimes in the world. In a statement read out by the lead actress Lily Farhadpour, who infuses her old lady character with a remarkably youthful zest, the duo mourned the complicated rules under which they have to operate when they attempt to showcase the reality of their lives.
This year’s competition section at Berlinale, under directors Mariette Rissenbeek and Carlo Chatrian, is a mix of arthouse and more accessible cinema, which is being seen as a sign of the times, and something of a rising feature in even the most rigorous film festivals around the world. ‘My Favourite Cake’, a warm, funny film about loneliness and repression, manages to hit the sweet spot between the personal and political : a late-morning walk in the neighbouring park leads to an encounter with the morality police out scouring for women they can corral, and only her intervention saves a young girl, whose hair is visible under her not-so-tightly worn scarf, from being carted off to the cop station.
The young girl is here to meet her boyfriend. She knows what it is like to be targeted. Once before, when the cops showed up, the twosome had saved themselves by claiming they were siblings. It’s not just the seventeen-year-olds who have to be careful about who they are seen with. Seventy-year-olds like Mahin, and the taxi driver, both consenting adults, have to hide from a nosy neighbour when she comes enquiring about hearing ‘a man’s voice’ in the house.
As the unexpected encounter between these two progresses, the film also makes a powerful statement about the importance of intimacy, and humanity. If only it were as simple as tossing up a favourite piece of confectionary.",entertainmaent
Nora Fatehi : ‘Hope writers make films with female characters that can do next level action’,"Being a dancer helped her learn stunts in the upcoming film Crakk, says Nora Fatehi who wants to do “next-level action” like co-stars Vidyut Jammwal and Arjun Rampal in her future projects.
Fatehi, who has featured in films such as Street Dancer 3D and Bhuj: The Pride of India, said like dance, action is also set to choreography.
“As a dancer, you are like an athlete too. The level we take our bodies to physically is crazy. You do the same thing in the dance and action world. You have to follow a certain choreography when the action director is formulating a scene.Advertisement
“I feel it (being a dancer) helped me. Arjun and Vidyut did next level action, I had an action sequence but not like what they did which was out of this world. I only hope one day writers make films with female roles that can do such stunts. I want that because I’m ready to do that,” the 32-year-old told PTI.

She also described Crakk, directed by Aditya Datt, as a film by “self-made actors and outsiders”. Jammwal has also backed the movie via his Action Hero Films banner.

“We all know that a debate has been going on for a couple of years about outsiders and how come they are not in certain projects and how filmmakers don’t take them in especially big-budget projects. Vidyut and Aditya sir took a punt on all self-made actors and outsiders on a huge budget film,” added Fatehi.Advertisement

Crakk follows the journey of a man named Siddhu, played by Jammwal, from the slums of Mumbai to the world of extreme underground sports.
Rampal, who stars as the antagonist in the film, shared his definition of a villain. The 51-year-old has previously played grey roles in titles such as Om Shanti Om, Ra.One and Dhaakad.
“I think a person who loses control over curbing his or her desires (is a villain). These desires could be harmful to another individual… Being absolutely selfish, that person kind of goes towards a villainous trait. If you have desires that are not harmful and they are as strong as the villain’s desires but they don’t harm anybody…” he added.
Jackson, 32, said she is happy to be starring in films again after a five-year hiatus.Advertisement
The actor, known for Ekk Deewana Tha and “2.0”, said she has been trying to strike a balance between work and motherhood.
“When I got the call about Crakk, I thought this is not what I had in mind but I sat with Aditya on Zoom, heard the storyline and it was fantastic. It was challenging trying to juggle schedules. That mum guilt is always going to be there, all mums have it. But I also want him to know that I’m a working mum,” said Jackson, who is mother to four-year-old Andreas.
The actor said her son has been on sets with her and is familiar with India.
“He’s had that beautiful experience of new cultures, travelling, seeing mum on the big screen. It instils a kind of work ethic which is really important to me as a mother. And, this film goes hand in hand in my evolution and it has also helped his life. Everything I do now is for him,” she added.
Crakk is set to be released on February 23.

But I feel that people who do that come from a place of being unhappy. So, I feel bad for them,” she said.

"Hema Malini visits Ayodhya Ram Temple, says, ‘Because of the temple, people are getting employment’","Actor-turned-politician Hema Malini on Friday paid a visit to the historic Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.
After offering prayers at the temple, Hema Malini told ANI, “We had a good ‘darshan’. All the arrangements are good here…Because of the temple, so many people are getting employment.”
The Pran Pratishtha ceremony of Lord Ram in the newly built Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Mandir in Ayodhya was held on January 22, led by rituals that were performed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Advertisement

“This is not just a moment of celebration for us all but also one to reflect the coming of age of the Indian society. This occasion is as much about triumph as it is about humility. The world is replete with instances of countries that faced a lot of difficulties resolving historic wrongs and injustices. However, the way we untied the knots and resolved all outstanding issues gives us hope that our future is going to be more beautiful and fulfilling than our past,” PM Modi said.

The PM said that the construction of the temple, which some feared would set off a firestorm, now stands as a symbol of peace, patience, harmony and integration.”There was also a time when some people used to say ‘Ram Mandir bana toh aag lag jaegi’ (the making of the Ram Temple would set off a firestorm). Such people lacked an understanding of the purity of our society, the spirit that binds us all. This majestic abode of Shri Ram Lalla will now stand as a symbol of peace, patience, mutual harmony and social unity. The construction of this temple did not set off a fire but exuded a positive energy that has been infectious for us all,” he added.

Kiran Rao says story of Laapataa Ladies came to her because of ex-husband Aamir Khan: ‘Could never have written a story like this myself’,"There is a lot of goodness in the world and it sometimes doesn’t reflect on the big screen, says Kiran Rao who has done her bit to rectify that in her latest film Laapataa Ladies, a comic take on two brides in rural India who accidentally get swapped during a train journey.
The Dhobi Ghat filmmaker, who returns to direction after 14 years, said audiences have been conditioned to expect the worst, especially when it comes to women’s safety. But her film, while realistic and grounded, doesn’t go there.
“Honestly, this story could have gone in any direction. It could have been any other genre. When we were writing this, we were conscious that while we are touching upon several issues, the idea is to entertain and make it an accessible and a fun journey,” Rao told PTI.Advertisement
“I feel there’s a lot of goodness in the world. When we look at our lives, we realise there are so many people around us who give us hope and love. We’re surrounded by people we admire, and we don’t see enough of them on screen,” she added.

The director admits it was challenging to keep the touch light but she saw it as an opportunity to show flawed and familiar characters who are “lovable and real”.
“It was a bit of a balancing act to keep the realism while keeping the satire and humour… You feel like you know these people,” she said.Advertisement
Rao said she had been working on creating a script that would become her next film but “nothing quite clicked”. Till ex-husband Aamir Khan returned from a screenwriting competition he was judging.
“Aamir came home and told me a one-liner, about two girls on a train and how they get swapped. And I was hooked. I knew that this was not just a great story but also a great opportunity for me.
“Honestly, I could never have written a story like this myself. It’s not naturally my kind of story when I write but I felt I could bring something of myself to it,” she said.
Eventually, the story by Biplab Goswami was developed into a film with Sneha Desai working on the screenplay and dialogues.Advertisement
Rao’s Kindling Productions and Khan’s Aamir Khan Productions have produced the film, slated to release on March 1.
The ex-couple has been promoting the film together. The fact that the two enjoy a great friendship despite their divorce in 2021 surprises many. But then, as Rao said, they have always made their own rules.
“Perhaps we’ve not adhered to anything very strictly conventional in many ways. It wasn’t anything we planned. We are friends, we enjoy each other’s company. We’ve had a fulfilling marriage for almost 17 years. You can’t sever ties because of some sort of annulment or like breaking up of a social contract,” she said.
Continuing to be friends and family came naturally to them, she said.Advertisement

“We care deeply for each other and our families are still interwoven. The test of any friendship is to work together really because it is very hard. That actually will prove to people who think that we are acting. (So) It’s proven that we still like to work together.”
The original story of Laapataa Ladies was more in the drama genre but Rao said she felt it would work better if it was a bit more “humorous, funny and emotional”.
Actors Pratibha Ratna and Nitanshi Goel play the brides and Sparsh Shrivastav is the hapless husband who ends up bringing home the wrong one.Advertisement
Shot in a village in Madhya Pradesh, Laapataa Ladies is set in 2001 when mobile phones were still a luxury in rural areas and something to be “given as dowry”, she added.
“It seemed more realistic that it would take somebody five days to find their way back home or to for someone to find it.” Actor Ravi Kishan is the “paan-chewing” police officer who is corrupt but not without conscience.

Rao said Kishan took to the role naturally. Khan had also auditioned for the part but both felt that the Bhojpuri cinema star was a better fit.
“He (Kishan) used to say, ‘I have met many such police officers who chew paan’. I was very keen on paan. He said, ‘karte hain, karte hain’. He enjoyed playing the character,” the director said.
The filmmaker said she has many projects that are slowly coming to “some sort of fruition” and hopes to begin shooting at some point this year.Advertisement
“I don’t want to be ‘laapata’ for such a long time. Unfortunately, anyone in the film world knows this and will tell you that it’s a waiting game. I don’t have anything confirmed yet but I’ve got a few projects that I’m hoping will take off by the end of the year. So we’ll be shooting hopefully in a year from now,” she said.
Along with Rao and Khan, Laapataa Ladies is also produced by Jyoti Deshpande. The film is presented by Jio Studios.

So, all these inputs I keep getting from him also because he’s so experienced. It’s really nice to keep getting that feedback constantly and I like that because sometimes what I think and sometimes what I do when I go on sets, that one suggestion would just elevate the scene.”

The Holdovers movie review: Paul Giamatti showcases his formidable range,"“Sex,” says Paul Hunham, a dour, curmudgeonly teacher at a boarding school for boys, “is 99% friction, and 1% good will.” Hunham (Giamatti) has gone in for the first part all his life and earned none of the latter – and the film is tactfully elusive on whether he has managed to hit that 100% mark, ever.
We have been here before – schools with boys running around like wild horses and teachers who see their job as breaking them in. Till, there is that one teacher who sits down and listens to the boys, or girls, and changes their worlds.
Director Payne, a teller of stories bearing a lifetime of regret, brings it down to one teacher, one student, and one mess staffer. Hunham has nowhere to go, Angus (Sessa) has been abruptly told by his mother that the St Kitts vacation he was looking forward to stands cancelled, and Mary (Randolph) has just lost her son in the Vietnam War. This Christmas hence, they are the “holdovers” at the prestigious Barton School – in other words, the “Christian orphans” with no family to go to at this festive time.Advertisement
Also read | Madame Web movie review: Dakota Johnson can’t save this dreary film
Barton is a school for largely White, privileged kids, and while Angus is one of them, both Hunham and Mary are the “outsiders” who have made it into the system. Hunham was a scholarship kid, who came back to teach because he loved Barton. Mary took up a job of the mess cook so that her son could study at the school.
Watch | The trailer of The Holdovers starring Paul Giamatti

It’s over a lonesome, snowy fortnight, with the three of them confined to that one small quarter of the big school kept heated during the vacations, that The Holdovers unfolds.
Angus is rebellious but smart, earning the best grades in the class but carrying the baggage of having a mother who has moved on to her next husband, and his previous expulsions from two schools. Sessa has an unusual face that can look extremely vulnerable and young at some places, and prematurely old at others. What is evident is that Angus has aged too fast, and the sorrow he bears, even when at his risible best.Advertisement
Randolph is exquisite as Mary, who has buried her grief deep within folds of stoicism – as much to hold herself together, as to not let others see her as only an aggrieved mother. As a single, Black mother, she waged unsaid battles to get where she – and her son – did, and this is her last stand. Randolph has picked up several nominations, and some awards for her performance, and an Oscar might just be the next one.

That brings us to Giamatti, an actor of formidable range who is doing his second film with Payne after Sideways. It’s a pleasure to see the 56-year-old on screen as he melts from a bitter, hard-nosed teacher – who defines “bringing up good men with strong character”, and showing them little latitude, as the school’s aim – to one discovering unexpected kindness. An opening shot of his room at the school shows an unmade bed and a dirty stink with an ointment to manage piles — a glimpse of a man who has long given up on company.
Hunham’s body language changes visibly as Angus and Mary, and another staff member played sweetly by Preston, make space in his heart. He looks bigger, straighter, warmer, his good eye and the glass one expressing his wonder at this surprise so late in his life.Advertisement
The moment when the regret over all the lost years washes over Hunham’s face comes later – and there is hardly a throat without a lump in the theatre.
As Giamatti and the film too head for the Oscars, if there is a part that juts out in The Holdovers, it is the chip the film carries on its shoulders about the “privileged” vs the 99%. In a free-flowing film such as this, where true words are spoken on all sides without hurting hearts, it is a point that is too bluntly and too frequently laid out.

Priyamani says she did Chennai Express dance number ‘purely’ to share screen with Shah Rukh Khan: ‘I love him’,"The popular south Indian actor Priyamani gained relevance up North after starring opposite Shah Rukh Khan, first in a Chennai Express song and later in Atlee’s Jawan, and Manoj Bajpayee in Prime Video’s hit series The Family Man. But after doing a special dance sequence in Chennai Express, the actor was stormed with offers to do special dance numbers in the movies, which she refused to accept.
In a latest interview with India Today, Priyamani shared she didn’t want to be associated only with dance numbers, hence refused to do any of them, despite garnering praise for her Chennai Express song “One Two Three Four Get On The Dance Floor”, where she was paired opposite SRK.
Admitting to getting typecast in the film industry despite being a part of numerous significant projects spanning different languages the actor shared, “Post Chennai Express, I kept getting a lot of offers from people where they wanted me to do special numbers. I said, ‘No, I don’t want to do it. I don’t want to be known just for that.’ I purely did that only for Shah Rukh Khan because I love him and I wanted to star opposite him.”Advertisement

He is very courteous and respectful when it comes to anybody, not just women.”

While Priyamani holds Shah Rukh in high regard for his humble behaviour, she also has had a great experience working with ‘phenomenal’ Manoj Bajpayee on The Family Man. She played Bajpayee’s wife in the series.
Sharing what she learnt from the actor, she said, “With Manoj sir, I have learnt a lot of improvisation. I have the liberty to do it now, maybe not in Hindi, but in the South languages, I do it sometimes. He is very spontaneous and you always have to be on your toes when you are working with such a phenomenal actor as Manoj sir.”Advertisement

"Johnny Lever says he would see murders daily as a child in Mumbai’s Dharavi, had food only if he worked: ‘My father would drink’","Actor Johnny Lever is considered the best comedian in the film industry and has a strong body of work to prove that. However, his formative years in Mumbai’s Dharavi have been not only full of struggle but also exposed him to the dark realities of the slum life.
In an interview with BeerBiceps, the 66-year-old actor shared that due to his father’s alcoholism, he once attempted suicide but the thought of his three younger sisters made him change his mind.
Johnny spoke in Hindi, which loosely translates into, “I faced challenges in childhood. I had to look after my family. There would be food only if I worked. My daddy would drink and he wouldn’t know what he was doing. He used to indulge in rowdyism. So many times I had thrown away his weapons.”Advertisement
The actor further added, “At the age of 13, I went to a railway track to commit suicide. I was fed up with my father. So I went on the track and the train was coming. Suddenly the faces of my three younger sisters appeared in front of my eyes saying, ‘what will happen to us?’ and I immediately moved away from the track.”

Johnny, who is considered one of the most reputed artists in Bollywood now, said that it was music, which brought him out of that suicidal state of mind.
Further narrating the incidents of the same evening, Johhny said, “It must be around 6.45 pm or 7pm. I got up and went near a barber’s shop and it had some music playing there. Behind the shop, there was a bench and I sat there”
It was the song “Main to tum sang nain mila ke haar gayi sajna” from 1962 film Man Mauji, that caught Johnny’s attention at that moment.Advertisement
“That song was playing at the shop and I felt all the tension and depression going away from me. I started feeling good and I thought, ‘I was going to leave music?’ I am in love with music. Music saved me, and taught me how to live. Look at the power it has,” shared an emotional Johnny.
Recalling more days from Dharavi, the senior actor said it was usual for him and people of Dharavi to witness murders daily. He remembers seeing his first murder when he was just seven years old. “When I was going to school in Class 3. I was 7 years old. Someone had murdered and thrown someone. It doesn’t feel good to speak about these things but I have seen all this,” he said.
Johnny has also witnessed the time of Bombay gangsters Vardharajan and Haji Mastan.
He shared, “In our area, Vardharajan was there and Mastaan bhai was in Bombay’s side. They were like real brothers to each other. If something happened here in Dharavi, Mastaan saab would come and if that side something would happen, Vardharajan would go. When he would come here, there would be huge crowds. There was a lot of respect for him.”

Madame Web movie review: Dakota Johnson can’t save this dreary film,"“When you take on the responsibility, great power will come.” Something off with that line? You bet. It also sums up exactly what is wrong with Madame Web, which hangs around the Spider-Man galaxy in a milky way, hoping we will make the connection, but not quite.
Having jumped several loops on the way to the screen itself, including years in planning and rewrites, the uncertainty of this Dakota Johnson-starrer of its place is evident. The franchise is just one part of it, Madame Web of the comics too might find it hard seeing herself here.
In the comics, she is a blind, disabled old woman, seated on a chair shaped like a round whiskey decanter, weaving her tangled webs.Advertisement

Johnson, on the contrary, is the kind of star whose shine is difficult to hide, whether she is saving lives or getting saved. So, it is entirely misplaced to put the dreariness of this effort – directed by S J Clarkson, who is getting out of her TV zone with this film – on Johnson.

It is all that is happening around her which is difficult to fit in, starting with the era in which the film is set. Johnson’s paramedic Cassie Webb character, who works for the New York Fire Department, in her mix of largely white-red-black combination clothes (reminding you of a certain Spidey), looks very much like the It girl of the moment.
The moment being the present, surely, with the US having at its disposal all-the-world’s snooping powers.Advertisement
However, Peter Parker a.k.a Spider-Man – it is hinted – is as of now just a foetus in his mother’s womb, with uncle Ben (Scott) already around as a quasi-father.
One day, in a fire-and-rescue operation, Cassie survives near death, is out for three minutes, has a vision and, is soon having flashes from the future. These are discordant bits, some repeating themselves, others not, and not coming back to her entirely in sequence – making it rather confusing, and not just for Cassie.
The plot thickens when one of those flashes shows her that three teenage girls she has happened to run into on a train are facing danger from a man dressed like a black Spider-Man. But, no, no one says that word still. That man is the very limp villain, as villains go, by the name of Ezekiel Sims (Rahim).
Years ago, when he worked with Cassie’s mother as she trekked the deep Amazonian jungles while in the last stages of her pregnancy, he stole from her a spider with magical powers. Cassie was saved by a tribe that had harnessed those powers, and who also spoke amazingly good English – enough to come up with phrases like “To see the future, one must go to the wounds of the past”.Advertisement
Hence, Ezekiel’s powers; and hence Cassie’s, with her mother’s extremely detailed diary of notes are a big help. The teenage girls (who are so generic as to be offensive, including the otherwise eye-catching Sweeney) fit into the entangled webs of these two.
How? You can watch this to find out. Or not.

"Thundu movie review: Biju Menon, Shine Tom Chacko film will gauge your patience level at the cost of a ticket","Life’s been rough for civil police officer Baby John lately. In just a few days, he’s crashed an autorickshaw into a motorist while escorting the three-wheeler’s drunk driver to the nearest police station, his kid has been caught cheating during the school exams and he’s suffered injuries in a road accident. Though he thought he had hit rock bottom, there was still further to fall. Baby realises this only when he himself is busted cheating during the head constable exams, bringing shame to the department and his family.
Debutant director Riyas Shereef’s Thundu (a colloquial Malayalam word referring to small pieces of paper with notes written on them for cheating during exams; the word is also used by Malayalis to refer to porn videos) stars seasoned actor Biju Menon as Baby, a poor cop facing a string of misfortunes. Senior CPO Shibin Chandran (Shine Tom Chacko) keeps making things worse for Baby by constantly throwing him under the bus over some past beef. Troubles continue to plague Baby as everything he touches seems to turn into a disaster, affecting his family life as well.

Despite Riyas Shereef’s story having a decent setup for a funny flick, Thundu totally misses the mark and doesn’t use it to its full potential.Advertisement
While the film starts with a mass introduction of Mathew, Baby’s son, stepping into the classroom amidst high anticipation from his classmates and backed by powerful BGM, the character almost fades into the background for a significant portion of the movie, only to resurface towards the end, rendering his character somewhat underutilised. Upon reflection, it becomes apparent that the hype was for the paper chits used for cheating and the process itself, as several close-up shots had revealed the various methods employed by the students to conceal the notes. However, the staging of this sequence fails to convey that focus effectively, as the emphasis remains mostly on the child, which feels like a misstep.
Watch Thundu trailer here:

It is then that Thundu reveals its focus on Baby. Nevertheless, the moments fail to engage due to poor writing. The scenes don’t seamlessly connect, resulting in abrupt transitions. Even after introducing Shibin, the tension between him and Baby is not effectively communicated. They exchange tense looks, with Shibin often grinning at Baby while the latter remains in a perpetual state of embarrassment due to his misfortunes. However, as the true reason behind their conflict is concealed for an unnecessarily long time and the tension remains surface-level, this storyline becomes somewhat tedious over time.
Even the other conflicts lack the punch required to convey their significance in the narrative, resulting in everything seeming rather bleak. Though Thundu tries to elicit some laughs occasionally, many of the jokes and accompanying moments are poorly crafted and written, leading to wasted efforts by Riyas and co-screenwriter Kannappan.

Another major shortcoming that prevents Thundu from reaching heights is weak character development. It’s not just Baby; characters such as his wife (played by Unnimaya Prasad), Shibin, Mathew, Raghavan (Raffi) and others lack depth, failing to make a significant impact.Advertisement
However, Biju Menon makes an effort to elevate Thundu to some extent with his charm, decently portraying Baby’s helplessness even in less compelling scenes. He once again wears the police uniform with finesse, providing viewers with some relief. Shine Tom Chacko, on the other hand, surprises with his restrained performance, steering clear of the irritating persona he exhibits in real-life interviews. His efforts would have been more rewarding with a deeper character. Despite attempts by Raffi, Sajin Cherukayil, Zhinz Shan, and Shaju Sreedhar to inject humour at times, their scope is limited.

One of the major disappointments in the film is Jimshi Khalid’s cinematography. While he has consistently demonstrated excellence in his previous works such as Thallumaala (2022), Love (2020) and Kappela (2020), his cinematography in Thundu fails to enhance the movie effectively. In particular, the numerous extreme close-up shots used in the cheating scenes, seemingly employed to give an adrenaline rush, are out of sync with the overall tone of the movie, ultimately proving counterproductive. Gopi Sundar’s music too fails to make a significant contribution to the film and sometimes disregards the atmosphere presented.
